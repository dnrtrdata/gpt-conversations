Here are several recent, methodologically robust sources involving individuals and research teams who experimentally probed YouTube’s recommendation algorithm, including verified test results:

🔎 1. PNAS: “Short‑term exposure to filter-bubble recommendation systems has limited polarization effects” (2025)

Conducted four controlled experiments on nearly 9,000 participants watching real YouTube videos via a custom platform.

Manipulated recommendation feeds to create filter-bubble and rabbit‑hole scenarios.

Found no detectable short-term impact on political attitudes—even under intense recommendation bias—casting doubt on large-scale polarization claims.

🧪 2. PNAS: “Causally estimating the effect of YouTube’s recommender system using counterfactual bots” (early 2023 data, published recently)

Used a novel method with counterfactual bots—programmatic accounts mimicking real users, then switching to click exclusively algorithmic suggestions.

Allowed direct comparison between real and recommender-only behavior.

Found that relying solely on recommendations led to a more moderate content experience, especially for users who had been consuming far-right content.

🧷 3. PNAS (2022 audit of sock‑puppet behavior): “Auditing YouTube's recommendation system for ideological extremity”

Deployed 100,000 sock-puppet accounts across ideological spectrums.

Tracked nearly 10 million video watches across 120,000 channels.

Verified that recommendations tend toward ideological congeniality and a small but nonzero proportion (∼2 – 2.5 %) of recommendations came from extremist or conspiracy channels, encountered by ~36 % of users—up to ~40 % for extreme right users.

😡 4. arXiv (January 25, 2025): “YouTube Recommendations Reinforce Negative Emotions: Auditing Algorithmic Bias with Emotion‑agentic Sock Puppets”

Simulated accounts focused on emotional preference (e.g. anger, grievance).

Found that YouTube’s algorithm amplifies negative emotional content over time, reinforcing emotional biases and suggesting “emotional filter bubbles.”

arXiv 2025 (emotional bias)	Emotion-driven puppets	Reinforcement of negative emotional content over time
arXiv 2023 (rabbit‑holes modeling)	Autoplay bot large-scale audit	Quantifiable mapping of rabbit-hole trajectories
🔧 Why These Are Trustworthy

Involve real participants or bots controlled in experiments, not just observational correlational data.

Incorporate counterfactual design, large-scale sock‑puppet audits, or real-user controlled trials.

Published in reputable peer-reviewed journals (PNAS) or preprint with clear methodologies and reproducibility.

✅ Bottom Line for You

These high-quality, recent experimental studies provide some of the most rigorous and verified insights into YouTube’s recommendation ecosystem:

The polarization narrative is challenged by user experiments showing minimal short-term attitudinal shifts.

Algorithm causality is teased apart via counterfactual bots showing moderation rather than radicalization.

Ideological and emotional biases exist but often at relatively low rates or manifest in nuanced emotional reinforcement.

Rabbit-holes can be modeled and quantified in large volumes via bot walks.

If you’d like access to specific experimental details (e.g. datasets, code, bot configurations), or comparisons between methodologies, I’d be happy to dig further.

Audit size: 1.7 million video recommendations from 2019, analyzed using network graph methods and Markov transition probabilities.

Findings (numerical):

Topical filter bubbles: Entertainment content showed higher persistence and reinforcement than news content—recommendations favor entertainment.

Algorithmic redirection: Probability of transitioning from a news video to entertainment was significantly higher than vice versa.

Quantified impact: The likelihood of being recommended another entertainment video after a news video was markedly larger than the probability of receiving news after entertainment content.

3. Ivan Srba et al. (arXiv Oct 2022) – “Misinformation Filter Bubbles”

Source: arXiv audit paper 
Taylor & Francis Online

Design: 17,405 unique videos watched by sock-puppet agents; 2,914 manually annotated for misinformation; classifier accuracy ≈ 0.82 for remaining videos.

Key verified metrics:

Speed of entering misinformation bubbles: bots quickly formed bubble behaviors.

Bubble bursting: soon after watching debunking content, misinformation recommendations dropped sharply.

Numerical findings:

Transition effect: Debunking exposures led to rapid reduction in misinformation suggestions; magnitude varied by topic but consistently large across domains.

No overall decline in bubble exposure over time across comparison with earlier audits.

Methodology: Emotionally‐agentic sock puppets were created with assigned emotional preferences (e.g. anger, grievance). Each puppet watched videos aligned with their assigned emotion.

Findings (quantitative):

Negative emotional content increased in proportion over successive recommendation layers.

Amplification effect was stronger for negative emotions than for neutral or positive.

Contextual recommendation (not personalized) sometimes produced greater bias reinforcement than direct personalization.

Scale: 100,000 trained sock puppets watched 9,930,110 videos across 120,073 channels.

Findings:

Ideological congeniality: Recommendations skewed toward users’ existing political leanings; effect stronger for right-leaning users, especially deep in watch trails.

Ideological extremity: Slight increase in extremity of recommended videos deeper in trail—but quantified as “not meaningful” on average.

Problematic channel exposure (IDW, Alt‑right, conspiracy, QAnon categories): Max ~2.5 % of recommendations, encountered by 36–40 % of users overall and up to 40 % for extreme-right users.

Focus: How different configuration choices affect audit outcomes (e.g. using logged-in vs logged-out accounts, depth of crawl, seed selection, etc.).

Verifiable results:

Use of logged-in accounts yields more realistic and stable recommendation trajectories.

Audit design parameters (e.g. tree depth, number of paths) significantly alter observed bias magnitude.

A recency bias—YouTube favors recently posted content—which dampens influence from older seed histories.

Conclusion: Audit results are highly sensitive to methodological configuration; this influences interpretability and comparability.

📊 Comparative Data Table
Study / Authors	Method	Size / Scale	Key Quantitative Findings
Mozilla Foundation (2022)	Real user feedback	22,722 users	“Don’t recommend”: 43 % suppression; “Dislike”: 12 % suppression
Huang & Yang (2024)	Network + Markov	1.7M recs (2019)	High transition probability from news→entertainment vs reverse
Srba et al. (2022)	Sock‑puppet audit	17,405 videos; classifier acc ≈ 0.82	Misinformation bubbles form quickly; debunking sharply reduces them
Habib & Nithyanand (2025)	Emotion puppets	Multiple puppet runs over time	Negative emotion reinforced over time; context signal stronger
Haroon et al. (2023) PNAS	Large sock‑puppet	100K puppets; 9.93M videos	Ideological bias moderate; extremity small; problematic recs ~2.5 %
Chandio et al. (2023) arXiv	Meta-methodology	Multiple audit configurations	Audit design directly impacts measured bias; logged-in and recency matter
📌 Key Verified Takeaways

Negative user feedback tools (Mozilla) show only modest impact (12–43 % reduction).

News-to-entertainment bias is statistically reinforced; entertainment is more likely recommended than news (Huang & Yang).

Misinformation bubbles appear rapidly but are reversible via debunking content exposures (Srba et al.).

Emotional bias amplification creates negativity filter bubbles, especially for anger and grievance (Habib & Nithyanand).

Ideological bias exists but is limited: extremist content comprises ≤ 2.5 % of recommendations, yet is still shown to ~36–40 % of users (Haroon et al.).

Audit methodology matters significantly—recommendation trajectories and bias magnitude vary based on design choices (Chandio et al.).

📎 Why These Are Reliable

All rely on controlled experiments using real users or thoughtfully designed bots/pupils.

They provide quantitative metrics and exposure percentages, not just anecdotal trends.

Datasets are large-scale and systematically annotated or modeled (manual or classifier-based).

Methods make explicit the audit parameters and limitations—for transparency and reproducibility.

✅ Summary

These studies collectively deliver a rich, well-quantified tapestry of how YouTube’s algorithm behaves:

User controls are weak‑moderate in effect, not absolute.

Topical bias systematically shifts users from news to entertainment.

Filter bubbles form fast, though they can be disrupted through intentional exposure.

Negative emotional content is amplified more strongly than other emotional types.

Ideological bias is present but modest, with extreme content being rare but still non‑negligible.

Audit configurations are critical—choices in experimental design directly dictate observed outcomes.

Let me know if you'd like the raw audit datasets (e.g. HSri et al. misinfo classifier outputs, Haroon’s puppets logs, Huang & Yang's transition matrices, etc.) or further breakdowns by topic, emotion, or demographic conditions.
