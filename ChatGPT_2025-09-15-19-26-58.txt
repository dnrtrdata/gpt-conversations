🗂️ How to use these

Most of these sources offer A–Z browsable glossaries covering technical, narrative, and stylistic terminology.

PDF and academic sources (e.g., Pulsipher, Okanagan, Open Book) provide deeper, thorough treatments.

Community and industry sites (StudioBinder, Machinations, Code Wizards) tie terms to real-world usage.

Wikipedia entries are excellent all‑round references, though less narrative in tone.

If you'd like direct links, downloadable PDFs, or help filtering by sub-topic (e.g., cinematography vs. editing, tabletop vs. digital game design, character vs. plot devices), I’d be happy to help!
