This thread and the content added to it will focus on creating anything I can find that I think may help/entertain me using AI. Keep a single Markdown document recording the info gained in this conversation and call it "Shit to build with AI (and how!).md"

Update this document everytime more info is added and **IMPORTANT** parse links and update the document ENTIRE IN THE BACKGROUND every time a link is provided.

Here's the first link: https://youtube.com/watch?=5ITeLrYu8aM
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


It looks like there was an internal server error while trying to retrieve the transcription for the provided YouTube link. Could you please provide another link or try again later?
--------------------------------------
User:


**REMEMBER THIS!** From now on, you will process any link provided to make sure it is in the https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID format. If it is not, you will convert the link using the method detailed below BEFORE parsing the link. Here is the conversion method to apply when appropriate:

### Detailed Step-by-Step Instruction for Another GPT:

1. **Input Link**: Given an input link in the format https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?PARAMETERS.
2. **Extract Video ID**:
   - Identify the segment immediately following https://youtu.be/.
   - Extract this segment up to but not including the ? (if it exists).
   - This segment is the VIDEO_ID.
3. **Construct Output Link**:
   - Start with https://youtube.com/watch?v=.
   - Append the extracted VIDEO_ID.
   - The resulting link should be https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID.

4. **Example Conversion**:
   - Input: https://youtu.be/f48MN5HBlOg?si=f4d1N60oeS1kd983
   - Extracted Video ID: f48MN5HBlOg
   - Output: https://youtube.com/watch?v=f48MN5HBlOg

### Application to Any Provided Link:

From this point forward, apply these instructions to any provided YouTube link in the https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?PARAMETERS format to convert it to the https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID format. 

---

This ensures that any YouTube link in the short youtu.be format is correctly transformed into the standard youtube.com format.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Got it! I will now ensure that any YouTube link provided is in the correct format before processing it. Please provide the link again, and I'll proceed with the correct format.
