Compile the story from the wiki entries I add about season two of The Last of Us HBO show.

Plot
Joel swears to Ellie that his story about the Fireflies[a] is true; Ellie hesitates before replying "Okay", and they walk towards the safe settlement of Jackson, Wyoming. In Salt Lake City, a group of surviving Fireflies are burying their dead from the hospital massacre.[b] One of them, Abby, insists that they track down Joel but is dissuaded by Owen, who suggests they regroup in Seattle first. She vows to kill Joel slowly.

Five years later, at the end of 2028, Ellie and Joel have become increasingly estranged from each other. During combat training, Jesse orders restraint against Ellie for fear of Joel's retaliation, but Ellie demands equal treatment. Joel's brother, Tommy, takes Ellie off patrol at Joel's request, but Ellie insists on following through with her assignment. While clearing out a group of infected in an abandoned supermarket with her close friend Dina, Ellie is confronted by a new type capable of stalking her and moving silently; she kills it after it bites her and they later report its existence to the council in Jackson.

With Joel and the other townspeople rebuilding the derelict buildings across Jackson, Maria instructs him to work faster in order to accommodate the town's growing population of refugees. Joel suggests that the town council stop allowing them in, to which Maria points out that both he and Ellie came to Jackson as refugees. Joel has his session with psychotherapist Gail, who admits her resentment toward him for killing her husband Eugene. Overcome with emotion, Joel confesses to saving Ellie. At a New Year's Eve party, Dina dances with Ellie and they kiss, prompting anger and a homophobic slur from Seth. After Joel attacks Seth, Ellie tells him she does not need his help, and he leaves. She later encounters him playing guitar on his porch but does not speak to him.

Unbeknownst to the townsfolk, infected tendrils begin to enter Jackson through a broken pipe as Abby and her friends arrive nearby and observe the town at a distance.

I. CLOSURE AND CONSEQUENCE  
Joel and Ellie return to Jackson, Wyoming, after the massacre at the Firefly hospital. Joel swears that his story about the Fireflies is true, and Ellie, after a pause, accepts it with a hesitant "Okay." Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, surviving Fireflies bury their dead. Among them is Abby, who mourns her loss and declares her intention to find and kill Joel slowly. Owen, one of her companions, encourages patience and a return to Seattle.

II. FIVE YEARS LATER — JACKSON, 2028  
By the end of 2028, Joel and Ellie are emotionally distant, their bond frayed. Ellie’s independent streak emerges during combat training, where she insists on being treated like everyone else despite Jesse’s caution—driven by fear of Joel’s retaliation. Joel has asked Tommy to keep Ellie off patrols, but Ellie defies this and takes her assignment regardless. During a run with her friend Dina, Ellie encounters a new variant of infected—stealthy and silent. It bites her, but she kills it and survives. The two report this mutated threat to the Jackson council.

III. SETTLEMENT GROWING PAINS  
As Jackson grows, Joel participates in reconstruction efforts. Maria demands faster progress to make room for new refugees, a population Joel argues against. She reminds him that he and Ellie were once outsiders too. Joel attends a session with Gail, a psychotherapist whose husband Eugene he killed during the Firefly hospital incident. Her bitterness lingers, and Joel—crushed by guilt and isolation—confesses that he saved Ellie’s life.

IV. FRACTURES AND REJECTION  
During a New Year’s Eve party, Ellie shares a dance and a kiss with Dina. Seth, a fellow townsman, responds with a homophobic slur. Joel intervenes and attacks Seth, but Ellie rejects his protection and scolds him for overstepping. Later, she sees him playing guitar alone but ignores him. Their distance remains unresolved, marked by years of unspoken tension.

V. UNSEEN THREATS  
As the people of Jackson carry on unaware, infected begin to breach the town’s defenses via a broken pipe. Nearby, Abby and her companions arrive. They watch the settlement from afar, preparing for what lies ahead.

"Through the Valley" is the second episode of the second season of the American post-apocalyptic drama television series The Last of Us. Written by series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Mark Mylod, it aired on HBO on April 20, 2025. The episode follows Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Jesse (Young Mazino) on patrol as they search for Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Dina (Isabela Merced), while Tommy (Gabriel Luna) prepares for an attack on Jackson, Wyoming, and Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) seeks revenge against Joel.

The episode was filmed in early 2024. The attack on Jackson, written to provide ongoing character conflict and motivations, was filmed over almost four weeks and required more than 600 visual effects shots, around 100 extras, and dozens of stunt performers. The writers chose to depict Joel's death early in the season as it sets its narrative in motion. Critics praised the episode's direction, cinematography, writing, and Pascal, Ramsey, and Dever's performances; some felt the Jackson attack overshadowed Joel's death, while others lauded the juxtaposition. The episode had 643,000 viewers on linear television.

Plot
Sheltering with her group in an abandoned lodge near Jackson, Wyoming, Abby has a dream in which she warns her past self not to enter the room in which her father was killed.[a] When she awakens, she focuses on her mission to kill Joel, while her friends, concerned about the town's security and her lack of a plan, consider retreating. Abby leaves to survey Jackson, and her friend Owen tells the rest of the group that he will try to convince her to return to Seattle.

Ellie tells Jesse that she wants to go on patrol with Joel, but Jesse informs her that he has already left with Dina. Abby accidentally awakens a large horde of infected hiding under the snow, and is rescued by Joel and Dina. In Jackson, the infected tendrils are discovered, redirecting the horde to the town, leading to a battle in which Jackson suffers heavy damage and casualties; Tommy defends his wife Maria against a bloater by drawing it away and killing it with a flamethrower.

Abby lures Joel and Dina to the lodge, saying she has friends who can help them defend Jackson. After knocking out Dina, Abby reveals herself to be the daughter of the Firefly doctor who Joel killed in Salt Lake City.[a] She shoots Joel in the knee with a shotgun and repeatedly hits his knee wound with a golf club, beating him until the club breaks in two. Ellie, who had been searching for Joel and Dina, is restrained and forced to watch as Abby kills Joel by impaling his neck with the broken club. Ellie swears to kill Abby as revenge, but the group spares her and leaves. Jackson begins to recover from the carnage of the battle, as Ellie, Dina, and Jesse return home with Joel's body.

"Through the Valley" was written by series co-creator Craig Mazin.[6]
"Through the Valley" was written by The Last of Us series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Mark Mylod.[6] Mazin had wanted Mylod to work on the first season, but he was busy directing Succession. After Mylod mentioned wanting to work with Mazin during a panel, Mazin sent him the episode's script, which Mylod read and found irresistible.[7] Mylod previously directed the Game of Thrones episode "The Broken Man", which marked the first acting role for Bella Ramsey (who portrays Ellie).[8] In The Last of Us Part II (2020), the game on which the second season is based, Joel is paired with Tommy on patrol and Ellie is paired with Dina; Joel was paired with Dina in the episode to show their relationship, as they do not interact in the game, and to more closely connect her with Joel's death.[5] Keeping Dina separate from Ellie also made their ongoing relationship more ambiguous.[8] Mazin felt it gave another reason for Joel not to defend himself against Abby, as doing so risked Dina's life.[9] Ramsey found it added an element of resentment for Ellie, as Joel's final day was spent with Dina instead of her.[10] Pairing Ellie with Jesse also allowed focus on their relationship.[11]

Mazin learned of Joel's death during the development of Part II, before he began writing the show's first season.[9] He felt it was the correct narrative decision and did not wish to remove it from the series, reasoning that its brutality was an effective consequence of Joel's actions.[1]: 3:26  The writers spent a long time deciding which episode should depict Joel's death, and after briefly considering delaying it by an episode, they decided against it.[11] Mazin felt that plotting it in the season's second episode was appropriate after witnessing Joel and Ellie's strained relationship in the season premiere.[1]: 4:22  Neil Druckmann, the series co-creator who wrote and co-directed the games, thought it should occur early in the season, to parallel when its story begins in earnest[1]: 41:40  and because they believed that plotting it later would feel like they "were kind of dragging [their] feet".[5] Mazin also considered the real implications of leaving Joel's death until later in the season, understanding that viewers who had played the game would constantly be aware that it had not yet occurred,[5] and he did not want to feel like the writers were "toying with everybody".[11]

Mylod was more nervous about filming Joel's death than any of the action scenes due to its impact and his desire to do justice to the performances in the game.[1]: 20:17 [10] Druckmann felt that depicting its brutality allowed viewers to understand the characters' mindsets and their subsequent decisions,[5] though it was reduced slightly from the game due to the realism of a live-action adaptation.[8] Mazin and Mylod spent a long time discussing what level of violence to depict, believing it was necessary to justify Abby's actions while also being restrained enough to avoid glorifying it.[9] The brutality was initially intended to be more subtle but Mylod thought avoiding showing Joel's death felt "coy" and like they "were ducking out".[12] Mazin thought showing Abby's fists hitting Joel's face "would have been gratuitous and sort of action movie-ish", not reflective of the scene's true sadness and reprehensibility,[11] while Mylod "wanted to avoid overt torture".[7] Ellie's face is the last thing Joel sees, and his attempt to move after she pleads with him to get up demonstrated that he was aware of her presence, in contrast to the game.[5] Her crawl towards him was present in Mazin's first draft of the script, reflecting her need to be with him;[5] Mylod cried during one take. Some takes featured Manny spitting on Joel's corpse as he does in the game, but this was cut in favor of a better overall take.[12]

The writers felt the lack of a player character inherent in the video game allowed the series to show attacks on Jackson that are not depicted in the game.[1]: 7:16  Druckmann appreciated the depiction of the scale of the infected, which is implied in the games and first season but rarely demonstrated.[1]: 24:50  The writers' familiarity with the show's production allowed for more action sequences, through which they maintained connections to character development.[13][1]: 25:46  Mazin felt relationships like Tommy and Maria's increased the stakes, making it feel like more than "just a fight".[1]: 29:30  Druckmann thought the inclusion of the siege added more ongoing conflict for the characters as they are dealing with more losses than just Joel,[5] and Mazin felt the characters' loss of stability and safety in Jackson was palpable; Tommy's use of a flamethrower against the bloater is a reference to a weapon in the games and reflected the fear Mazin felt during gameplay.[8] The battle originally featured two or three bloaters but was trimmed to one in post-production.[14] The sequence with the frozen infected was expanded upon from the same scene in the game, whereas other sequences such as Abby being chased by the horde and saved by Joel were adapted more faithfully.[1]: 32:24

VI. EPISODE TWO: "THROUGH THE VALLEY" — APRIL 20, 2025

A. PROLOGUE: MOTIVE IN DREAMS  
Abby dreams of the day her father was killed in Salt Lake City, warning her past self not to enter the room where he died. Waking from the vision in a remote lodge near Jackson, she remains fixated on killing Joel. Her group grows uneasy at the lack of a clear plan and the increasing danger of remaining near town. Owen, her closest confidant, declares he will try to convince her to return to Seattle.

B. PARALLEL TRACKS: INTERSECTING MISSIONS  
Ellie asks Jesse if she can join Joel on patrol, but he informs her that Joel has already left with Dina—an intentional deviation from the game to deepen Ellie’s unresolved resentment. Meanwhile, Abby accidentally stirs a massive horde of infected hidden beneath the snow. Joel and Dina rescue her during the chaos, creating a moment of connection and trust, manipulated by Abby to her advantage.

C. JACKSON UNDER SIEGE  
Unseen infected tendrils, traced to a broken pipe, lure the awakened horde toward Jackson. A siege erupts, causing devastating casualties. Tommy protects Maria from a charging bloater, eventually killing it with a flamethrower—mirroring the in-game weapon and emphasizing Jackson's fragile security. The attack, an original addition to the show, underscores the communal stakes and deepens the sense of loss beyond Joel.

D. THE LODGE: REVENGE REALIZED  
Abby convinces Joel and Dina to follow her to the lodge under the pretense of rallying support for Jackson. Once inside, she incapacitates Dina and reveals her identity as the daughter of the Firefly surgeon Joel murdered. She cripples Joel with a shotgun blast to the knee and beats him with a golf club until it snaps in half. Ellie arrives, only to be restrained and forced to watch Joel die as Abby impales him with the broken club.

E. AFTERMATH: UNRESOLVED GRIEF  
Ellie vows to kill Abby, but Abby’s group spares her and leaves. Jesse and Dina recover Ellie and Joel’s body, returning to Jackson, which reels from both the horde attack and Joel’s murder. The episode ends with Ellie emotionally shattered, Jackson scarred, and the season’s core revenge arc ignited.

F. PRODUCTION AND NARRATIVE DESIGN  
1. WRITING STRATEGY  
   i. Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann decided early in development to depict Joel’s death in the second episode. The choice aligned with Druckmann's original pacing in the game and allowed the story to pivot quickly to Ellie’s transformation.
   ii. Pairing Joel with Dina was a deviation from the game that intensified Ellie’s sense of abandonment and emphasized her feelings of loss and jealousy.
   iii. Jesse’s presence with Ellie during the search allowed development of their dynamic, which is less explored in the game.

2. DIRECTION AND PERFORMANCE  
   i. Directed by Mark Mylod, whose prior work with Bella Ramsey on "Game of Thrones" established trust critical to this emotionally grueling episode.
   ii. Mylod found Joel’s death more nerve-wracking to film than the siege itself, striving for grounded realism without glorifying violence.
   iii. The decision to show Abby’s brutality sparingly, focusing instead on Ellie's reaction, heightened the emotional impact and avoided action-movie tropes.

3. TECHNICAL EXECUTION  
   i. The siege required over 600 VFX shots, 100 extras, and extensive stunt coordination over four weeks of filming.
   ii. The frozen-infected horde and bloater sequences were adapted from the game but expanded to illustrate the scale of danger the game often implies but rarely visualizes.
   iii. The flamethrower and bloater are direct nods to in-game mechanics and serve as continuity links for players.

4. THEMATIC DIRECTION  
   i. The Jackson siege added an existential layer to the plot: even fortified civilization is fragile.
   ii. Joel's death, framed through Ellie’s eyes, anchors the season's emotional weight and sets up a new arc centered on grief, vengeance, and moral ambiguity.

VII. ARC TRAJECTORY POST-EPISODE TWO  
Ellie’s path now mirrors Abby’s: defined by loss, vengeance, and ideological fracture. The foundation has been laid for dual protagonists navigating a post-truth moral landscape. With Jackson destabilized, personal motives and community survival are on a collision course.

"The Path" is the third episode of the second season of the American post-apocalyptic drama television series The Last of Us. Written by series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Peter Hoar, it aired on HBO on April 27, 2025. The episode follows Ellie (Bella Ramsey), Tommy (Gabriel Luna), Dina (Isabela Merced), and Jesse (Young Mazino) three months after the infected attack on their town of Jackson, Wyoming, as Ellie advocates for tracking down Joel's killers in Seattle.

The episode was filmed around April 2024. The writers wanted it to follow Jackson and pay respects to Joel, allowing the audience to grieve. The episode introduces the Seraphites, a religious group in Seattle whose designs were based on the game's; their facial scars required prosthetics, which underwent several designs. Critics praised the episode's direction, cinematography, writing, and Ramsey and Merced's chemistry, though some found the dialogue and themes heavy-handed. The episode had 768,000 viewers on linear television.

Plot
In the aftermath of the infected attack on Jackson, Wyoming, and Joel's death,[a] Tommy cleans Joel's body. Ellie is admitted to a hospital, and wakes up screaming upon remembering Joel's death. Three months later, while Jackson is still being rebuilt, Ellie is deemed physically ready to leave the hospital. She has a psychological evaluation with Gail, who asks her about her feelings on Joel's death and references their last session together where he expressed that he saved Ellie.[b] Though Gail probes for information, Ellie claims not to know what he was referencing and insists she has mentally recovered. She visits Joel's house, mourning for him until Dina arrives and tells her that the group who killed Joel—members of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF)—are based in Seattle.

At a town hall meeting, several townspeople oppose sending a group to Seattle to track down Joel's killers. Seth angrily argues that they should send the group to defend Jackson and its reputation, and Ellie reads a letter persuading the council to send the group out of justice, not revenge; the council rejects the proposal by majority. Tommy speaks with Gail and expresses his worry that Ellie will be out of control, and Gail tells him that some people cannot be saved from themselves and their actions. As Ellie prepares to leave for Seattle alone, Dina tells her she will join. Seth provides them with a horse and supplies, and helps them leave quietly.

The following morning, Ellie leaves coffee beans on Joel's grave. As she and Dina travel to Seattle, they discuss their kiss at the New Year's Eve party,[c] claiming it meant nothing. Dina says she thinks Jesse is sad, suspecting he is inherently so and fearing it otherwise may be due to her. Outside the city, Ellie and Dina encounter a group of dead Seraphites, including a young girl, causing Dina to vomit. They arrive in Seattle and notice a lack of WLF members. Meanwhile, a convoy of dozens of WLF soldiers march through the streets of Seattle with several armored vehicles.

"The Path" was written by series co-creator Craig Mazin.[7]
"The Path" was written by The Last of Us series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Peter Hoar.[7] Hoar's return to the series was announced in January 2024; he previously directed the first season episode "Long, Long Time".[8] The writers felt the episode's opening moments should pay respects to Joel, particularly due to the audience's grief; Mazin considered it important to focus specifically on family, as the series's opening episode initially focused on Joel, Sarah, and Tommy, of whom only Tommy remains.[9]: 2:10  Tommy originally had more dialogue in the scene addressing Ellie, but it was later cut to one line about Sarah.[10] Series co-creator Neil Druckmann—who co-directed and co-wrote The Last of Us Part II (2020), the game on which the second season is based—found the scene moving.[9]: 3:01 

Druckmann thought the series provided an opportunity to follow Jackson in the aftermath of Joel's death, which is featured in the game but not expanded upon.[9]: 3:01  The writers thought Ellie being forced to remain in hospital for three months gave her more time to reflect on Joel's death and consider her next actions.[9]: 5:42  Mazin considered the scene at Joel's grave an opportunity for viewers to grieve, akin to a funeral, before Ellie and Dina proceed to Seattle.[1]: 10:25  Mazin and Hoar compared Ellie's scene with Gail to a "fist fight", with both characters dueling with their words and intellect.[9]: 10:38  Mazin felt Ellie's retrieval of Joel's gun—instead of other belongings like his watch—reflects her relationship with Joel: they saved each other using violence and she intends to avenge him the same way.[9]: 17:29 

Mazin and Druckmann thought the town hall meeting allowed more characters to share their thoughts after Joel's death;[1]: 3:12  they spoke extensively about the scene before writing it. Druckmann cried when reading Mazin's draft, moved that someone would advocate for Joel; that it was Seth, who had clashed with Joel in the second season premiere, made it more impactful.[9]: 24:35  Mazin found Seth's advocacy a reflection of real life, wherein someone with opposing values shares the same opinion, making them question their instincts.[9]: 26:50  He found it difficult to write Ellie's speech, wanting it to be "pretty good, but not honest", and felt Bella Ramsey (who portrays Ellie) faced a similar challenge in performing it.[9]: 28:50  The credits feature a new version of Gustavo Santaolalla's song "The Path"—originally composed for the first game, The Last of Us (2013)—played on guitar by Tom Morello; it was recorded in Santaolalla's Los Angeles studio La Casa, and released as a digital single.[11]

Druckmann considered the Seraphites an extension of groups in the first season using different methods of survival: the Seraphites through religion.[1]: 8:00  Mazin compared the Seraphite father–daughter to real parental relationships in which children incessantly ask questions, best reflected in Cormac McCarthy's novel The Road (2006), which partly inspired Druckmann for the first game.[9]: 51:17  The Seraphites' designs were inspired by the game's development material, including the hairstyles and ponchos; costume designer Ann Foley considered the latter appropriate for the apocalyptic setting. Made of stiff canvas and broken down, they were designed with waterproof layers in case of rain, which occurred during filming, and the symbols on their clothes were hand-painted. Foley appreciated the episode's focus on non-infected characters. Prosthetics designer Barrie Gower and his team decided on consistent appearances based on the characters' features, like that young children would not have scars. Four versions of the scarring were tested, including inverted and keloid designs; depressive scarring, similar to the game, was chosen but intentionally made less intimidating to keep the characters' intentions unclear. The scar prosthetics were made of a paste-based appliance and thickened with a food mixer;[12] they took around 30–45 minutes to apply to the actors. Gower wanted to ensure they did not inhibit the performances or "take up too much space".[12]

VIII. EPISODE THREE: "THE PATH" — APRIL 27, 2025

A. THREE MONTHS LATER: STILL WOUNDED  
Following the horde attack and Joel’s death, Jackson is slowly rebuilding. Tommy cleans Joel's body in private. Ellie, hospitalized for three months, wakes screaming from nightmares of Joel’s murder. Upon release, she undergoes a psychological evaluation with Gail, who probes Joel’s final confession. Ellie denies knowledge of what he meant, suppressing her grief and avoiding vulnerability.

B. FAREWELL TO JOEL  
Ellie visits Joel’s home alone. Surrounded by his possessions, she mourns silently until Dina finds her. Dina reveals that Joel's killers are affiliated with the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) and are based in Seattle. The visit—coupled with Ellie retrieving Joel’s gun rather than his watch—cements her resolve: she intends to honor Joel’s legacy through violence, not sentiment.

C. THE TOWN SPLITS  
A town hall meeting is held to debate retaliation. Most oppose sending a party to Seattle, citing defense priorities. Seth, despite prior tensions with Joel, unexpectedly argues for vengeance as a matter of justice and dignity. Ellie reads a letter urging the council to act out of principle, not revenge. The plea is denied. Seth later secretly assists Ellie and Dina with supplies and a horse, enabling their covert departure.

D. FAREWELL AND DENIAL  
The next morning, Ellie places coffee beans on Joel’s grave—an understated ritual of goodbye. As she and Dina leave, they discuss their New Year’s kiss. Both pretend it meant nothing. Dina expresses concern for Jesse’s emotional state, unsure whether he is inherently melancholic or troubled by their complicated dynamic. Their shared silence and quiet rationalizations expose emotional walls neither is ready to breach.

E. ARRIVAL IN SEATTLE  
Near Seattle, the pair discover the corpses of Seraphites, including a dead child—an image that causes Dina to vomit. The brutality of the outside world creeps in, even before they confront the WLF. Within the city, a convoy of armored WLF soldiers marches through, preparing for battle. The scope of the threat dwarfs Jackson’s small town.

F. INTRODUCTION OF THE SERAPHITES  
The episode introduces the Seraphites, a religious faction with distinctive facial scarring and survivalist customs. While their full role remains unclear, their iconography and austerity contrast with the militarism of the WLF. Their ambiguous intentions position them as a wildcard in Seattle’s fragile balance of power.

G. PRODUCTION AND THEMATIC DESIGN  
1. WRITING STRATEGY  
   i. Written by Craig Mazin, the episode functions as a thematic funeral, exploring communal grief, moral ambiguity, and internalized guilt.  
   ii. The scene at Joel’s grave provides narrative closure while quietly shifting Ellie toward action.  
   iii. The town hall scene underscores how shared tragedy does not always unite people—morality splinters under pressure.

2. DIRECTORIAL TONE  
   i. Directed by Peter Hoar, who also helmed “Long, Long Time,” the episode balances interior drama with ominous world-building.  
   ii. Dialogue between Gail and Ellie resembles a psychological duel, exposing Ellie’s inner fractures.  
   iii. Emotional subtlety defines the visual language—extended silences, unfinished sentences, and hesitant touches replace exposition.

3. DESIGN OF THE SERAPHITES  
   i. The Seraphites' visual identity stems from in-game art, adapted for realism and ambiguity.  
   ii. Scars were crafted to look ritualistic without being grotesque, applied in under 45 minutes to preserve actor performance.  
   iii. Costumes—ponchos layered with waterproofed canvas—evoked religious isolation while remaining utilitarian.  
   iv. Their minimal presence foreshadows future ideological conflict with Ellie’s vengeance-driven mission.

IX. ARC MOMENTUM POST-EPISODE THREE  
With Jackson behind her, Ellie steps onto a darker path. Her cause is framed not as justice, but something more complicated—unspoken guilt, thwarted love, unresolved resentment. "The Path" signals not just geographic movement but moral descent, as Seattle becomes a crucible for what Ellie is becoming.

"Day One" is the fourth episode of the second season of the American post-apocalyptic drama television series The Last of Us. Written by series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Kate Herron, it aired on HBO on May 4, 2025. The episode follows Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) in Seattle as they search for Abby, a member of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) who killed Joel. It introduces WLF leader Isaac (Jeffrey Wright), who joined the group after defecting from a government agency.

The episode adapts and expands upon several scenes from The Last of Us Part II (2020), the video game on which the season is based. Ellie's performance of A-ha's "Take On Me" was adapted directly; Mazin and Herron considered it among the most important scenes. Similar importance was placed upon Ellie and Dina's intimacy scenes, which occurred earlier in the game. Critics praised the episode's direction, cinematography, writing, action sequences, and Merced and Wright's performances.

Plot
In 2018, Federal Disaster Response Agency (FEDRA) sergeant Isaac Dixon chastises his team for mocking civilians they have harassed. They encounter a Washington Liberation Front (WLF) group led by Hanrahan. Isaac kills his squad, only sparing the idealistic Burton, and reveals his allegiance to the WLF. Eleven years later, Isaac, now the WLF's leader, interrogates a Seraphite for his group's location, torturing him with a heated pan. After realizing the Seraphite would rather be tortured than share the truth, he kills him. Burton, standing guard outside with another WLF member, says he deserved it.

Ellie and Dina begin their first day exploring Seattle in their search for Abby, with Dina covertly taking a pregnancy test. In Capitol Hill, the two stumble upon the aftermath of conflicts between FEDRA and the WLF. Deciding to advance by night, they decide to hide out in a music store where Ellie discovers a guitar and serenades Dina with A-ha's song "Take On Me".

While proceeding through a former television station that night, they encounter the bodies of several WLF soldiers brutally murdered by the Seraphites, causing Dina to vomit again. Evading an incoming WLF squad, Ellie and Dina escape through the subway, where the WLF squad unintentionally attracts the infected and is killed. Ellie allows an infected to bite her arm to save Dina before they escape to an abandoned theater together. A heartbroken Dina prepares to shoot Ellie, but Ellie reveals her immunity and offers to sleep in isolation to prove that she will not turn.

Once it is clear to Dina that Ellie is immune, Dina confesses that she is pregnant. Fueled by the emotional intensity, the two have sex for the first time, finally consummating their feelings for one another. The next morning, Dina admits that Jesse fathered her baby, but shares that she wants a future and a family together with Ellie, who reciprocates the sentiment. The two overhear chatter on a walkie-talkie that the WLF—including Abby's friend Nora—are based at the Lakehill hospital. Ellie suggests Dina stay behind and protect her pregnancy, but Dina insists on going forward with Ellie.

"Day One" was written by series co-creator Craig Mazin.[6]
"Day One" was written by The Last of Us series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Kate Herron.[6] Herron is a fan of the games on which the series is based, having played them during COVID-19 lockdowns.[7] She reached out to the showrunners in hopes of working on the series. Eben Bolter, her friend who worked as a director of photography on the first season, "put a good word in" for her.[2] Herron was excited to speak with Neil Druckmann, the co-showrunner who co-directed and co-wrote the games, even if she did not secure the job.[2] She considered dressing as Ellie for her Zoom meeting with Mazin and Druckmann.[7] She spoke with them about her love for the games and series, and they later asked her to direct an episode.[2] She felt they assigned her "Day One" because she talked "a lot about Ellie and Dina".[8] Herron enjoyed the episode's tonal shifts, such as the discussion of pride flags immediately before encountering the burned-out tank.[9] She compared the tonal shifts to a music scale, feeling some scenes built up to others—like the Capitol Hill scenes to one in the music store, and the television station scene to the one in the subway—while others reset the tone entirely, such as Isaac's interrogation sequence.[2] An intimacy coordinator was present for the latter.[7]

The episode's opening with FEDRA soldiers was inspired by environmental storytelling in The Last of Us Part II (2020), the game on which the second season is based; the player can discover a burned-out tank and notes revealing that some FEDRA soldiers began deserting.[1]: 2:17  Herron felt that focusing on Burton, a new recruit who asks questions, could help the audience learn the soldiers' dynamics.[7] The writers were intrigued by the similarities between Ellie and the Seraphites, with both attempting to respect and protect deceased figures: Ellie with Joel, the Seraphites with their Prophet. Druckmann felt that with the passage of time since their deaths, the deceased evolved from being real people into more of an idea.[1]: 10:14  The television station scenes were inspired by the game's stealth gameplay; Mazin showed production designer Don Macauley the in-game location as a reference before the set was built as he wanted to replicate elements of the gameplay.[1]: 26:42  The hanging bodies were played by stunt performers in harnesses.[10]: 7:07  Herron felt that setting the scene at night, instead of daytime like in the game, made it more frightening and intimidating.[2] She largely planned the scene independently as the crew was working on "Through the Valley".[7] Mazin had intentionally added references to Ellie's love of space and astronauts in the first season (like mentioning Sally Ride in "Kin") to set up the second season; in "Day One", she mentions the fate of the Apollo 1 astronauts to Dina.[1]: 16:14 

The Capitol Hill scenes were adapted closely from the game,[1]: 16:14  in which they were optional; Druckmann was interested to discover which ones Mazin would include.[1]: 18:22  They considered the music store scene especially important,[10]: 4:18  with Herron considering it one of her favorite scenes from the game.[10]: 5:41  Ellie's performance of "Take On Me" matches the scene in the game. Druckmann sent a clip of it during filming to A-ha guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, who was moved.[1]: 19:08  Mazin thought the inclusion of the song was justified by narrative events, as Dina falls in love with Ellie as she performs.[1]: 19:36  Herron found the scene among the most intimidating to film,[2] and Mazin was nervous as he felt it was one of the most meaningful to many people. He thought the scene matched the one from the game in some ways while still remaining unique in others, such as the context of Ellie and Dina's relationship; by the time it took place in the game, they were already a couple.[1]: 21:16  The filming was Druckmann's first day on set for the season, during which he showed Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready around the set.[1]: 23:29  For Herron, the playing of a song for one's crush made the scene relatable to viewers.[9] She filmed several different takes, including some where Ellie avoided eye contact and Dina was "really into the song", to allow the best version to be selected during editing.[2][8] Mazin approved Herron's request to add a caterpillar in the background,[8] which Herron felt reflected his willingness to collaborate.[2] Bella Ramsey, who portrays Ellie, was asked to "tone it down" with their performance to make Ellie sound like a regular guitar player, rather than an experienced one like Ramsey.[11]

The series's replacement of spores—the vector through which infection is spread in the games—with tendrils prompted Mazin to alter the scene in which Ellie reveals her immunity to Dina, delaying Dina's belief. Mazin considered the scene an enjoyable exercise in writing and acting, likening it to defusing a bomb.[1]: 35:22  Herron found it challenging to balance the trust levels of both characters, requiring several takes.[2] Ellie's decision to isolate herself from Dina to prove her immunity was based on Joel and Tess's similar treatment of Ellie in "Infected".[1]: 37:43  Herron wanted the scene to maintain tension until the moment Ellie and Dina kiss, making it feel earned and "like a relief, but also enough of a surprise".[9][8] Their sex scene was different in the game, taking place much earlier in Jackson, and the writers' decision to move it to Seattle prompted several other changes to earlier episodes.[1]: 39:43  Herron wondered if fans of the game would accept the change but personally appreciated it, considering it more impactful[8] and logical considering the series's episodic nature.[12] Kathy Kadler, an intimacy coordinator, was present during production.[13] Mazin felt the more fearful state of LGBTQ rights in 2003—when the outbreak occurs in the series—meant Dina was more scared to reveal herself to Ellie.[1]: 39:43  Herron, who came out as bisexual in her 30s, found Dina's coming out "very relatable and beautiful"[8] and wanted to portray it authentically, hoping viewers would realize they are not alone.[9] She considered Ellie and Dina's relationship relatable, particularly in their mutual hesitancy.[8]

X. EPISODE FOUR: "DAY ONE" — MAY 4, 2025

A. DUAL TIMELINES: ORIGINS OF THE WLF  
In 2018, FEDRA sergeant Isaac Dixon scolds his unit for abusing civilians. During an encounter with the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), Isaac kills his own squad, sparing only the idealistic Burton, and defects to the WLF. Eleven years later, Isaac is the WLF’s brutal leader. He tortures a captured Seraphite with a heated pan, ultimately killing him when he refuses to speak. Outside, Burton defends the act, signaling the WLF’s hardened ethos.

B. FIRST DAY IN SEATTLE  
Ellie and Dina begin their search for Abby in Capitol Hill, encountering evidence of past FEDRA-WLF conflict. Dina secretly takes a pregnancy test. They decide to explore the city by night and shelter in a music store. There, Ellie finds a guitar and performs A-ha’s "Take On Me" for Dina—an adapted scene from the game used here to signal emotional vulnerability and deepen their bond.

C. STATION SLAUGHTER  
Later that night, while moving through a derelict television station, the pair discover WLF corpses strung up by the Seraphites. The gruesome display causes Dina to vomit again. As they flee the scene, a WLF squad gives chase but is overwhelmed by infected in the subway. In a moment of desperation, Ellie lets one bite her to save Dina, revealing her immunity.

D. TRUST, REVELATIONS, AND INTIMACY  
They escape to an abandoned theater, where Dina nearly shoots Ellie, assuming she is infected. Ellie shows her the bite mark and offers to sleep alone to prove she won’t turn. Convinced, Dina admits she is pregnant—with Jesse’s child—and confesses her feelings for Ellie. The two have sex, culminating their emotional arc from the previous episodes.

E. MORNING AFTER AND FORWARD MOVEMENT  
The next morning, Dina expresses her desire to raise the child with Ellie and build a future together. Ellie reciprocates. Their new bond is tested when they hear on a walkie-talkie that Nora and other WLF members are at the Lakehill hospital. Ellie insists on pursuing them; Dina, despite her condition, chooses to join.

F. PRODUCTION AND THEMATIC STRUCTURE  
1. WRITING AND DIRECTION  
   i. Written by Craig Mazin and directed by Kate Herron, who was drawn to Ellie and Dina’s arc and the tonal variety of the episode.  
   ii. The title “Day One” refers to both Isaac’s first day with the WLF and Ellie’s first full day in Seattle, marking narrative symmetry.  
   iii. Herron likened the episode’s structure to musical scales—building and resetting tone between horror, tenderness, and dread.

2. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND BACKSTORY  
   i. Isaac’s origin as a former FEDRA sergeant contextualizes the WLF’s brutality, giving the antagonist group ideological texture.  
   ii. Burton’s survival from the FEDRA massacre creates a secondary character lens through which to explore loyalty and disillusionment.

3. ICONIC MOMENTS FROM THE GAME  
   i. “Take On Me” was recreated almost exactly from the game and filmed under pressure, with attention to emotional subtlety.  
   ii. Bella Ramsey deliberately played the song with less skill to reflect Ellie’s in-world experience.  
   iii. The moment acts as a narrative fulcrum for Dina’s emotional clarity—she falls in love as Ellie performs.

4. INTIMACY AND EMOTIONAL RISK  
   i. The sex scene, moved from earlier in the game, was rewritten to reflect accumulated tension and vulnerability post-trauma.  
   ii. An intimacy coordinator ensured scenes felt authentic, with the shift to Seattle adding gravity and credibility.  
   iii. Herron, who came out later in life, brought personal authenticity to Dina’s emotional arc and coming out.

5. IMMUNITY REVEAL AND TRUST BUILDING  
   i. The tendrils, replacing spores in the show’s canon, required new logic for Ellie’s immunity reveal and trust calibration.  
   ii. Ellie’s choice to isolate herself mirrored Joel and Tess’s past decisions, tying the reveal back to season one.  
   iii. Dina’s belief only comes after Ellie sleeps beside her without turning, reinforcing their emerging bond.

6. PRODUCTION DESIGN AND ATMOSPHERE  
   i. Herron used night settings, particularly in the TV station, to amplify horror.  
   ii. Seraphite kills and infected swarm tactics reference in-game stealth gameplay, staged with stunt actors and hanging rigs.  
   iii. A background caterpillar in the music store was Herron’s addition, symbolizing quiet transformation and intimacy.

XI. ARC POSITIONING POST-EPISODE FOUR  
Ellie and Dina are emotionally bonded but now face overlapping threats: WLF reprisal, Seraphite instability, and pregnancy in a warzone. "Day One" thematically bridges vengeance and connection, positioning Ellie at the edge of an irreversible path as love and grief collide.

ACT THREE: THE PATH (CONTINUED)

SCENE IX: GHOSTS IN THE CITY  
Beat 1: Ellie and Dina enter the city proper. Buildings loom above them like broken monuments. Nature is clawing its way back—ivy on rebar, vines in the street. The WLF insignia is painted over old FEDRA warnings, fresh enough to show authority, weathered enough to suggest decay.

Beat 2: They encounter remnants of battles past: charred FEDRA checkpoints, spent shell casings, bodies riddled with arrows and bullets. A note in a dead soldier’s hand references a Seraphite ambush. The ideological war between militarism and faith is everywhere. Ellie and Dina try to stay unseen.

Beat 3: A nearby structure collapses under tension from weather and rot. It startles them. The tension never leaves. Ellie keeps her knife out even when they rest. Dina watches her sleep, worry etched across her face.

Beat 4: They make camp in an old, half-flooded pharmacy. There, they share canned peaches and whisper beneath a skylight cracked by time. Dina confesses that she used to want to leave Jackson, to see the world. Ellie, more haunted, says she never wanted to leave again.

SCENE X: THE NARROWING TUNNELS  
Beat 1: They traverse underground subway routes, hoping to avoid WLF patrols. The air is thick, damp, and filled with the smell of rust and mold. Dina’s breathing grows labored. She tries to hide it. Ellie notices.

Beat 2: In one tunnel, the floor is slick with old blood. There’s a makeshift grave. A Seraphite symbol is drawn on the wall above it. Dina turns away.

Beat 3: A distant roar echoes. Infected. Ellie motions silence. They push ahead in darkness lit only by flashlights—one flickers. Ellie swaps batteries. A faint whimper echoes from behind. It's not human. They run.

Beat 4: They surface into an overgrown park. Light cuts through mist. There’s momentary peace—then gunfire. A WLF convoy rolls through a nearby road. Dina pulls Ellie behind a log. Among the soldiers: Nora.

Beat 5: Ellie stares at her, her jaw tightening. A name becomes a target. Dina whispers that they should wait, but Ellie marks the convoy’s direction in her notebook. The hunt is focused now.

ACT FOUR: MIRRORS

SCENE XI: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR  
Beat 1: In a secure WLF compound, Abby spars with Manny in a gym repurposed from a warehouse. She fights like a machine—relentless, precise. She wins. Her peers cheer, but it’s hollow. She returns to her bunk and removes a photo of her father from the wall. She stares. She doesn’t cry.

Beat 2: Isaac briefs the WLF on increased Seraphite activity near the waterfront. He’s methodical, terrifying in his calm. Burton asks about Abby’s absence. Isaac says she’s following her own assignments. There's tension—Isaac doesn’t like rogue actors, even favored ones.

Beat 3: Abby and Owen talk by a watchtower overlooking a foggy lake. She asks if he believes in redemption. He says he doesn’t know. Abby says she doesn’t either, but she’s still chasing something.

SCENE XII: TOWARD THE HOSPITAL  
Beat 1: Ellie and Dina take shelter in an old synagogue. Rain drums against the stained glass. They dry off. Ellie jokes about becoming a rabbi. Dina smiles. It’s the first time in days she looks peaceful.

Beat 2: Ellie cleans her weapons methodically. Dina watches. “You don’t have to do this,” she says. Ellie responds, “I already did.” It’s not bravado—it’s resignation. She believes revenge is the only thing left to give her meaning.

Beat 3: The next morning, Dina is too sick to move. Ellie leaves supplies beside her, gently kisses her forehead, and scribbles a note: “I’ll come back.”

Beat 4: Alone, Ellie walks through the husk of Seattle. She is a shadow, her movements quick, precise, her eyes always searching. She’s drawing closer to Lakehill hospital—and to Nora.

Beat 5: The episode ends as Ellie surveys the facility from a rooftop, her breath steady, her silhouette against the smog-drenched skyline. Below, WLF soldiers move like insects. The hunt continues. So does the transformation.
