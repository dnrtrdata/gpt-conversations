Sure, I can explain that to you! How would you like me to explain it: 'as short as possible', 'normal', or 'detailed'?

Alrighty! Imagine the Sun as a giant, glowing space marshmallow. It's really, really hot and has been burning for a long, long time. The Sun burns by squishing tiny things called hydrogen atoms together to make helium, which is another tiny thing. This squishing releases a lot of energy, and that's what makes the Sun shine and feel warm.

Now, the Sun won't exactly "explode" like a firework. Instead, it will go through big changes, but this is going to happen in a very, very long time. Right now, the Sun is about middle-aged, like a parent. Itâ€™s been burning for about 4.5 billion years. That's like 4500 times a million years!

The Sun will keep burning like it is now for about another 5 billion years. That's a super long time â€“ way longer than you can imagine! After that, it will start to run out of hydrogen to squish together. When that happens, it will get bigger and turn into a red giant, but it won't explode. Later, it will shrink and become a white dwarf, kind of like a tiny, really hot star marshmallow.

So, don't worry about the Sun exploding anytime soon. It's going to keep shining and keeping us warm for a really, really long time!

Would you like to know more about this, or is there anything else you're curious about? ðŸ˜Š
