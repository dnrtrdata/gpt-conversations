Prepared guitar: a list of techniques
This list may be useful to think not only about how guitarists and other musicians [bassists, pianists, violinists] can generate a wide pallette of sound- but also to consider how/where on an instrument a sensor system might be placed. quoted from this source: http://ihatemusic.noquam.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=5858
____________________________
PREPARED GUITAR TECHNIQUES
1.Techniques for preparing the strings directly
-Objects can be attached directly to strings (paperclips, rubber bands, alligator clips), woven through two or more adjacent strings, or placed between the strings and the neck/body creating a “false bridge”. When an object is woven between strings or resting unsecured on adjacent strings, rattling effects and accidental note soundings may occur
-Continuum of preparation objects concerning sound quality-
-Brightest, most resonant, most sustain
Dense, heavy, metal preparations (Alligator clips, Metal utensils, coins, etc.) Less dense, light, metal preparations (paperclips, foil, wire, springs etc.) Stone preparations
-Less bright, more percussive, less resonant, less sustain
Wooden preparations (clothespins, wood blocks, pencils, toothpicks) Plastic preparations (credit cards, pens, straws, plastic utensils)
-Dark sounding, very percussive, little harmonic content, little sustain
Cloth objects Rubber objects (erasers and so on) Leather objects Paper/cardboard objects Styrofoam objects
-As preparation objects become less dense and lighter (moving down the scale), greater lengths of string in contact with the preparation object will cause the resulting sound to be more percussive and less defined harmonically (for instance, plastic cup lids create a more percussive and less sustaining sound compared to straws woven horizontally across the strings)
-Free-floating preparations will be more resonant and have more sustain generally than those placed under the strings or between the strings and body
-The position of the preparation relative to the pickups determines which part of the sounding string is amplified; preparations placed between two amplified pickups may cause the pickups to amplify both sides of the string equally.
-The position of the preparation relative to the nodal points of the string determine which overtones will be emphasized
-Contact mics can be fastened to the preparation itself
2.Techniques for exciting the strings directly
-Monitor/amp feedback
-Ebow strings on normal playing area
-Ebow strings above nut, behind bridge, false bridge, or preparation
-Tapped harmonics over nodal points on fretboard
-False harmonics (touch and pluck at node)
-Tapping object on instrument body, hardware, or table to excite strings (high gain helps)
-Tapping object or fingers on strings themselves (on normal playing area or behind bridge, false bridge, or preparation)
-Tapping or plucking fretted notes behind preparation or false bridge
-Using movement of pickup switch to set strings vibrating (high gain helps)
-Using electric fan to excite the strings (no contact)
-Using electric fan or other motor to directly contact and excite strings (moving parts contact/bow string)
-Using vibrating mechanism to excite strings through direct contact, contact with strings outside of normal playing area, contact with body, or contact with table to create sympathetic string vibrations (assuming one is using tabletop guitar)
-Tapping/strumming/plucking the preparations on string a. strum business card woven in strings or excite with motor b. tap free-floating alligator clip attached to string to set string vibrating, muting strings on either side of preparation as desired c. allow string vibration to cause non-free-floating clips to rattle/sound notes on adjacent strings d. Ruler/file/other preparation woven in strings can be struck and allowed to vibrate, creating rattling on adjacent strings e. Spring or other preparation with its own vibrating frequency can be woven through strings and struck/strummed/excited, sending object’s fundamental vibration as well as string’s sound through the pickups
-Traditional Bowing a. Bowing the strings themselves in the normal playing area, closer to nut or bridge to bring out harmonics, farther away for stronger fundamental b. Bowing the strings above the nut or behind the bridge (or a false bridge or preparation on string) c. Bowing the body directly, the hardware, or the preparations directly
-Plastic knife or file used to bow/saw strings (normal playing area, behind bridge, false bridge, or preparation) – Detuning or muting for rattling non-tonal textural sound or allowing strings to sound normally for harmonics/overtones
-A length of cloth or other material (such as magnetic tape) can be woven through the strings and used as a ‘bow’
-Slide or other metal object, plastic object, or wood can be used to bow/saw strings horizontally across the strings to excite fretted notes or stop the string and excite notes themselves (following normal continuum of sound quality regarding preparation materials with plastic, paper and wood creating a drier, less harmonic sound and denser materials creating a more resonant overtone-rich sound)
-Objects can be moved vertically along strings to create scraping sounds/excite harmonics/sound fretted notes
– normal-type bowing (roughly perpendicular to strings) with: rosined wood rusty metal rods stretched rubber sidewalk chalk
– longitudinal bowing on unwound strings a la Ellen Fullman, Brett Larner using… rubber, rosined objects, hands
-Using the sympathetic vibrations caused by nearby metal objects to excite strings without contacting them (tuning forks, bells). This can also be done with the voice or by a number of other methods; the purpose is to use these source sounds to trigger vibrations in the strings rather than amplify the source sounds themselves, which should remain unheard. Different overtones can be emphasized depending on the position of the sound source along the string length.
-When a preparation contacts two or more strings, one can strike the adjacent string (muted or outside of the normal playing area) to set a string vibrating, changing the character of the attack and possibly adding sympathetic vibrations from the struck string to the overtones of the second string
-A loudspeaker placed in proximity to the strings can be used to excite the strings, while the pickups amplify only the strings sympathetic vibrations and not the original signal from the loudspeakers (assuming the speaker is sufficiently far away from the pickups)
-An object woven through the strings can be bowed or excited with a fan/ebow/other device. Creates a similar sound to exciting the strings directly but with a diminished attack
3.Interacting with the body of the instrument and non-electronic hardware (tuners, bridge, etc) directly to create sounds
-Tapping on the body, hardware, tremolo springs, or pickguard with fingers or objects, audible directly through the pickups because of microphonics or sympathetic vibrations on the muted strings – the continuum of preparation materials also has an effect here (striking the body with a coin produces a sharper, harder sound than striking it with a cloth-covered mallet)
-Using a traditional bow, electric fans, or motors on the body of the instrument, the bridge, or the tremolo springs
4.Interacting with the pickups and wiring system directly
-Devices with electric motors can be used to interact magnetically with the pickups if held in close enough proximity to them (Cassette players, CD players, Handheld fans, Vibrating mechanisms)
-The terminals of a battery can be touched to the hardware/strings/pickups, in some instances the current may make interesting sounds beyond what one would normally get by preparing with standard metal objects…
-Some other electronic devices which transmit radiation will cause interference or static when placed in close proximity to the pickups (Remote controls, Cell phones, Fluorescent lights)
-Electronic devices with a speaker will be amplified by the pickups if placed in close proximity to them (Shortwave radios, Walkmen/Discman/MD through headphones Any speakers or headphones monitoring the guitar signal will create microphonic feedback)
-Depending on the quality and characteristics of the pickups and volume and tone knobs, certain settings of the pickup selector or knobs may produce 60 cycle hum or audible interference which can be utilized
-Metal objects such as steel wool can contact the pickups directly; sounds can be made through the contact between the two (metal contacting the pickup magnets) or by manipulating/exciting the metal object in contact with the pickup to further explore the sound qualities of the object
-Touching a string or metal hardware when the instrument is not otherwise grounded can cause crackling or static effects
-Using a resonant metal object (bells, tuning forks) over the pickups to amplify the sound of the objects themselves rather than manipulate or excite the strings

User:


Now I want all the techniques in our list described in exhaustive, granular detail. Each technique should include a) thorough instructions describing how to perform each respective technique; and b) each respective technique’s desired effect.

Start with just the entries under Level 1 (including A1, A2, and A3).
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Level 1: Basic String Preparation & Excitation

(These techniques require minimal setup and offer immediate sonic alterations. They focus on modifying the string’s natural vibration, altering resonance, sustain, and harmonic content.)

A1: Attaching Objects to Strings

(Inserting or resting objects on the strings to modify vibration, tone, and sustain.)

1. Clipping Paperclips, Rubber Bands, or Alligator Clips onto Strings
Instructions:

Select a small metallic or rubber object (e.g., paperclip, rubber band, alligator clip).

For paperclips, attach them by sliding one loop over a string near the bridge or nut. Adjust placement for different effects.

For rubber bands, wrap them around multiple strings, either near the bridge or woven through.

For alligator clips, clamp them directly onto the string at various points. Experiment with clipping near the bridge, middle of the string, or over the pickups.

Effect:

Paperclips & Alligator Clips: Create a bright, metallic buzz and shorten sustain. When placed near a pickup, they emphasize overtones. If clipped at different points, they can dampen or enhance harmonic nodes.

Rubber Bands: Produce a muted, percussive effect, eliminating most harmonic resonance and sustain. The elasticity can create a loose, rattling buzz when plucked.

2. Weaving Straws, Rulers, or Business Cards Through Multiple Strings
Instructions:

Take a straw, ruler, or business card and slide it horizontally between two or more adjacent strings.

For a woven effect, thread the object over one string and under the next, repeating across the fretboard.

Positioning closer to the bridge allows for more resonance, while positioning closer to the nut or middle of the string dampens sustain.

Experiment with different materials: plastic straws provide a sharper sound, while wooden rulers or thicker cardboard create a more percussive and muffled effect.

Effect:

Creates a buzzing, rattling sound when plucked. The woven object vibrates against the strings, producing a mechanical, percussive effect.

Muting sustain, altering pitch, and modifying the timbre based on material and placement.

Strumming all six strings with a woven material inserted can mimic prepared piano effects.

3. Resting Metal Objects (Coins, Utensils) on Strings as Free-Floating Preparations
Instructions:

Place a coin, metal fork, or small metallic item directly onto the strings, resting lightly between the nut and bridge.

The object should remain unsecured, allowing it to rattle when the string vibrates.

Test different placements: closer to the bridge for sharper, brighter resonance, closer to the nut for a more muted effect.

Strumming or picking the string will cause the object to move slightly, affecting sound unpredictably.

Effect:

Produces metallic, bell-like overtones with a rattling decay.

Unsecured objects introduce chaotic resonance, affecting each note differently.

If the object is allowed to bounce, it creates an unstable tremolo-like modulation in tone.

A2: Plucking & Tapping Strings

(Physically interacting with the strings to create distinct tonal and percussive effects.)

1. Plucking Strings Behind a False Bridge or Preparation
Instructions:

If a preparation (clip, ruler, rubber band) is in place, pluck the string behind it (closer to the nut or bridge).

Alternatively, play in restricted areas of the guitar, such as behind the bridge (on guitars with floating bridges) or above the nut (on headstocks with long string overhangs).

Use fingerpicking, a pick, or even an Ebow to excite the restricted portion of the string.

Effect:

Produces a high-pitched, metallic harmonic rather than a typical note.

If the preparation creates a false bridge, the resulting pitch is often higher and inharmonic compared to normal plucking.

Creates a harpsichord-like articulation when combined with certain materials.

2. Tapping Strings with Fingers or Simple Objects (Pencil, Pick)
Instructions:

Tap a finger, guitar pick, or small hard object (e.g., pencil, pen) directly onto a string rather than plucking it.

The tapping hand should strike the string firmly and quickly, allowing it to rebound without muting the sound.

Experiment with tapping over frets (to generate harmonics) versus between frets (for percussive bass-like notes).

Increase gain/distortion to amplify softer tapped articulations.

Effect:

Produces a sharp, percussive attack instead of a ringing note.

When tapped over specific fret positions (e.g., 5th, 7th, 12th fret), it emphasizes harmonics rather than the fundamental pitch.

If tapping near the bridge pickup, the note will have more treble and clarity; near the neck pickup, the tone is rounder and softer.

3. Using a Pickup Switch to Excite Strings Without Direct Contact
Instructions:

Set the guitar to a high-gain distortion setting.

Rapidly flip the pickup selector switch between two active pickups.

As you do this, lightly touch the strings (without plucking) to introduce subtle sympathetic vibrations.

Experiment with different switch positions to alter tone and effect duration.

Effect:

Generates stuttering, glitchy tones without direct plucking.

Excites the strings via electromagnetic interference rather than mechanical movement.

Works especially well on guitars with hot pickups (e.g., active pickups, single-coil high-gain configurations).

A3: Striking Prepared Objects

(Utilizing attached or placed objects to alter the attack, resonance, and percussive qualities of the strings.)

1. Tapping Alligator Clips or Rulers Woven Through Strings
Instructions:

After placing an alligator clip, ruler, or similar preparation onto the strings (see A1), tap the object directly using a finger, pick, or another small hard item.

If using a ruler or other long preparation, strike one end and let it vibrate freely.

Test with different levels of force—soft taps for subtle rattling, harder taps for more pronounced buzzing.

Effect:

Creates a short, sharp percussive hit with a metallic or wooden resonance depending on material.

Causes sympathetic vibrations in the prepared string, altering tone unpredictably.

If tapped forcefully, the object may bounce, creating a tremolo-like fluttering effect.

2. Strumming Business Cards or Plastic Strips Woven into Strings
Instructions:

Take a business card, plastic lid, or stiff paper strip and weave it through three or more adjacent strings.

Strum across all prepared strings using a pick or fingers.

Adjust the card’s positioning for different levels of resistance—tighter weaving for muted percussion, looser weaving for buzzing resonance.

Effect:

Produces a snare drum-like rattling when strummed.

Mutes some notes while allowing others to resonate unpredictably.

Creates a mechanical, chattering sound reminiscent of old typewriters or prepared pianos.

3. Striking Springs or Metal Bars Resting on Strings
Instructions:

Place a small metal spring, tuning fork, or thin bar onto the strings.

Strike it lightly with a pick, finger, or another object to set both the spring and the string into motion.

Adjust pressure—fully resting the object dampens sustain, allowing it to vibrate freely enhances resonance.

Effect:

Generates ringing metallic overtones with variable sustain.

If struck near the bridge, it emphasizes upper harmonics; near the middle of the string, it produces deeper, more resonant tones.

I’m ready for level 2.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Level 2: Intermediate Techniques with Physical Interaction

(These techniques require more precision, coordination, or external tools to execute effectively. They significantly alter the guitar’s resonance, harmonic structure, and attack.)

B1: Bowing & Friction-Based Excitation

(Using continuous friction to sustain or manipulate the string's resonance.)

1. Bowing Strings with a Violin Bow (Rosined Horsehair or Synthetic Bow)
Instructions:

Apply violin, cello, or bass rosin to the bow hair to increase friction.

Hold the bow perpendicular to the guitar strings (similar to a violin technique).

Use slow, steady pressure to draw the bow across a single string, typically between the pickups or over the fretboard.

Experiment with different bowing speeds—slower strokes create a deep, haunting sustain, while faster strokes add a raspy texture.

Adjust attack angle to emphasize harmonics or the fundamental note.

Effect:

Produces a continuous, eerie, cello-like sustain.

Slow bowing emphasizes deep, rich fundamentals; fast bowing introduces scratchy, noisy overtones.

Works best on flatwound or smooth-wound strings (roundwounds create excessive friction noise).

2. Using a Handheld Motorized Device (Ebow, Electric Toothbrush) for Infinite Sustain
Instructions:

Position an Ebow directly over a string, allowing its electromagnetic field to vibrate the string continuously.

Move the Ebow closer to the bridge for brighter tones and closer to the neck for warmer, flute-like sustain.

If using an electric toothbrush or small motorized device, place the vibrating end lightly against the string to excite it.

Experiment with multiple strings to create droning, layered textures.

Effect:

Creates sustained, violin-like tones with zero attack.

Produces gradual volume swells, making the notes fade in and out smoothly.

When moved over harmonic nodes, the Ebow accentuates natural harmonics, leading to ghostly overtones.

3. Rubbing a Moistened Finger or Cloth Along the String for Bowed Harmonics
Instructions:

Lightly moisten your fingertip with water or rosin.

Gently press and slide your finger along a string’s length (between pickups or on the fretboard).

Apply consistent, firm pressure while moving slowly to sustain the vibration.

Experiment with different string tensions and locations to emphasize overtones.

Effect:

Generates high-pitched, eerie harmonic resonances.

If done correctly, it mimics a bowed glass or theremin-like effect.

Works best on unwound strings (plain steel strings respond better than wound bass strings).

B2: Harmonic Excitation & Manipulation

(Techniques that emphasize harmonics, creating bell-like chimes or altered resonance.)

1. Pinching Natural Harmonics While Plucking
Instructions:

Lightly touch the string with the picking-hand thumb immediately after plucking a note.

The contact should be brief—just enough to emphasize the harmonic while allowing the note to sustain.

Works best on nodal points (12th, 7th, and 5th frets) but can be experimented with on other positions for less predictable harmonics.

Effect:

Produces a bell-like chime instead of a full-bodied note.

Alters the timbre, emphasizing the upper overtone series rather than the fundamental.

Sounds brighter and sharper with distortion.

2. Creating Artificial Harmonics with a Tapped Finger
Instructions:

Fret a note with your fretting hand.

Using a single finger from your picking hand, lightly tap exactly 12 frets above the fretted note.

The tapping motion should be quick and precise, barely touching the string before releasing.

Works best when combined with high-gain or compression.

Effect:

Produces glass-like, high-pitched harmonics with a piano-like attack.

Allows you to create harmonics anywhere on the neck, even where natural harmonics don’t normally occur.

3. Plucking with the Side of a Pick for Squealing Harmonics
Instructions:

Hold the pick so that the rounded edge or side makes contact with the string rather than the tip.

Strike the string at an angle, allowing the pick’s surface to brush against the vibrating string.

Works best when played near the bridge pickup for enhanced harmonic response.

Effect:

Produces high-pitched, squealing harmonics when played with distortion.

The sound is often unpredictable, with different harmonic nodes being activated based on pick angle and pressure.

B3: Percussive & Damping Techniques

(Techniques that introduce rhythmic articulation and damping effects, altering the attack and sustain of notes.)

1. Slapping & Palm Thumping for Drumming Effects
Instructions:

Use the side of your palm to lightly slap the guitar strings near the bridge.

Alternatively, use the fingertips or side of the thumb to strike the strings with a percussive motion.

Experiment with different hand positions to control the amount of damping.

Effect:

Mimics the attack of a drum or hand percussion, great for rhythmic playing.

Completely eliminates sustain when played aggressively.

Adds a punchy, muted attack to notes when integrated with normal plucking.

2. Muting the Strings with Fabric or Foam for a Deadened Sound
Instructions:

Place a small piece of fabric, sponge, or foam under the strings near the bridge.

Adjust the amount of pressure—the more the material contacts the strings, the more muted the sound.

Works well with slap bass-style techniques or rhythmic chording.

Effect:

Reduces sustain dramatically, making notes sound short and percussive.

Creates a warm, jazzy thump reminiscent of a muted upright bass.

Works well for lo-fi textures and vintage-style recording techniques.

3. Finger Flicking the Strings for Harp-Like Attack
Instructions:

Hold your hand above the strings with a loose wrist.

Use a finger (middle or ring finger works best) to flick downward across the strings quickly.

This should be done with a snapping motion, allowing the string to slap against the fretboard.

Effect:

Creates sharp, bright plucks similar to a harpsichord.

The attack is aggressive, producing a crisp, percussive resonance.

Can be used rhythmically in fast passages for harp-like cascades.

That covers Level 2 techniques! Let me know if you're ready for Level 3, which will introduce advanced preparations, mechanical interference, and multi-string manipulations.

Level 3: Advanced Techniques with Mechanical or Multi-String Interaction

(These techniques require more precision, external objects, or unconventional approaches to manipulate the guitar’s sound. They drastically alter the instrument’s resonance, sustain, and tonal qualities.)

C1: Multi-String Preparations & Altered Resonance

(Techniques that involve placing objects on or weaving them through multiple strings to create new resonant characteristics.)

1. Weaving an Object Through Two or More Strings for Rattling Effects
Instructions:

Insert a paperclip, rubber band, or thin wooden dowel between at least two adjacent strings.

The object should rest freely but snugly, allowing it to rattle slightly when the strings vibrate.

Adjust the object’s position—closer to the bridge produces a crisper, more percussive sound, while closer to the fretboard yields a duller, more muted resonance.

Effect:

Produces a rattling, buzzing effect similar to a sitar or prepared piano.

Alters the sustain of notes, often introducing chaotic overtones.

Can create an unstable, droning quality when strumming multiple prepared strings.

2. Using a Free-Floating Clip or Metal Object on a String for Sympathetic Vibrations
Instructions:

Attach a small alligator clip, binder clip, or lightweight metal object to a single string.

Ensure the object is not fixed tightly, allowing it to vibrate independently when the string is played.

Adjust placement near different harmonics (12th, 7th, or 5th frets) to emphasize different overtones.

Effect:

Creates metallic, unpredictable resonances as the object vibrates along with the string.

The attack can become percussive, while the sustain takes on a mechanical, droning character.

On high-gain settings, the object’s movement can cause random harmonic overtones, leading to a more chaotic, industrial sound.

3. Placing a False Bridge (Credit Card, Wooden Slat) Under the Strings for Divided Resonance
Instructions:

Insert a flat object (such as a credit card, ruler, or wooden slat) under the strings, pressing them against the frets or body.

The object should not fully mute the strings but rather create two separate vibrating segments.

Experiment with placement—closer to the bridge increases the brightness, while closer to the nut softens the resonance.

Effect:

Divides each string into two separate vibrating lengths, creating an effect similar to a kalimba or zither.

The divided strings produce unexpected harmonic overtones based on the false bridge’s location.

Strumming across all strings yields a clanging, detuned bell-like effect.

C2: Bowing & Sustained Excitation of Strings with Objects

(Techniques that involve using unconventional bowing and excitation methods to create continuous, harmonic-rich sounds.)

1. Using a Plastic Knife, File, or Other Rigid Object as a Bow
Instructions:

Hold a plastic knife, metal file, or thin wooden slat at a slight angle to the strings.

Use a sawing motion across the strings, moving slowly to maintain friction.

Increase pressure for a harsh, scraping sound or reduce pressure for a smoother, bowed effect.

Effect:

Creates a nasal, metallic sustain, similar to a bowed cymbal or sheet metal.

Slower motions produce drone-like textures, while fast sawing yields a scraping, atonal effect.

Works well with delay and reverb effects to create eerie, sustained pads.

2. Bowing the Body, Bridge, or Hardware Instead of the Strings
Instructions:

Instead of bowing the strings, apply a rosined violin bow to the guitar’s body, bridge, or tremolo springs.

Maintain even, slow pressure while bowing to excite resonant frequencies.

Adjust bow placement for different effects—closer to the bridge increases metallic overtones, while the body produces deeper resonances.

Effect:

Creates deep, resonant drones as the body amplifies the bow’s vibrations.

Exciting the bridge or tremolo springs introduces mechanical, reverb-like overtones.

Works particularly well with hollow-body or semi-hollow guitars due to their acoustic properties.

3. Scraping an Object Along the Strings for Continuous Harmonics
Instructions:

Take a metal rod, file, or wooden dowel and press it against the strings at a shallow angle.

Move the object lengthwise along the strings to create continuous scraping.

Apply different levels of pressure—light pressure emphasizes harmonics, while heavier pressure produces an aggressive, grinding noise.

Effect:

Generates sustained, high-pitched harmonic clusters.

When combined with distortion, it creates industrial, metallic textures.

Fast movement can mimic the effect of wind or sustained electronic noise.

C3: Interaction with Electronics & Magnetic Interference

(Techniques that involve manipulating the guitar’s pickups, wiring, or external electromagnetic fields to generate noise-based effects.)

1. Introducing Electromagnetic Interference with Small Electronic Devices
Instructions:

Bring a handheld fan, cassette player, or small speaker

ChatGPT:


close to the guitar’s pickups while they are active.

Move the device slowly toward and away from the pickups to hear variations in the interference.

Rotate or tilt the device to change how its electromagnetic field interacts with the guitar’s signal.

Effect:

Creates buzzing, whirring, or pulsing static depending on the device.

Some devices (like cell phones or shortwave radios) can introduce glitch-like noises or rhythmic interference patterns.

Works well in experimental noise music or as a layer for atmospheric soundscapes.

2. Using a Battery to Directly Interact with Pickups or Strings
Instructions:

Hold a 9V battery and touch its terminals to the strings, pickups, or bridge.

Move the battery around to hear changes in the electrical response.

Be cautious to avoid strong surges that could damage the guitar’s electronics.

Effect:

Can produce crackling, static-like sounds as the electrical current interacts with the pickups.

Momentary contact can create pulsing or glitchy bursts of noise.

Works well in lo-fi, noise, and experimental guitar textures.

3. Touching an Un-Grounded String or Metal Hardware to Introduce Static & Hum
Instructions:

If the guitar’s electronics are not properly grounded, simply touch a metal part of the guitar (strings, bridge, or tuning pegs) while plugged in.

Use different amounts of pressure or tap the metal parts lightly to create variations in the static noise.

Adjust the volume and tone knobs to increase or decrease the hum’s presence.

Effect:

Produces low-frequency hum, crackles, and bursts of static.

Can be manipulated for controlled bursts of noise in an improvisational context.

Works well when combined with delay, reverb, or distortion pedals for added texture.

This completes Level 3, which involves more advanced preparation techniques, bowing mechanics, and direct electronic interactions. Let me know when you're ready for Level 4!

25+ Guitar Techniques You Should Learn Now
Kernix2020-10-22
￼
As a beginner guitar player, you probably begin playing simple chord progressions of songs you know and like. But at some point, beginners want to learn how to solo and play lead guitar. That leads to learning scales and arpeggios as the next thing to learn. But it is the mastering of guitar techniques, not scales, that can make your playing shine. This article list 25 important guitar techniques that every guitar player should know.
25+ Guitar techniques
Check out the guitar techniques section of my Music Symbols article where I have more to say on the following guitar techniques. Expect to see articles in the upcoming months on every technique listed and more in-depth coverage of each technique and embellishment for guitarists.
Single, double, & multi-note embellishments
There are only two guitar techniques that involve a single note:
	1	Tremolo: rapid repetition of a single note.
	2	Vibrato: a slight back and forth string bend.
Here are 8 two-note techniques:
	1	Hammer-On: Played by striking a note and then hammering onto a higher-pitched note to sound the second note.
	2	Pull-Off: is when you play one note and then pull off to sound a second note.
	3	Trill: Similar to a tremolo but with two notes involving repeated hammer-ons and pull-offs.
	4	Mordent: This is a specific trill that involves a single sequence of a hammer-on and pull-off for the note above your principle note (upper mordent). A lower mordent involves a pull-off and then hammer on to and from the note below the target note. So a single HOPO or POHO.
	5	String Bends: when you pluck a note then push or pull the string to sound a higher pitch note.
	6	Slides (Portamento): tends to be a slow slide where you hear the individual notes between the first note and final note.
	7	Slides (Glissando): is a quicker slide than portamento where you do not hear the individual notes between the first and last note.
	8	Double-stops \ guitar dyads: This is basically playing 2 notes simultaneously or maybe individually if done in sequences or alternating simultaneous and individual picking  (intervals).
Here are 3 multi-note embellishments:
	1	Arpeggio: Playing a chord as single notes typically in the order of the chord construction, in thirds.
	2	Tapping: a hammer-on technique but where you use your picking hand to hammer-on any note on a string.
	3	Gruppetto \ Turn: This is a 4-note riff in the pattern of target note + upper neighboring note + lower neighboring note + target note. Or you could reverse the upper and lower notes. You can also opt to start with the neighboring note vs principle note.
Percussive guitar techniques
Use these techniques to add rhythmical interest to your playing.
	1	Ghost-Note: a dead note as the result of muting the string plucked.
	2	Palm Mute: using your palm to slightly mute the notes/strings being played.
	3	Rake: 2 or more dead or ghost notes before your target note.
	4	Pickscrape: scraping the pick on the wound strings, strings E thru G.
	5	Golpe: tapping the guitar body after playing a chord.
	6	Pop or Snap: pulling a string away from the body and letting it “snap” or “pop” back.
	7	Slap: Using the thumb or palm to slap the bass strings.
Miscellaneous embellishments
Here are some other guitar techniques that may interest you.
	1	Sustain: Allowing a note, interval, or chord to ring out for 2 or more measures. Think “feedback”.
	2	Rip: a fast lick of 32nd notes or faster.
	3	Sul ponticello: means to play the strings at or very near the bridge of the guitar.
	4	Sul tasto: this technique involves playing the strings over the fingerboard.
	5	Use of silence: By stopping all playing, it can have a strong effect when you start again. Contrast this technique with sustained notes.
Bonus: Distortions of tempo or meter – This is easier said than done, but you deliberately play phrases in contrast to the time signature and tempo. Try deliberately speeding up or slowing down but with a different emphasis of accented beats that the time signature indicates.
Final Thoughts
So I believe that is 26 guitar techniques but the last one is kind of advanced so you can leave that one off your list until you are ready for it. The one you want to work on mastering right away is vibrato. That one technique really helped me “figure out” playing lead guitar.
