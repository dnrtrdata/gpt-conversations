TREATMENT: SEQUENCE 1 – SETUP (Scenes 1–6)

Purpose: Establish Maia’s structured life, familial tensions, and the creeping threat of the Blenders. Slow-burn ecological dread and character dynamics dominate, with beats escalating from 2–3 per scene. The Catalyst (Scene 6) forces irreversible engagement with the threat.

SCENE 1 – Ripples in Routine (Pages 1–2, 3 Beats)

Morning. A quiet coastline. The tide breathes in and out, unbothered. Inside a small beachside home, MAIA HOLLOWAY (19) moves with measured precision.

Maia’s disciplined morning routine – Wake at dawn. Make the bed with military neatness. Her walls are adorned with swim meet ribbons and a rigid schedule taped near her mirror. Every movement—pulling on her running shoes, timing her stretches—is methodical.

Radio report on aggressive marine life – In the kitchen, she flips on the local station. A reporter mentions erratic marine behavior—jellyfish clustering near the shore, dolphins found stranded. Maia listens without reaction, focused on blending her protein shake.

Shadow in water during swim practice – At the public pool, Maia’s strokes slice through the still morning water. As she exhales, a dark shape flickers beneath her. She halts, staring. Nothing. The lifeguard’s radio crackles. She shakes off the unease and keeps swimming.

Pacing Note: Slow, atmospheric tension. Lingering shots of still water. Sound design emphasizes emptiness.

SCENE 2 – Fractures at Home (Pages 3–4, 2 Beats)

Maia covers for Derek’s neglect – At home, her father, JAMES (50s, perpetually preoccupied), sighs at an unpaid bill on the counter. “Derek was supposed to handle this.” MAIA, already moving, grabs the checkbook. “I’ll do it.” She’s used to picking up the slack.

Noah’s casual wave (bonding seed) – Outside, NOAH (19, easygoing, old swim rival turned maybe-friend) bikes past. He waves, a small moment of warmth in Maia’s rigid day. She half-smiles back.

Pacing Note: Contrast Maia’s exhaustion with Noah’s lightness. The world moves at a different speed than her.

SCENE 3 – Weaknesses and Watchfulness (Pages 5–6, 3 Beats)

James critiques Maia’s avoidance – James drops a pile of college brochures in front of her. “You need a plan beyond holding everything together here.” Maia stiffens. “I have a plan.” They talk past each other.

“Face weaknesses” theme stated – James’s parting words: “Running from your weaknesses isn’t the same as being strong.” Maia ignores it, but it sticks.

Noah’s subtle encouragement – Later, at the swim center, Noah nudges her. “You ever think about getting back into open water?” Maia brushes it off, but his question lingers.

Pacing Note: Character-driven tension. The Blenders remain unseen, but the undercurrents of change build.

SCENE 4 – Small Victories, Looming Dread (Pages 7–8, 2 Beats)

Maia impresses at work – At her lifeguarding shift, Maia reacts quickly to a floundering child. Parents whisper about her speed and control. A rare moment of validation.

Customer mentions disappearances – An elderly beachgoer chats with her as she checks the shoreline. “Used to be the water gave things back. Lately, it just takes.” A harmless old-timer’s rambling—or something more?

Pacing Note: Subtle dread woven under a moment of triumph.

SCENE 5 – The First Glimpse (Pages 9–10, 3 Beats)

Fisherman’s bait attracts Blender – Down at the pier, a fisherman mutters about losing all his bait to something “sneaky.” He re-baits his hook, unaware of the movement below.

Pier cracks during BURST attack – A deep crack in the wood. A sudden suction, like the water itself inhaling. The fisherman stumbles back, cursing.

Maia witnesses aftermath – She arrives just as he’s pulling up his empty line. Nearby, a single fish floats belly-up—its body marked with strange, symmetrical scars.

Pacing Note: The first partial reveal. Sound and minor details create tension without fully exposing the threat.

SCENE 6 – The Catalyst (Pages 11–12, 3 Beats)

Maia’s sunset decompression – At dusk, Maia sits on the sand, watching the sun stain the sky. For a moment, she lets herself breathe.

Whirlpools/hum escalate – The gentle waves shift. A low hum trembles through the air. Swirls form in the water—tight, unnatural spirals.

Blender BURST near shore – Then it happens. A violent burst—the water implodes, then explodes upward. Maia scrambles back, breath catching. The ocean stills, too quickly. The unnatural silence lingers, pressing against her chest.

Pacing Note: A personal close call forces Maia into awareness. The unseen becomes undeniable.

NEXT: SEQUENCE 2 – DEBATE (Scenes 7–12)

Maia wrestles with the truth as the town dismisses the warning signs. Can she step up before it’s too late?

TREATMENT: SEQUENCE 2 – DEBATE (Scenes 7–12)

Purpose: Explore Maia’s reluctance to lead and the community’s denial of the threat. Beats (2–3 per scene) balance human conflict and escalating Blender activity. The Break Into Two (Scene 12) commits Maia to confronting the danger.

SCENE 7 – Willful Ignorance (Pages 13–14, 2 Beats)

Derek downplays disappearances – At breakfast, the news reports another missing fisherman. DEREK (24, Maia’s older brother, detached, reckless) dismisses it. “People go missing in the ocean all the time.” Maia shoots him a glare. “That’s not normal.” But he’s already scrolling his phone, unmoved.

James urges vigilance – Their father, JAMES, leans forward, voice low. “Maybe not, but we stay sharp. The ocean’s changing.” His serious tone unsettles Maia. James rarely acknowledges fear.

Pacing Note: The news broadcast amplifies the dread. Maia is pulled between two influences—Derek’s apathy and James’ wariness.

SCENE 8 – Cracks in the Ecosystem (Pages 15–16, 3 Beats)

Fishpond damage revealed – At a community fishpond, elderly caretakers shake their heads. Dead fish litter the surface, some grotesquely twisted. The wooden enclosure is splintered—not from the tide. Maia kneels, running a hand along the fractures. Too precise. Too deliberate.

James’ “leadership” critique – Watching her assess the damage, James mutters, “You see it, don’t you? But you won’t say it.” Maia exhales sharply. “Say what?” He shrugs, knowingly. “What needs to be said.”

Maia’s quiet defiance – Instead of answering, Maia stands and walks away. But she grips her fists tightly, knuckles white.

Pacing Note: The destruction hints at the Blenders’ growing presence. Maia resists stepping up, but James sees the leader in her.

SCENE 9 – A Moment of Normalcy (Pages 17–18, 2 Beats)

Basketball court interaction – At an outdoor court, NOAH playfully spins a ball on his finger as Maia watches. “You ever play?” She shakes her head. “Strictly water sports.” He tosses her the ball anyway. She catches it, surprised.

“Superheroes need breaks” line – As they shoot around, Noah grins. “You should relax. Even superheroes need breaks.” She scoffs. “I’m not a superhero.” But the way he looks at her—like she’s capable of anything—makes her pause.

Pacing Note: A brief respite, deepening Noah and Maia’s connection. The looming horror feels distant—until it doesn’t.

SCENE 10 – Terror at Kalama Beach (Pages 19–20, 3 Beats)

Crowd panic at Kalama Beach – Late afternoon. A perfect beach day—until the tide pulls back suddenly. A gaping silence before screams. Something unseen churns beneath the waves. People scramble.

Maia saves children – Two young kids are too slow, frozen in terror. Without thinking, Maia sprints into the shallows. The suction nearly yanks her off balance. She grabs the kids and pushes toward shore just as a massive whirlpool forms behind them.

Noah’s silent admiration – As Maia catches her breath, drenched and shaking, she looks up to find Noah watching. Not joking, not teasing—just watching. He saw what she did. And maybe, for the first time, she lets herself see it too.

Pacing Note: Maia’s first real leadership moment. Tight framing on her decision-making and reactions intensifies the scene.

SCENE 11 – The Lost Return (Pages 21–22, 3 Beats)

Maureen’s shocking return – That night, an emergency at the docks. MAUREEN (40s, weathered, presumed lost at sea for days) stumbles ashore, soaking wet, vacant-eyed. People whisper, calling her name, but she barely registers them.

Deflective dialogue – When asked where she’s been, Maureen only mutters, “The water’s wrong.” She refuses to say more, flinching from touch.

Maia’s explosive anger – Watching the crowd gawk instead of act, Maia snaps. “What’s wrong with you people?! We need to do something!” The words burst out before she can stop them. Silence follows.

Pacing Note: A raw emotional beat—no score, just Maia’s voice cutting through the night air. The weight of responsibility starts pressing down.

SCENE 12 – The Decision (Pages 23–24, 3 Beats)

Derek’s apathy vs. James’ plea – At home, Derek slouches on the couch, unmoved. “What do you expect me to do? Board up the ocean?” James, frustrated, turns to Maia. “You saw what happened. We can’t keep pretending.”

Maia’s “Let’s go” resolve – Maia swallows hard. “Okay.” James blinks. “Okay?” Maia grabs a jacket. “Let’s go.” No hesitation. No looking back.

Camera lingers on Derek – As Maia and James leave, the camera holds on Derek—silent, unreadable. Then, the faintest hint of movement outside the window.

Pacing Note: The Break Into Two. Maia steps into leadership, but an ominous silence lingers—suggesting the Blenders are watching.

NEXT: SEQUENCE 3 – ESCALATION (Scenes 13–18)

With the threat undeniable, Maia must rally the town—even as the Blenders grow bolder.

Purpose: Deliver on the horror premise with escalating Blender attacks (3–4 beats per scene). Maia’s leadership is tested, relationships deepen, and the Midpoint (Scene 27) introduces the Alpha Blender as the apex predator.

SCENE 13 – The Tourist Incident (Pages 25–26, 3 Beats)

Tourist consumed in BURST – A clueless TOURIST (mid-40s, sunburned, selfie stick in hand) wades into the shallows despite warning signs. The water stills. A sudden, violent BURST—he’s gone. The sea rushes back as if nothing happened. Screams erupt.

Maia organizes evacuation – Maia pushes through the chaos, shouting orders: “Everyone OUT of the water, NOW!” She yanks a child away from the tide, her instincts sharper than ever.

Audience shock – Silence follows the last scream. The ocean is calm again. Tourists tremble. Locals stare, frozen. Maia exhales, pulse pounding. This is real.

Pacing Note: First full reveal—focus on speed, sound, and the wrongness of how quickly the ocean erases evidence.

SCENE 14 – Grease and Teeth (Pages 27–28, 3 Beats)

Grill chaos – At a popular beachside grill, workers struggle to keep up with orders. The oil in the fryer pops. Customers chatter. Everything feels normal.

Blender shreds grease trap – Then, a strange vibration rattles the outdoor seating. The ground beneath the grill buckles. A moment later, metal screeches. The grease trap, positioned over a drain leading to the ocean, collapses inward, yanked into the depths. Workers stumble back, staring at the jagged edges where steel was torn apart.

Maia’s confidence grows – Maia arrives, demanding, “What happened?” No one knows. But she does. Instead of fear, something shifts in her—she’s starting to anticipate them.

Pacing Note: Contrast horror with the mundane. A normal setting turns sinister in an instant.

SCENE 27 – The Alpha Emerges (Pages 53–54, 4 Beats – Midpoint)

Alpha’s vortex entrance – A massive swirl forms offshore—larger than anything before. The hum intensifies, vibrating the air. Maia and her group watch, spellbound. The vortex doesn’t dissipate. It grows.

BURST terrifies group – Without warning, it happens—a colossal BURST, sending water sky-high. The Alpha Blender emerges for the first time. Dark, sleek, its shape still obscured by mist and motion. But its presence is undeniable. The onlookers are pinned in place by sheer terror.

“We’re outmatched” realization – James, usually steady, murmurs, “That’s not normal.” Maia clenches her fists. “We’re outmatched.” A horrible truth settles in—they are dealing with something beyond understanding.

Stakes reset – The ocean settles, but nothing feels safe anymore. Maia looks at her team. “We have to change how we fight.” The next phase begins.

Pacing Note: Midpoint shift—wide shots emphasize the Alpha’s scale, while a deep, growing hum replaces the score. Everything before this was just practice.

NEXT: SEQUENCE 4 – BAD GUYS CLOSE IN (Scenes 28–36)

With the Alpha Blender now active, the town faces an impossible choice: fight back or flee? But the Blenders aren’t just attacking randomly—they’re learning.

Purpose: Shatter the group’s morale with coordinated Blender attacks (2–3 beats per scene). James’ sacrifice (Scene 36) becomes the All Is Lost moment, leaving Maia broken.

SCENE 28 – Something Below (Pages 55–56, 2 Beats)

Storm drain foreshadowing – Early morning. Maia walks past a grate-covered storm drain, the ocean visible through the gaps. A faint gurgle rises from below—not water, but something else. She hesitates, staring down into the dark.

Unease about strategy – Meeting with James and Noah, Maia outlines a plan to block underwater access points. But doubt lingers. “They’re not just attacking anymore,” James says. “They’re moving through the island.” They’re learning.

Pacing Note: Use low-angle shots of storm drains to create claustrophobia. The threat isn’t just in the ocean—it’s beneath them.

SCENE 36 – The Sacrifice (Pages 71–72, 4 Beats – All Is Lost Moment)

Alpha herds survivors – The group flees through a narrow flood tunnel, water lapping at their ankles. A deep hum vibrates the air. Then—movement. The Alpha Blender doesn’t attack. It steers them. Herding them exactly where it wants.

James’ distraction – A dead end. The Blenders close in. No way out. James grips Maia’s shoulder. “You keep them moving.” Maia shakes her head. “No.” But James is already stepping back. Making a choice.

Gruesome death – James lunges toward the water, drawing the Blenders’ attention. Chaos. A scream cut short. The water erupts, swallowing him whole. A slick of red taints the tide before the current erases it completely.

Maia’s guilt – Maia stares, chest heaving. The group pulls her away, but she doesn’t fight. James is gone. And she let it happen.

Pacing Note: Linger on James’ absence, not the gore. The horror is in the finality of it.

SCENE 37 – The Aftermath (Pages 73–74, 3 Beats)

Survivors blame Maia – The group huddles in a shelter, silent. Finally, someone speaks. “This is on you.” Maia flinches.

Derek’s silence – Maia turns to Derek. He doesn’t meet her eyes. He says nothing. And that hurts more than blame.

Alpha’s distant hum – Outside, the hum returns. A slow, steady vibration in the air. The Alpha is still there. And it’s waiting.

Pacing Note: Minimal dialogue. Ambient sound amplifies despair. The Blenders don’t need to attack—they’ve already won.

NEXT: SEQUENCE 5 – BREAKING POINT (Scenes 38–45)

With James gone and the group fractured, Maia must decide: surrender, or fight the impossible? But the Blenders aren’t done yet—they want all of them.

SCENE 41 – The Breaking Point (Pages 81–82, 4 Beats – The Slap Scene)

“I’m not you” declaration – In a dimly lit shelter, Maia and MAUREEN sit across from each other. Maureen, eyes hollow, speaks in riddles—memories distorted by whatever happened in the water. “The ocean takes what it wants.” Maia snaps, voice shaking: “I’m not you. I won’t let it take me too.”

Slap – Maureen suddenly strikes Maia across the face. The crack of it is sharp, real. A gasp from the group. But Maureen’s eyes hold no anger—only recognition.

Maureen’s stunned silence – Maia doesn’t flinch. She meets Maureen’s gaze, unyielding. For the first time, Maureen sees her not as a girl, but as a leader.

Maia’s resolve – Maia exhales, jaw clenched. “We end this. Now.”

Pacing Note: Raw, handheld camerawork. No score—just the sharpness of breath, the flicker of candlelight, the tension in the silence.

SCENE 42 – The Decision (Pages 83–84, 3 Beats – Break Into Three)

Maia’s plan – Maia spreads out a hand-drawn map, tracing paths through the island’s drainage system. “We cut off their access. Force them into the open.” The determination theme subtly plays beneath her words.

Derek’s offer – Derek, for the first time, steps forward. “I’ll help.” His voice lacks his usual arrogance. He means it.

Noah’s loyalty – Noah claps Maia on the shoulder. “Ride or die, Holloway.” She almost smiles.

Pacing Note: The score returns subtly. The camera pulls back as Maia stands taller than before. The final battle is coming.

TREATMENT: SEQUENCE 6 – FINALE (Scenes 43–54)

Purpose: Climactic battle (3–4 beats per scene) resolves Blender threat and character arcs. The Final Image (Scene 54) shows Maia’s hardened resilience.

SCENE 47 – The Turning Point (Pages 93–94, 4 Beats)

Maia cornered – Deep within the island’s storm drainage tunnels, Maia finds herself cut off from the others. The walls tremble as the Alpha’s low hum reverberates through the structure. The water level rises. The exit is too far.

Noah’s desperate act – CRASH. Noah appears above, risking everything to reach her. He throws down a rope. “We’re getting out, now.” But the current surges, pulling Maia under.

Trust deepened – Noah doesn’t hesitate. He dives in, grabs Maia, and forces them both toward the surface. She fights it—she hates needing help—but he won’t let go.

Alpha distracted – Before the Alpha can strike, a distant explosion shakes the tunnels—Derek and the others have triggered the trap. The water shifts, drawing the Alpha’s focus elsewhere.

Pacing Note: Rapid cuts during Noah’s risk—his heartbeat pounding, muffled screams underwater. Silence before the explosion for maximum impact.

SCENE 54 – Final Image (Pages 107–108, 3 Beats)

Sunrise over ocean – The first light of dawn spills over the water. Still. Silent. The ocean breathes, slow and steady, as if recovering.

Rebuilding community – People work together—clearing wreckage, checking in on each other. The town endures. They survived.

Maia walks forward – Maia stands at the shoreline, eyes scanning the horizon. The tide rolls in, brushes her feet. For the first time, she doesn’t flinch. She steps forward, into the water—owning it.

Pacing Note: Mirror Scene 1’s structure—same location, same morning stillness, but Maia is changed. The Final Image is one of resilience.

THE END.
