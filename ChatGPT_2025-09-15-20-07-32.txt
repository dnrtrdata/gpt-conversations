Explain attention in a neural network like I'm five
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Alright! Imagine you have a big box of crayons. Each crayon is a different color. Now, suppose you're drawing a picture of a sunny day. You'll use the yellow crayon a lot for the sun, right? And maybe a bit of blue for the sky and green for the grass.

In this case, your picture is like a problem you want to solve with a neural network, and each crayon is a piece of information. In a neural network, there's something called "attention." Attention is like your brain deciding which crayon (or piece of information) is the most important to use at a time. So, for the sun, your brain tells you, "Use the yellow crayon more because it's really important for the sun!"

In the same way, in a neural network, attention helps the network focus on the most important pieces of information to solve a problem. It looks at all the information it has, just like all the crayons in your box, and decides which ones are the most important to pay attention to at that moment. This helps the neural network be really good at solving problems, just like how paying attention to using the yellow crayon helps you draw a great sunny day.
