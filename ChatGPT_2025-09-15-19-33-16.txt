Movement Mechanics

Titanfall 2: Implement levels that utilize advanced movement mechanics like wall running and teleporting. Use Blueprints to create dynamic, interactive environments.

Implementation: Unreal Engine’s Blueprints can be used to handle wall-running mechanics by detecting player proximity to walls and adjusting movement vectors accordingly. Teleportation can be scripted using trigger volumes and Blueprint functions to move the player instantly to predefined points.

Example: While swimming, players can encounter special underwater walls that allow for temporary "wall-swimming" to avoid obstacles. Teleportation nodes could be scattered throughout the level, acting as shortcuts or escape mechanisms.

Dying Light: Combine parkour with satisfying combat mechanics. Use Blueprints to handle parkour movements and combat interactions.

Implementation: Parkour elements can be added by scripting animations and collision detection to allow players to vault, slide, and swim swiftly around obstacles. Combat interactions can be integrated using Unreal’s melee combat system, modified for underwater scenarios.

Example: Players can leap over underwater rocks, swim through tight spaces, and engage in melee combat with underwater creatures or enemies using tridents or other weapons.

Spider-Man 2018 Remastered PC: Focus on smooth and responsive movement mechanics. Use Blueprints to handle character animations and movement controls.

Implementation: Smooth and responsive swimming mechanics can be achieved by refining player input handling and using physics-based movement with Blueprint scripting for fluid transitions between different swimming speeds and directions.

Example: The swimmer can perform quick turns, accelerate smoothly, and seamlessly transition between different swimming actions like diving, surface swimming, and sprinting underwater.

Simplicity

Portal: Utilize straightforward gameplay mechanics executed flawlessly. Use Blueprints to create intuitive puzzles that test logic and reactions.

Implementation: Simple yet challenging puzzles can be implemented using interactive Blueprint actors. These can include timed gates, switches that alter water currents, and collectable items that unlock paths.

Example: Players must navigate through mazes of underwater caves, using switches to open gates or redirect water flows to clear paths.

Life Is Strange: Introduce unique gameplay mechanics like time rewind. Use Blueprint scripting to implement and manage these mechanics.

Impractical: Implementing time rewind in an infinite swimmer game may complicate the core mechanics and disrupt the game's flow.

Mark of the Ninja: Design stealth mechanics that feel intuitive and rewarding. Use Blueprints to manage stealth actions and enemy detection.

Implementation: Stealth mechanics can be added by scripting enemy AI with vision cones and noise detection. Players can hide in underwater vegetation or behind rocks to avoid detection.

Example: Players must avoid patrolling underwater drones or predators by staying out of sight and making minimal noise, adding a layer of strategy to movement.

World-Building

Assassin's Creed 2: Create immersive environments like cities with rich details. Use Unreal Engine's landscape and asset tools to design varied, engaging locations.

Implementation: Build detailed underwater environments using Unreal Engine’s landscape and asset tools, including underwater ruins, coral reefs, and sunken ships to explore.

Example: The game could feature an ancient underwater city with labyrinthine structures, adding depth and lore to the exploration.

Bioshock: Create an immersive world with detailed environments and background stories. Use Unreal Engine's level design tools to build atmospheric settings.

Implementation: Use lighting, sound design, and environmental storytelling to create an atmospheric underwater world that feels alive and rich with history.

Example: Players uncover the remnants of a lost civilization, with environmental clues that hint at its downfall and secrets to discover.

Skyrim: Offer a vast world with endless exploration opportunities. Use Unreal Engine's landscape tools to build an expansive, immersive world.

Impractical: Implementing a vast, open world in an infinite swimmer game may detract from the focused gameplay experience.

Red Dead Redemption 2: Create a highly detailed and interactive world. Use Unreal Engine's landscape and asset tools to build immersive environments.

Implementation: Populate the underwater world with interactive elements such as moving schools of fish, dynamic water currents, and interactive flora and fauna.

Example: Players can interact with various marine life, collect resources, and trigger events by exploring different areas.

Ghost of Tsushima: Focus on creating a beautiful and immersive world. Use Unreal Engine's rendering tools to enhance visual quality and environmental details.

Implementation: Use advanced rendering techniques to create visually stunning underwater scenes with realistic lighting, water effects, and detailed textures.

Example: The underwater world features vibrant coral reefs, bioluminescent caves, and crystal-clear waters, creating a visually captivating experience.

Ease-of-Use/Accessibility

Detroit: Become Human: Implement a narrative that changes based on player decisions. Use Blueprints to manage decision trees and branching storylines.

Impractical: Implementing a complex branching narrative may not align with the continuous nature of an infinite swimmer game.

Spider-Man 2018 Remastered PC: Optimize visuals and performance for PC players. Use Unreal Engine's rendering tools to enhance graphics and performance.

Implementation: Optimize the game for different hardware configurations by adjusting graphical settings, ensuring smooth performance across various PC setups.

Example: Players can adjust settings like texture quality, shadow detail, and water effects to balance performance and visual fidelity.

The Last of Us Part One Remake: Enhance AI behavior for more challenging gameplay. Use Blueprint scripting to manage AI improvements and interactions.

Implementation: Create sophisticated enemy AI that adapts to player actions, providing a challenging and engaging experience. AI behavior can be tuned for different difficulty levels.

Example: Enemies become more aggressive and intelligent as the game progresses, forcing players to adapt their strategies and movements.
