# Blockbuster Movie Experience in a Casual-Controlled Mobile Game

## Define/Identify/Adhere-to/Track

### Hardware Targets
- Define the specific hardware platforms the game will support (e.g., iOS, Android, specific mobile devices).
- Ensure the game is optimized for performance and visual quality on these platforms.

### Player Constraints and Limitations
- Identify and document the constraints players may face, such as screen size, touch controls, and battery life.
- Design gameplay mechanics and user interfaces that accommodate these limitations.

### Fictional Technologies within the Game
- List and describe the fictional technologies present in the game world.
- Ensure these technologies are integrated consistently within the game's story and mechanics.

### GPT's Job (What to Do with the Information)
- Utilize the provided information to generate dialogues, scenarios, and narrative elements that align with the game's design.
- Assist in refining and expanding the game's storyline and character development.

#### Notes on the GPT's Job:
- Use the Save-the-Cat! story structure's predictable-yet-satisfying patterns to create mildly-challenging, highly-interesting gameplay opportunities/player-choice options utilizing movement mechanics. Express most, if not all, of the opening movement's cohesive and engaging narrative through these mechanics.
- Prioritize gameplay as a device to maintain the player's interest and emotional investment over "telling" the story with dialogue, narration, or any other storytelling device.
- Ensure the stakes are always:
  1. Survive by using movement mechanics.
  2. An extension of the former stakes.
- Find opportunities to make the player-character relatable through mechanics first. Express every possible aspect of the story, plot, and player-character by how the player navigates the player-character through the gameplay opportunities and choices provided. Define the experience by how the predictable-yet-satisfying patterns present these gameplay opportunities to the player.

### Player Character's Goals
- **Ultimate, Constant Goal:** Clearly define the overarching goal that drives the player character throughout the game.
- **Smaller Goals:** Identify the smaller, incremental goals the player character must achieve to progress toward the ultimate goal.

## Movement Mechanics Will Drive:

### a) First Impression
- Design the initial movement mechanics to create a strong, positive first impression on the player.

### b) Story's Fundamental Theme
- Use movement mechanics to convey the story's theme, reflecting the player character's "ordinary world" and its creatures.

### c) Gear and Choice to Move Deeper
- Show the player character's gear and decisions to venture further into the "extraordinary world" through movement mechanics.

### d) Secondary Plot (NO ROMANCE STATED)
- Develop a secondary plot that complements the main storyline without introducing romance.

### e) Story's Premise and Exploration
- Use movement mechanics to test the player character and explore the story's premise.

### f) Emotionally Impactful Event
- Create an event using creatures (possibly cute ones) that changes the story's direction meaningfully.
- Show the player character's resilience through movement mechanics to overcome the event.

### g) Mounting Pressure and Complications
- Design scenarios where the player character faces increasing pressure to survive and navigates complications.

### h) Dark Night of the Soul
- Orchestrate a moment where it feels like all is lost, building up to it and allowing time afterward to reinforce this feeling.

### i) Solution/Inspiration
- Develop a moment where the player character finds a solution or inspiration, pushing her towards the opening movement's climax.

### j) Final Confrontation and Mirroring Image
- Design the final confrontation of the opening story movement.
- Ensure the final imagery mirrors the opening image to create a cohesive narrative arc.

## Underwater Infinite-Runner Game Mechanics Document

### 1. Initial Concept

#### Adapted Core Mechanics

1. **Automatic Forward Movement**:
   - **Description**: The player character swims forward continuously without any input from the player.

2. **Directional Input in Calm Waters**:
   - **Vertical Movement**:
     - **Swipe Up**: Ascend.
     - **Swipe Down**: Descend.
   - **Horizontal Movement**:
     - **Swipe Left**: Move left.
     - **Swipe Right**: Move right.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 100% control over movements.

3. **Turbulence**:
   - **Description**: Periodic turbulence affects the playerâ€™s control over their position.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: Player has ~25% control over their position, requiring more awareness and faster movements to avoid obstacles.
   - **Mechanics**:
     - **Resistance**: Movements require ~4x the effort compared to calm conditions.
     - **Strategy**: Players need to be more strategic in timing their movements to avoid obstacles and enemies.

4. **Fast Currents**:
   - **Description**: Sections where the player is pulled into faster up/down currents.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: Player has ~50% control over horizontal movements and almost no control over vertical movements.
   - **Mechanics**:
     - **Obstacle Navigation**: Arrange terrain and larger animals that the player must navigate and traverse.
     - **Point Multipliers**: Opportunities to earn multipliers by chaining moves together.
     - **Strategy**: Focus on chaining moves horizontally while managing minimal vertical control.

5. **Pressure Bursts**:
   - **Description**: Short-duration bursts of water pressure push the player towards the nearest edge of the screen.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: Player has ~75% effectiveness in movements.
   - **Mechanics**:
     - **Directional Influence**: Pressure bursts push the player, making control slightly more difficult.
     - **Game Over Condition**: If the player is knocked off-screen, they lose control and sink/flail out of sight, resulting in game over.
     - **Strategy**: Players need to be mindful of their position relative to screen edges and react quickly to pressure bursts.

### 2. Simplified Mobile Gestures
- **Automatic Forward Movement**: Continuous forward movement without player input.
- **Directional Input**:
  - **Calm Waters**:
    - **Swipe Up**: Ascend.
    - **Swipe Down**: Descend.
    - **Swipe Left**: Move left.
    - **Swipe Right**: Move right.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 100% control.
  - **Turbulence**:
    - **Swipe Up**: Ascend with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Swipe Down**: Descend with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Swipe Left**: Move left with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Swipe Right**: Move right with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 25% control.
  - **Fast Currents**:
    - **Swipe Left/Right**: Horizontal movements with 50% control.
    - **Swipe Up/Down**: Minimal vertical control.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 50% horizontal control.
  - **Pressure Bursts**:
    - **Swipe Up/Down/Left/Right**: Movements with 75% effectiveness.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 75% control.

### 3. Example Configuration
1. **Automatic Forward Movement**: The character swims forward continuously.
2. **Directional Movement in Calm Waters**:
   - **Swipe Up**: Swim upward.
   - **Swipe Down**: Swim downward.
   - **Swipe Left**: Swim left.
   - **Swipe Right**: Swim right.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 100% control.
3. **Turbulence**:
   - **Swipe Up/Down/Left/Right**: Movements require more effort.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 25% control.
4. **Fast Currents**:
   - **Swipe Left/Right**: Horizontal movements.
   - **Minimal Control**: Vertical movements.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 50% horizontal control.
5. **Pressure Bursts**:
   - **Swipe Up/Down/Left/Right**: Movements slightly affected by pressure.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 75% control.

### 4. Additional Considerations
- **Environmental Variety**: Different underwater settings (e.g., coral reefs, sunken ships) to keep the game visually interesting.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Incorporate moving obstacles, such as schools of fish or underwater currents, to add variety and challenge.
- **Buoyancy and Resistance**: Simulate water resistance to add realism to movements.

### Summary
By focusing on these specific movement mechanics, the game can provide an engaging and challenging experience that emphasizes strategic navigation and quick reflexes. The different environmental conditions (calm waters, turbulence, fast currents, pressure bursts) offer varying levels of control, adding depth and variety to the gameplay.
