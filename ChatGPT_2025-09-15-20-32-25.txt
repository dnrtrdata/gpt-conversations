Adjust the following part of my original short story’s chapters…

“Chapter 1:
The dawn arrived punctual and unyielding, slicing through Maia Kahananui’s blinds at exactly 5:03 a.m.—three minutes ahead of her alarm.
She exhaled. Already awake.
Her world was built on precision—bed corners tucked as sharply as reef edges, tourist brochures lined up like gravestones, a schedule carved into her bones: RUN. SWIM. WORK. REPEAT. Structure was her armor, the only thing keeping her from slipping into the same uncertainty that had taken her mother away.
The morning news hummed from the kitchen radio—reports of jellyfish blooms and beached dolphins—but Maia tuned it out beneath the blender’s roar. The ocean had always been unpredictable. That’s why she stayed in pools now. Chlorinated. Contained.
Outside, the island woke with her. Tourists chasing sunrise photos. Early divers heading for the reefs. The world kept moving, indifferent to the fact that Maia Kahananui never let herself slow down.

Chapter 2:
Her phone buzzed.
Uncle James.
His voice, sandpaper-rough, crackled through the speaker: “Another tourist boat reported something strange near the reef. You seen anything?”
Maia deleted the message. Not her problem.
At the resort, the pool stretched glassy and controlled—so unlike the open ocean. Maia knifed through it, arms slicing the surface with mechanical efficiency. One, two, breathe. One, two, breathe. Then—a flicker beneath her. A shadow, gone too fast to name.
Her heartbeat stuttered.
The lifeguard’s radio rasped from the deck: “Coastal hazards increasing. Unprecedented marine activity. Stay vigilant.”
Maia pulled herself out of the water, blinking hard.
She didn’t believe in omens.
Back home, her father sat hunched over the kitchen table, papers spread around him—unpaid bills, college brochures from the mainland. Stanford. UCLA. Berkeley. The future, waiting. He sighed, rubbing his temple, then muttered without looking up,
“Discipline isn’t strength.”
The words landed like salt in a wound.
Maia curled her hands around her coffee mug. She knew what he meant. Control won’t keep you from losing people. The unspoken comparison to her mother, Maureen, hung between them, heavy as storm air.
But Maia held onto control anyway. It was all she had.

Chapter 3:
After work, Noah Reyes was waiting for her, leaning against her car, arms crossed, sun-bleached and effortless.
He smelled like salt and recklessness. Like the part of her childhood she’d buried when Maureen left.
“Come back to open water,” he said. “The bay misses you.”
So did he.
Maia shook her head, unlocking the door. “I’m good.”
She wasn’t.
The ocean was chaos. No boundaries. No rules. Just like the mother who had walked out on them three years ago.
“You used to love it.”
“I used to love a lot of things.”
Noah let her go, but his words clung to her like salt on skin.

Chapter 4:
Through the resort’s massive windows, Nalani Chen spun practiced smiles, selling paradise by the weekend. Guests sipped overpriced mai tais, oblivious to the subtle wrongness Maia had begun to notice—the small, creeping shifts in the water.
Odd holes in fishing nets.
Missing pets.
The silence where reef fish should have been humming.
Even the ocean smelled different.
But no one paid attention. That’s how it always was here. Dress up the island, polish the edges, sell the fantasy.
Ignore the warnings.

Chapter 5:
The afternoon passed in routine. Lap counts. Lifeguard rotations. Fixing a guest’s bad diving form.
Then—
A scream.
Maia was already moving.
Kai—her twelve-year-old female mentee who kept getting in trouble for sticky fingers in the shops—flailed in the deep end, eyes wild. The pool’s water, crystal-clear moments ago, had darkened around him. Something moved beneath.
Weight. Water. Pull.
Maia’s instincts took over. She grabbed Kai, yanked her up. For a moment, something vast and smooth brushed against her leg.
She didn’t scream. Didn’t freeze. Just shoved Kai onto solid ground, forcing her voice steady: “You’re okay.”
She tasted copper, realized she’d bitten the inside of her cheek.
The water was still now. Empty. Normal.
Like nothing had ever been there.

Chapter 6:
That night, an old widow whispered about the hunger of the sea, her voice curling around ancient warnings in a modern tongue.
Fishermen cursed hooks stripped clean, metal warped by something that wasn’t human.
Then, at dusk—
The ocean ruptured.
A vortex collapsed inward—silent—before exploding skyward, drenching Maia in salt and something deeper, something colder.
And staring back at her, from the abyss where the water had torn open—
Something vast.
Something ancient.
Eyes that knew her name.
Knew her fears.
Knew the precise depth of every abandonment she had ever survived.
The world fell silent.
And in that silence, Maia Kahananui realized—
Her rules wouldn’t save her from this.”
