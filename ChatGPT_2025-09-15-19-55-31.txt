I. FOUNDATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

  A. Games are authored but incomplete without the player
     - Players must co-create the experience through interaction.
     - Story structure should account for variable pacing, choice, and agency.
     - Narrative cohesion must survive partial exploration.

  B. Emotional authenticity drives connection
     - Draw from personal truths; if it’s not meaningful to the writer, it won’t be meaningful to the player.
     - Ground genre spectacle in emotional realism—make the fantastical feel human.

  C. Story is gameplay; gameplay is story
     - Mechanics, UI, level layout, and even moment-to-moment combat must reflect character values and story arcs.
     - Narrative dissonance between action and theme breaks immersion and message alignment.

II. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE TECHNIQUES

  1. “Vertical Slice” Prototyping
     - Build a representative section of the game early.
     - Use it to define visual fidelity, narrative tone, mechanic integration, and emotional effect.

  2. Environmental and systemic storytelling
     - Create worlds that players read like text—visual cues, ambient storytelling, and spatial layout express subtext.
     - Every detail (props, layout, traversal paths) should reinforce theme and character arcs.

  3. Layered interactivity
     - Dialogue can be ambient and interruptible, but should resume naturally if the player disengages.
     - Optional conversations and discoveries should reward curiosity rather than punish directness.

III. CHARACTER & EMOTION ALIGNMENT

  i. Characters drive mechanics
     - AI companions should not only functionally assist but evolve emotionally through gameplay (e.g. Ellie saving Joel reinforces story bond).
     - Mechanics like axe-throwing or stealth perception filters are designed to reflect character growth or player emotion.

  ii. Use gameplay beats to show emotional transformation
     - Scripted moments are important but must preserve player agency.
     - Emotional turning points (e.g. Joel choosing Ellie over humanity) are dramatized through limited control, not full cutscenes.

  iii. Character evolution informs pacing
     - Kratos’ shift from vengeance to fatherhood required mechanical restraint and quieter beats.
     - Nathan Drake’s conflict between thrill-seeking and domestic life was echoed in the game’s structure and cinematic pacing.

IV. PRODUCTION PRACTICES TO ALIGN VISION

  I. Collaborative narrative culture
     - Encourage all team members, regardless of title, to contribute to story alignment.
     - Use pitch decks, reference videos, and frequent reiteration to sustain team-wide narrative clarity.

  II. Open creative dialogue
     - Creative directors must actively listen to feedback, especially dissent.
     - Shared authorship across disciplines ensures gameplay supports story and vice versa.

  III. “Plan for chaos” methodology
     - Story breakthroughs often arise mid-production, not in pre-planned documents.
     - Maintain flexibility for emotional or thematic shifts triggered by unforeseen development outcomes.

V. PLAYER EXPERIENCE STRATEGIES

  A. Reward curiosity
     - Design game systems and narrative payoffs that recognize non-linear exploration.
     - Let players “feel” discovery (e.g. secret scenes, boat conversations, optional puzzles).

  B. Minimize UI, maximize immersion
     - Replace HUD elements with in-world cues (e.g. audio filters signaling danger).
     - Keep players present emotionally, not just informationally.

  C. Emotional layering through juxtaposition
     - Contrast bleakness with beauty (e.g. giraffes in The Last of Us after cannibal sequence).
     - Use tonal shifts to highlight growth and moral ambiguity.

VI. FINAL GUIDELINES FOR SCREENWRITERS ENTERING GAME NARRATIVE

  1. Think dramaturgically but architecturally
     - Scenes aren’t just sequential—they’re explorable, interruptible, and player-driven.

  2. Dialogue must serve layered functions
     - Emotional subtext, player guidance, and contextual lore should coexist without overwhelming the player.

  3. Write modularly
     - Scenes may be experienced out of order or skipped.
     - Story impact must survive nonlinear engagement.

  4. Thematic coherence beats linear plot
     - The story’s philosophical core—what it’s “about”—guides all content decisions.

  5. Design with incomplete experience in mind
     - Accept that not all content will be seen.
     - Prioritize emotional resonance over coverage.

  6. Embrace playtesting as narrative calibration
     - Observe how players interpret, engage, and respond emotionally.
     - Adjust pacing, clarity, or delivery style based on behavioral feedback.

  7. Always remember: interactivity is not an obstacle to story—it is story.
