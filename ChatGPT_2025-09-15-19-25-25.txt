I need some accessible drills for two catchers who're a bit anxious about getting close to the batter for fear of getting hit with the bat. It makes the pitchers' job more difficult because even when they throw strikes, the ball often hits the dirt in front of the catchers and gets by them or will get stuck under them almost every pitch. The pitchers have to keep runners and the batter and the pitch count and the signs... how can I get the catchers confident snug up against the batter so they can catch more pitches?

Alright, Coach — Lou Piniella here. I like your question because it’s about solving a problem that every young catcher eventually has to face: fear of the bat. That’s real, and if we don’t tackle it, it throws the whole defense out of rhythm — pitchers get frustrated, base runners take liberties, and the whole game feels uphill.

We’re going to work on confidence, positioning, and progression.

Step 1: Build Comfort Without the Bat

Before we even put a hitter in the box:

Framing Zone Drill: Have your catcher set up at normal depth with no batter present. Pitcher (or coach with soft toss/underhand) throws balls right into the strike zone. Catcher just catches, receives, resets. Reinforce that this is their safe zone.

Glove Tap Drill: Toss tennis balls, wiffle balls, or soft baseballs at them while they set up. Encourage them to “beat the ball to the spot” with quiet hands. No batter, just the ball. Confidence grows when their eyes are trained to the target.

Step 2: Introduce the Batter Safely

We don’t go straight from “nothing” to “full swing threat.” Instead, use progression:

Batter Stands Still: Have a teammate stand in the box with no bat. Catcher sets up at regulation distance. Let them catch pitches with just a body in the box.

Batter Holds Bat Still: Batter holds the bat on their shoulder but does not swing. Catchers now realize the bat isn’t an active threat every pitch.

Dry Swings Behind Them: Have the batter take slow-motion or full dry swings with no ball while the catcher is crouched. This lets the catcher feel the timing of when and where the bat passes without the ball involved.

Step 3: Controlled Live Look

Coach-Controlled Batting: Batter only tracks pitches, no swings. Catcher focuses on receiving.

Called Swings Only: Tell the batter “only swing if I call it.” Catchers begin to build rhythm, learning that most pitches don’t involve contact at all.

Step 4: Technical Tweaks for Catchers

Positioning Cue: Remind them to set up slightly behind the batter’s back foot line — that half-step makes all the difference in confidence while still being close enough to block and frame.

Stance Stability Drill: Catcher sets up, holds their glove out, and coach or teammate gently nudges them with a pad on the shoulder. This teaches them they’re anchored, not drifting forward into danger.

Blocking Work Without Fear: Roll tennis balls, wiffle balls, then regular baseballs in front of them to block. The more they master the block without a hitter, the more confidence they’ll have to “own the space” when the batter’s there.

Step 5: Reinforcement

Talk Mental Game: Tell them that the batter is not their concern — the ball is. The bat rarely contacts a catcher, and pros sit inches behind a hitter without flinching. Confidence comes from reps and routine.

Celebrate Wins: Every time they set up correctly and catch cleanly, you make it a big deal. Build pride in the role.

Coach, this is a progressive exposure program — like easing into cold water instead of jumping in. Once your catchers see the batter is just background noise, they’ll hug the plate and do the job your pitchers need.

👉 Want me to lay out a two-week catcher confidence program with daily drills that progressively build them up to full game readiness?

Not at this time.

That’s just fine, Coach. You’ve got the framework now to chip away at this little by little — no need to rush. Keep it progressive, keep it positive, and your catchers will start moving up closer without even realizing the fear’s gone.

And remember — catchers set the tone. When they’re confident, the whole team breathes easier, especially your pitchers.

Would you like me to also give you a set of in-practice mini-drills (5 minutes each) that you can sprinkle into warmups, so it doesn’t feel like a big “catcher-only” session? Those sometimes work better with younger players.
