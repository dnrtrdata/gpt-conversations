Okay, first I need you to sort the tags by what aspect of storytelling they most closely relate to based on the following methodology:
a. STRUCTURE AS SYMPTOM  
Definition: Structure arises naturally from the protagonist’s evolving relationship with the central dramatic argument  
Purpose: To ensure narrative emerges organically from character choices rather than forcing events into a template  

b. CENTRAL DRAMATIC ARGUMENT (THEME)  
Definition: The arguable assertion around which all story changes revolve  
Purpose: To provide unity and meaning, guiding character transformation and plot purpose  

c. CHARACTER‑DRIVEN NARRATIVE  
Definition: Story progression determined by protagonist’s goals, beliefs, and choices  
Purpose: To create authentic emotional engagement and logical causal flow  

d. THEME‑BASED ARC  
Definition: Journey from initial belief in the anti‑theme to full embodiment of the theme through action  
Purpose: To frame the narrative drive and measure character growth  

e. STASIS AND IRONIC DISRUPTION  
Definition: Initial equilibrium based on anti‑theme belief disrupted by a tailored event  
Purpose: To force the protagonist into action and reveal their core fear  

f. AXES OF CHANGE  
Definition: Internal (mind and emotion), interpersonal (main relationship), and external (plot events) dimensions  
Purpose: To create layered conflict and track transformation across dimensions  

g. SCENE DYNAMICS (DIALECTIC)  
Definition: Each scene presents a thesis, introduces an antithesis, and resolves in a synthesis  
Purpose: To propel continuous narrative evolution and maintain scene‑level tension  

h. SECOND ACT PATTERN  
Definition: Sequence of reinforcing anti‑theme, introducing doubt, midpoint revelation, and thematic reversal  
Purpose: To deepen tension, challenge beliefs, and prepare for crisis  

i. CRISIS POINT (LOW POINT)  
Definition: Moment when the protagonist loses old goals and cannot yet embrace the new  
Purpose: To heighten stakes, expose vulnerability, and set up final test  

j. DEFINING MOMENT (CLIMAX)  
Definition: Final challenge where protagonist must act in alignment with the theme  
Purpose: To resolve central argument through decisive embodiment and triumph  

k. RESOLUTION (DENOUEMENT)  
Definition: New equilibrium showcasing protagonist’s transformation in harmony with theme  
Purpose: To deliver catharsis and demonstrate thematic fulfillment  

l. WRITER AS ORCHESTRATOR  
Definition: Writer engineers tailored obstacles, ironies, and tests around protagonist’s fears and beliefs  
Purpose: To sustain dramatic momentum and guide character toward thematic truth

i. CENTRAL DRAMATIC ARGUMENT (THEME)  
- The thematic pretension undermines the clarity of a simple narrative premise.  
- The theme is buried within optional collectibles rather than centralizing it in the story.  
- The thematic focus becomes incoherent due to inconsistent tonal execution.  
- The setting's excesses obscure the thematic structure.  
- The thematic buildup is discarded in favor of a joke resolution.  
- The story introduces themes that are never resolved.  
- The narrative avoids deep questions by constantly expanding its scope.  
- The story’s thematic coherence collapses under its structural choices.  
- The narrative loses thematic consistency as it stretches across an open-world format.  
- Procedural design undermines the resonance of core thematic ideas.  
- The theme is introduced but is quickly lost beneath mechanical routines.  
- The story uses ambiguity not to explore theme but to avoid committing to one.  
- Gimmick-based scenarios dilute the weight of the story's intended theme.  
- The theme of exploration is choked by a design obsessed with obscurity.  
- The philosophical conflict is undermined when the player is allowed to bypass it entirely.  
- The game’s emotionally cold aesthetic mutes the resonance of its intended themes.  
- The horror tone relies on repetition and loses its intended meaning.  
- Repetition turns horror aesthetics into mechanical loops devoid of meaning.  
- Supernatural elements are included without emotional consequence or narrative relevance.  
- Horror imagery repeats without supporting the narrative’s thematic goals.  
- Satirical moments exist but lack thematic direction or clarity.  
- The story presents existential dread as logical detachment without emotional grounding.  
- The story includes symbolism but never develops it into meaningful commentary.  
- The game dresses up vacuous events with empty symbols that add no thematic value.  
- Nostalgia is exploited, but the game lacks the bravery to thematically match the original.  
- The game gestures toward a theme about creation but never explores its implications.

ii. CHARACTER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE (AGENCY)  
- The character shows no arc and learns nothing by the end.  
- The protagonist's motivation repeats without evolution or reflection.  
- The protagonist is defined entirely by apathy and detached cynicism.  
- The protagonist's emotional appeal is undermined by repetitive story beats.  
- The hero lacks a clear thematic identity or inner drive.  
- The main character fits a tragic mold but is never expanded beyond cliché.  
- The protagonist’s amnesia serves as a lazy shortcut to avoid true character work.  
- The main character exists in the world without justification or grounding.  
- The protagonist’s backstory is built on an implausible exile used purely for convenience.  
- The uniqueness of the hero has no relevance to the progression of the plot.  
- The protagonist’s passivity is disguised as quiet contemplation but achieves neither.  
- The protagonist's actions contradict their own stated motivations.  
- The player is told what the character feels, but the actions never reflect it.  
- Relationships between characters are shallow and undeveloped.  
- Emotional stakes set up early are dropped without resolution.  
- The emotional core of the journey never connects to the gameplay loop.  
- Emotional growth is stalled by a plot that lacks direction.  
- The character's arc is reduced to swapping cosmetics, not emotional growth.  
- Major emotional turns are interrupted by systems and mechanics.  
- The game avoids genuine emotional conflict by making its characters inarticulate.  
- The emotional weight of the story is sabotaged by overlong or uneven pacing.  
- Emotional moments from earlier are reused instead of developed further.  
- Attempts at empathy are rendered inert by the game’s own detachment.  
- The main story conflict lacks any personal meaning for the hero.  
- The game sets up internal struggles that never affect the plot or character behavior.  
- The protagonist shows inner conflict, but the game never allows it to matter.  
- The game sets up a form-function contradiction in the main character’s identity.  
- The protagonist’s identity becomes a collection of aesthetic options.  
- The character’s entire motivation boils down to vague confusion.

iii. THEME-BASED ARC (TRANSFORMATION)  
- The revenge arc is muddled by structural symmetry that dilutes emotional stakes.  
- The protagonist repeats the same choices instead of evolving from them.  
- The main character is given multiple opportunities to grow but refuses each time.  
- Shifting perspectives replace development with superficial exposition.  
- Emotional flatness is mistaken for complexity, draining weight from major turns.  
- Visual spectacle overwhelms and flattens any meaningful internal growth.  
- Constant suffering exhausts empathy before it can turn into transformation.  
- Desperation is repeated so often that it becomes the protagonist's destiny, not a phase.  
- The narrative can't sustain its arc due to incoherent thematic framing.  
- The story’s serious themes blunt the surrealist tools that could have supported transformation.  
- All tonal or stylistic charm has been flattened by the need for narrative consistency.

iv. STASIS AND IRONIC DISRUPTION (CATALYST)  
- The inciting incident is either missing, delayed, or irrelevant.  
- The open world is filled with tasks that delay the protagonist’s need to act.  
- Discovery is teased, but nothing meaningful ever results from it.  
- Urgency is erased when emotional motivation is replaced by checklist cleanup.  
- The comedic edge once present has been dulled by overt moralization.  
- The story resets direction so often that nothing feels like a true disruption.

v. AXES OF CHANGE (DIMENSIONS)  
- The supporting cast lacks individual voices or goals.  
- Even major secondary characters have no distinct personality or voice.  
- Supporting roles appear then vanish without affecting the character or story.  
- Emotional stakes among supporting characters are never developed.  
- The ensemble feels like background noise rather than meaningful relationships.  
- Relationships are written to support function, not emotional development.  
- The game leans on implied history rather than building relationships on-screen.  
- The relationship conflict is explained through flashbacks instead of action.  
- Interlude sequences fail to reinforce character or thematic progression.  
- The ensemble exists in the same space but never feels connected.  
- The parental motive is presented as emotional shorthand with no follow-through.

i. CENTRAL DRAMATIC ARGUMENT (THEME)  
Definition: The arguable assertion around which all story changes revolve  
Purpose: To provide unity and meaning, guiding character transformation and plot purpose  

SUBCATEGORY: Nature of Opposing Forces  
Concept Summary: Many of the tags in this category explore the central theme as a conflict between two opposing worldviews or paradigms — nature vs. machine, tradition vs. systemic control, trauma vs. recovery. These oppositional constructs define the story’s thematic spine and offer the protagonist a philosophical battleground.  

- Machine environments are rendered cold and unfeeling, heightening the contrast against organic emotion.  
- The final conflict is designed to embody a collision of ideals, not just a resolution of plot.  
- Ancestral stories and settings are positioned to reflect unresolved emotional truths.  
- Societal collapse is shown as a mirror of systemic injustice, rather than just environmental fallout.  
- Class distinctions are baked into setting mechanics to emphasize systemic imbalance.  
- Natural disasters or elemental threats represent an uncaring universe in thematic opposition to human resilience.  
- Parental instincts are tested through uncanny threats, emphasizing primal emotion against chaos.  
- Vast exploration spaces reinforce a sense of eternal longing that rebukes structured morality.  
- Level transitions symbolically emulate the character’s effort to rebuild inner cohesion.  
- Shifting level boundaries echo the protagonist’s desire for emotional boundaries and control.  
- The environment's ambiguity forces the player to interpret emotional cues instead of receiving them directly.  
- Shadowed contrasts between light and dark serve as visual metaphors for internal conflict.  
- The world gradually strips the player of choices to emphasize control as illusion.  
- Humor undercuts emotional convention, forcing the player to question expected catharsis.  
- Genre conventions are resisted not to innovate but to preserve the purity of the theme.  
- Memory and identity do not reveal character — they obscure it, requiring player interpretation.

User:


Broaden the tags a little further, ensuring anyone with a high-school education (in a first-world Western country) could reasonably be expected to understand each individual term within each respective tag within each respective category and maintaining the sorted order of how each category is presented which will ensure the our defined order-of-operations for developing the required narrative-creation decisions to write a movie consistent with the ideas represented in the tags as a whole are true to our original intention in defining all of the above.

In short, we know what we think is/is-not a GOOD idea/concept/device to include in a passive-medium narrative we would want to write in a format like a screenplay and see represented in a film. Now we're creating a definitive shared creative language with which to use for the narrative's initial draft and ensuring its comprehension, sophistication, and scope to ensure that-- when we begin using it -- there's no room for misunderstandings. We put in a lot of effort to include all the "GOOD" little granular aspects we needed, and the more macro-level presentation would be most effective to tell the kind of narrative that makes sense to -- and excites -- us as a story to share with the world that could only come from us. Now we're defining the threshold of specificity and culture and all other comprehensible (to us) things that paint the picture of the world it would be happening in: our world. Does that all make sense?

We've already agreed that each tag expresses something good about a story we've examined -- so I want each tag to be explicitly worded to express it's respective idea so it's clear to anyone with the aforementioned education-level what the idea is and what/how/why that idea is good (for our purposes) WITHOUT becoming so long an specific that it defeats the purpose of a tag and just becomes a complete explanatory-sentence. You'll likely need to draw on convention, intuition, and cleverness to accomplish this task. I'm only asking you to do it because it would be require monumental time and effort commitments to try/fail/iterate/repeat enough to accomplish it myself with any meaningful impact... you're goin to do it because you have an almost absurd amount of computational power, technological functions breakthroughs, and dataset-quantity built in to your systems so that you can do in a few seconds what would likely take me months/years. Help me super-gadget.
