I want to create a game scenario based on the idea of getting into, and navigating through the White House to protect the president during an attack by a foreign power similar to the premise of Olympus Has Fallen, but with a verbose, boisterous president like Donald Trump who keeps trying to dictate the next steps by disregarding protocol and ignoring Secret Service expertise. The player is a former Secret Service agent and is capable of making his way to and providing the right steps to get the president to safety, but the gameplay would have to include a core loop of adapting the president's angsty, egotistical, and obnoxious responses/proclamations to our help into solutions that keep him safe nonetheless. First, search to understand the story of the film and examples the president (and his childish behavior) these ideas are based on in fine, granular detail. Once you have those foundations, I'll prompt you for what I need next.
--------------------------------------

Copy code
a) Olympus Has Fallen core incident timeline:
   i. North Korean commando Kang Yeonsak orchestrates a multifaceted assault that begins with a suicide attack by a KC-130 gunship strafing the National Mall, downing F-22 interceptors, crashing into the Washington Monument, and saturating the White House grounds with heavy ordnance :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
   ii. Simultaneously, dozens of ground infiltrators disguised as tourists surge the North Lawn, breach the North Portico, and neutralize uniformed Secret Service posts in under thirteen minutes, overwhelming the internal defense grid :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
   iii. Surviving Executive Protective Division agents rush President Benjamin Asher, Vice-President Rodriguez, Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan, and the visiting South-Korean delegation toward the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) deep beneath the East Wing :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
   iv. Protocol is violated when Asher insists the foreign prime minister and his security escort accompany him inside the PEOC, unknowingly giving Kang’s embedded mole, bodyguard Dave Forbes, direct bunker access :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
   v. Kang captures the bunker, executes Rodriguez on live feed, and demands the three-part Cerberus abort-code that will detonate every U.S. ICBM in its silo; he already holds codes from McMillan and Hoenig and tortures Asher for the final segment :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
   vi. Former presidential detail agent Mike Banning, operating alone inside the ruined mansion, eliminates intruders room-by-room, taps into Pentagon comms, provides ground intel to Acting President Allan Trumbull, rescues the First Son from a concealed wall crawl-space, then infiltrates the PEOC through a maintenance duct, killing the terrorists and neutralizing Cerberus with seconds to spare :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

b) Notable security-protocol breaches depicted:
   i. Allowing an unscreened foreign security team into PEOC contradicts USSS Security Handbook section on secure-core integrity, a plot hinge acknowledged even by fan discussions of the film’s biggest “if only they’d followed SOP” flaw :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
   ii. Command posts outside are unable to trigger the emergency surface-to-air batteries because the gunship disables the radar house first, showcasing reliance on a single point-of-failure that real continuity of government drills seek to avoid :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
   iii. Civilian air-space monitoring fails to classify the rogue C-130 soon enough, a narrative device used to compress the ‘golden five-minute’ decision window for cinematic tension :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

c) President Asher’s on-screen behavioral traits relevant to gameplay tension:
   i. Principled stubbornness—he refuses to abandon wounded personnel on the South Lawn helicopter pad moments before the bunker evacuation, forcing agents to hold position under fire :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
   ii. Protective paternalism—he orders Banning to save his son first even at the cost of his own life, creating conflicting objectives for the agent :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
   iii. Diplomatic courtesy overriding caution—his personal insistence on hosting the South-Korean delegation inside the PEOC directly enables Kang’s takeover :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

d) Real-world reference profile: Donald Trump’s pattern of impulsive, protocol-defiant conduct:
   i. January 6 2021—after urging supporters to march on the Capitol, Trump attempted to commandeer his armored SUV; when the lead agent refused, testimony says he lunged for the steering wheel, exemplifying volatile disregard for protective detail directives :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
   ii. Pandemic briefings—on 23 April 2020 he publicly mused about injecting disinfectant or using “very powerful light” inside the body, contradicting medical experts live on television, demonstrating willingness to ad-lib life-or-death guidance :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
   iii. Mask protocol—throughout 2020 campaign events he declined to wear face coverings and discouraged agents from masking, overriding USSS and CDC guidance and exposing staff to heightened risk :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
   iv. Repeated staff testimonies describe him as “deeply impulsive… without checks and balances around him,” often ignoring policy memos and national-security talking points during unscripted appearances :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
   v. Situation-room outbursts—accounts detail him veering off prepared remarks during White House events and berating senior officials, illustrating snap strategic reversals that professionals must clean up after :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

e) Convergences for gameplay loop design seed:
   i. Film demonstrates how a single presidential whim (bringing guests into the bunker) catastrophically undermines fortress-level defenses; Trump’s historical whims (refusing masks, demanding movement into unsecured zones) offer analogous challenge hooks for the player character to redirect or mitigate.
   ii. Core loop can revolve around reading the president’s latest proclamation, predicting second-order effects, then manipulating environment or comms to make the reckless order secretly safe while preserving his ego—mirroring Banning’s on-the-fly battlefield triage under Asher’s moral imperatives and Secret Service doctrine clashes.

1. Setup
   1.1 07:55 on Presidents Day, President Braxton T. Aldrich (flamboyant Trump analogue) is live-streaming a morning interview in the Rose Garden while berating the crew about camera angles.
   1.2 A hijacked C-130 begins a strafing run across the Mall; Secret Service races Aldrich toward the Marine One evacuation pad.
   1.3 Aldrich delays departure for “the money shot” of the Washington Monument in flames, losing a ninety-second safety margin the detail needed to clear the open lawn.

2. Assault
   2.1 Surface-to-air batteries are neutralized; commandos posing as National Park maintenance trucks crash the North Gate and overrun the front steps.
   2.2 Aldrich shocks agents by ordering the motorcade to the Capitol so he can “address the patriots”; when the lead driver refuses he grabs the wheel, causing a crash that strands the convoy in the East Wing service tunnel.
   2.3 While agents drag him inside he tweets “All fine, just fireworks”—broadcasting their route and prompting an ambush at the tunnel exit.

3. Bunker Breach
   3.1 Earlier, Aldrich had insisted a visiting trade delegation join him “for optics,” granting an embedded mole direct access to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.
   3.2 The mole’s team captures the bunker, executes the Vice-President, and activates a Cerberus-style launch-override that will scuttle U.S. ICBMs unless three codes are entered. Aldrich blurts part of his code on a hot mic, trying to bluff the terrorists.

4. Player Entrance
   4.1 Mason Drake, a recently resigned Secret Service agent fired after arguing over pandemic mask rules with Aldrich, is briefing Treasury security when the attack begins.
   4.2 Drake infiltrates the burning mansion alone; his gameplay loop centers on interpreting Aldrich’s impulsive commands into workable security moves without damaging the president’s ego or revealing the improvisation.

5. Reactive Presidential Hazards
   5.1 Aldrich refuses evacuation through a ventilation shaft, declaring it “too low energy”; Drake must find an alternate crawl-space and widen it silently.
   5.2 He demands a live video address from the Situation Room; Drake reroutes the stream through a dummy laptop upstairs to misdirect enemy thermal drones.
   5.3 He insists on retrieving “classified deal folders” from the Oval Office credenza; Drake chooses either a dangerous detour to retrieve them or fabricates convincing decoys.
   5.4 In mid-firefight Aldrich calls for a Diet Cola; Drake taps an emergency sprinkler line into a vending pipe, quietly restoring building water pressure while placating him.

6. Kidnap Pivot
   6.1 Discovering Aldrich’s volatility, the antagonist threatens Aldrich’s son instead. The panicked president blurts another code fragment. Drake activates a voice-over-IP jammer to block the last digits, buying time.

7. Climax
   7.1 Drake enters the PEOC through a forgotten civil-war era tunnel. Inside, Aldrich is negotiating golf-course concessions with the terrorist leader.
   7.2 Puzzle finale: Drake must steer Aldrich’s spontaneous rant into a specific sequence of catchphrases that secretly match a counter-hack kill-word, disabling the Cerberus system seconds before launch.

8. Resolution
   8.1 Aldrich emerges through the North Portico smoke waving a flag, proclaims total victory, and publicly fires most of the Secret Service while immediately rehiring Drake “because nobody else could keep up.”
   8.2 Post-credits: Drake receives a congressional subpoena over the improvised Diet Cola pipeline, teasing a sequel where he must defend his actions before a grand jury.

Now lose the specific times and names. Those will need to be fluid, if they are addressed at all. Just use labels for people -- and we'll now treat people only as characters (since we are in the realm of fiction). Make the labels like fun stereotypes of the characters they represent.
