We’re going to perform a call-and-answer thought experiment. I’m going to name a fictional story, maybe from several mediums. You’re going to tell me who the protagonist of that story is and a concise, reasoned, and pragmatic explanation of why you believe that character is the protagonist. I may ask follow up questions for each respective story, or I may name another story and you’ll repeat the process. You respond in plain text within code fences in a hierarchical structure for your reasoning to whatever degree is necessary. Ready?

Copy code
A. Protagonist: Game of Thrones features an ensemble cast, making it difficult to single out one clear protagonist; however, if one must be chosen, Jon Snow is often viewed as the de facto central character.

   1. Ensemble Structure:
      a. Multiple focal points drive the narrative—key characters like Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and others each have substantial arcs.
      b. The show intentionally disperses the narrative focus to depict a complex world where power and morality are multifaceted.

   2. Jon Snow’s Prominence:
      a. Central Arc: Jon Snow’s journey from the Night’s Watch to becoming a crucial leader in the struggle against existential threats is given significant narrative weight.
      b. Thematic Resonance: His internal conflicts—between honor, duty, and personal identity—and his gradual evolution into a reluctant hero encapsulate many of the series’ core themes.
      c. Audience Connection: His moral dilemmas and leadership challenges serve as a lens through which much of the political and supernatural intrigue of Westeros is filtered.

   3. Pragmatic Conclusion:
      a. Although Game of Thrones lacks a single protagonist by design, Jon Snow emerges as the closest equivalent due to his narrative prominence and the central role his choices play in advancing the overarching story.

Use the following text to examine all of your choices thus far:
1. DEFINITION
  1.1 Origin & Role: "Protagonist"—derived from the Greek for "first actor"—serves as the narrative center whose decisions and struggles drive the story.
  1.2 Dual Function: Represents both an abstract idea of narrative drive and a concrete example through characters like Ripley, T’Challa, Neo, and Carol Danvers.
2. CHARACTERISTICS
  2.1 Clear Goal/Desire
    • Establishes the character’s ambition (e.g., survival, revenge, justice) that guides the entire story.
    • Example: T’Challa’s quest to prove his worth as king in Black Panther.
  2.2 Active Decision-Making vs. Passive Reaction
    • Active characters make decisive choices that shape the plot.
    • Passive characters simply react to events, diminishing their impact.
    • Example: Neo’s deliberate choice of the red pill in The Matrix underscores his transformation.
  2.3 Confrontation and Struggle
    • Effective protagonists face significant challenges and setbacks that add real tension to their journey.
    • Example: Ripley’s fight to rescue Newt in Aliens demonstrates overcoming overwhelming obstacles.
  2.4 Evolving Character Arc

  3.3 The Matrix (Neo)
    • Neo makes pivotal choices—taking the red pill, rescuing Morpheus, and confronting Agent Smith—that mark his active transformation.
  3.4 Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers)
    • Carol’s lack of meaningful conflict leads to a static character arc, reducing the impact of her role as a transformative figure.
4. GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE PROTAGONISTS
  4.1 Do’s
    • Craft protagonists with clear, transformative goals that actively drive the narrative.
    • Ensure they face genuine, challenging conflicts that spur growth.
    • Design the story so that every decision has tangible, emotionally resonant consequences.

To supplement your info is a description of the plot:
A meteorite brings a malevolent, sentient extraterrestrialparasite to Earth. The parasite enters the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina, where it infects wealthy resident Grant by taking over his body and absorbing his mind. With the alien in control of him, Grant begins to transform into a grotesque, tentacled monstrosity. He also abducts and infects a local woman, Brenda, to serve as a breeder for his alien larvae. His wife Starla becomes suspicious over the changes in his appearance and behavior, leading to Grant attacking her. When the police arrive to rescue Starla, Grant flees.
During their search for Grant, a posse led by police chief Bill Pardy discovers Brenda, whose body has become inhumanly bloated from the larvae growing inside her. The slug-like larvae burst from her body and infest everyone in town except Starla, Bill, Mayor Jack MacReady, and teenager Kylie Strutemyer. Those infected by the larvae become part of a hive mind controlled by Grant, who intends to consume all lifeforms until only his consciousness remains. However, Grant also retains his love for his wife and seeks to be reunited with her. The survivors deduce that killing Grant will eliminate the rest of the aliens before they are attacked by the infected townspeople. Bill and Kylie escape, but Starla and Jack are captured.
Armed with a grenade to kill the monster, Bill and Kylie head to Grant's home, where the infected are being absorbed by the increasingly mutated Grant. Jack and others are turned into breeders for more larvae, while Grant keeps Starla uninfected in the hope of regaining her love. After waking up, Starla arms herself with a sharp brush and goes downstairs to find Grant. She tricks him into believing she still loves him and stabs him with the brush. Grant becomes angry and throws her across the room. Bill and Kylie enter the house after shooting several alien townfolk, and euthanize an infected Jack who begs for death. Bill tries to use the grenade, only for Grant to knock it into the pool, and Grant subdues Kylie with a couch and attempts to infect Bill with his tentacles. While one of the tentacles stabs Bill in the stomach, Bill attaches the other tentacle to a propane tank. Starla shoots Grant who, filled with flammable gas, explodes, killing the rest of the aliens in the process. With everyone else in Wheelsy dead, the three survivors head off to seek help.
In a post-credits scene, a cat approaches Grant's remains and becomes infected by the alien parasite.

To determine the singular protagonist across both parts of The Last of Us, could you please clarify what lens or framework you’d like to emphasize?

Are you more interested in narrative centrality (who the story primarily follows), emotional weight, character transformation, or moral complexity?

Do you want the choice to reflect the full arc across both games or prioritize one game more than the other?

Should player control (who the player spends more time as) be a major factor in your criteria?

Thematic Protagonist Analysis in The Last of Us Part I & II
Overarching Theme of the Two-Part Narrative

Across The Last of Us Part I and Part II, the combined narrative explores the destructive cycle of violence fueled by hate, and the potential for love, empathy, and forgiveness to break that cycle. Although Part II is grim and violent, it is “ultimately a story about love” prevailing over hatred
denofgeek.com
denofgeek.com
. In essence, the saga’s central theme can be summarized as love (or compassionate forgiveness) conquering hate, illustrating how characters driven by vengeance or fear can find redemption by choosing empathy and love instead of perpetuating violence
denofgeek.com
. Each of the three main characters – Joel, Ellie, and Abby – embodies different aspects of this theme across their arcs, either rejecting or embracing it by the end.

Joel’s Arc: From Loss and Hardened Survival to Paternal Love

Joel’s journey in Part I begins with him living in opposition to the theme, as a man emotionally shut down by trauma. After witnessing the horrific death of his daughter Sarah in the 2013 outbreak, Joel is left broken and cynical, simply surviving without hope or meaningful human connection
denofgeek.com
. This loss leaves him closed-off to love and empathy – a hardened survivor who initially resists forming any new attachments. In this state, Joel certainly isn’t guided by the narrative’s central virtues of love or forgiveness; if anything, he’s defined by detachment and a willingness to do brutal things to stay alive (as seen in his ruthless encounters with hunters and smugglers).

 

Over the course of Part I, however, Joel undergoes a profound transformation that brings him into alignment with the theme of love. Tasked with escorting the immune teen Ellie, Joel gradually lets down his walls and develops a deep fatherly bond with her
denofgeek.com
. By the end of Part I, he loves Ellie so much that he chooses personal love over the greater good: Joel is “willing to essentially let the world burn to save her life,” stopping the Fireflies from sacrificing Ellie to create a cure
denofgeek.com
. In the climactic hospital scene, Joel kills several Fireflies – including the head surgeon, who happens to be Abby’s father – solely to protect Ellie. This decision is morally fraught, but it is crucial to note Joel’s motivation: unlike a typical revenge-driven antihero, “he was never motivated by vengeance – only love”
denofgeek.com
. Every violent act Joel commits in that finale (from shooting Marlene to executing Abby’s father) is done out of desperate love and fear of losing his surrogate daughter, not out of hatred
denofgeek.com
.

 

Joel ends his arc living in accordance with the theme’s “love conquers hate” message – at least on a personal scale. He rediscovers his capacity for love and human connection through Ellie, which redeems his broken spirit. Joel’s emotional resolution comes in Part II’s early hours: he has settled into a peaceful life in Jackson, devoted to protecting Ellie and their community, effectively “living for the one he loves”
denofgeek.com
. In a flashback, Joel even affirms that saving Ellie was an act of love he “would do... all over again” despite its disastrous consequences
denofgeek.com
. This unwavering love ultimately costs him his life, as it spurred Abby’s vengeful fury. Narratively, Joel’s fatal choice in Part I is the catalyst for the cycle of violence that drives Part II
denofgeek.com
. Thus, Joel’s arc demonstrates the theme’s complexity: love gives him purpose and healing, yet that same love (expressed in a selfish way) ignites further hatred in others. He begins opposed to hope or attachment, and ends as a man defined by love – fulfilling the theme on a personal level, even if he doesn’t live to see the broader cycle broken.

Ellie’s Arc: From Innocence and Purpose to Vengeance and Finally Mercy

Ellie’s two-game arc is a tumultuous journey that ultimately tests her commitment to the theme of empathy over vengeance. In Part I, Ellie starts as a symbol of hope and altruism, very much in line with the central theme’s positive side. As a 14-year-old immune girl, she believes her life might “make the world a better place,” and she’s willing to sacrifice herself for a vaccine if needed
denofgeek.com
. Ellie is brave, idealistic, and has a clean conscience in the first game
denofgeek.com
. She forms a loving bond with Joel and experiences great loss and trauma (e.g. with Sam and Henry, and in the winter chapter with David), but notably she does not harbor hatred or seek revenge in Part I. By the end of the first game, however, Ellie senses the moral compromise Joel made for her. She suspects that Joel lied about the Fireflies, which plants seeds of disillusionment. Still, at this point she remains fundamentally a character driven by love, loyalty, and the hope of doing good – not yet at odds with the theme.

 

In Part II, Ellie’s arc takes a dark turn that pushes her into direct opposition to the theme. The inciting tragedy of Joel’s brutal murder at Abby’s hands shatters Ellie’s relatively innocent world. After witnessing Joel’s death, Ellie becomes consumed by hatred and revenge, single-mindedly determined to hunt down Abby at any cost
denofgeek.com
. This is a stark inversion of her earlier ideals. Whereas once Ellie’s identity and purpose were tied to saving others, now her purpose narrows to “nothing but murder on her mind”
denofgeek.com
. She forsakes the peaceful life she had begun to build in Jackson (and later on the farm) with Dina because “she still can’t let go of Abby and Joel”, illustrating how profoundly her trauma has damaged her
denofgeek.com
. Throughout the Seattle segment of Part II, Ellie brutally kills Abby’s friends one by one, growing more hardened and traumatized. Her vengeance quest even alienates her from those she loves – for example, she drives away Dina (and their baby JJ) by choosing to continue hunting Abby despite having a chance to live safely with her new family
denofgeek.com
denofgeek.com
. At her lowest point, Ellie is utterly opposed to the narrative’s theme: she embodies the self-perpetuating cycle of violence, unable to heal or forgive. Each act of revenge only deepens her pain, and the “anger, hatred, and resentment” consume her to the point that she “loses everything, including Dina and JJ” by the story’s end
denofgeek.com
.

 

Ellie’s climactic choice on the rattling shores of Santa Barbara marks the beginning of her return to alignment with the theme. In the final confrontation, Ellie initially attempts to fulfill her revenge – battling a weakened Abby and nearly drowning her. Yet at the decisive moment, Ellie experiences a gentle vision of Joel – “him sitting peacefully on the porch, playing his guitar”
denofgeek.com
 – instead of the bloody trauma that had haunted her. This memory of Joel’s love causes Ellie to stop; she lets Abby go free, breaking the cycle of violence at the last possible moment. By choosing mercy over murder, Ellie at last rejects the path of hate. Notably, this act is intertwined with forgiveness: as she spares Abby, Ellie is also finally beginning to forgive Joel for his lie, understanding that “he did it because he loved her”
denofgeek.com
. The theme’s influence is clear – love and forgiveness triumph, if bittersweetly, over vengeance. Ellie pays a heavy price for her enlightenment (she returns to find Dina and the baby gone, having sacrificed her family for an empty revenge
denofgeek.com
), and her emotional resolution is left purposefully ambiguous. In the final scene, Ellie leaves behind Joel’s guitar – symbolizing that she may be letting go of Joel’s ghost and her painful past
denofgeek.com
denofgeek.com
. We infer that Ellie is not “whole” yet, but she has taken the crucial step toward healing by relinquishing her hate. In terms of the overarching theme, Ellie’s storyline illustrates how vengeance can corrode even a loving person, and how only by letting go (of hate and of the past) can one find a path forward. She begins the saga aligned with love and hope, falls drastically into opposition (revenge/hate), and by the end strives to realign with empathy and forgiveness through her final act and implied willingness to try to live on. It’s a tragic, hard-earned arc that reinforces the narrative’s warning about violence and its call for compassion.

Abby’s Arc: From Vengeance Personified to Redemption through Empathy

Abby’s character arc in Part II is in many ways a mirror-image of Ellie’s, and she most explicitly embodies the theme of breaking the cycle of violence. When Abby is introduced, she is living squarely in opposition to the central theme – she represents vengeance incarnate. Haunted by the murder of her father (the Firefly surgeon Joel killed), Abby has spent years training and obsessing over getting revenge on Joel. By the time we meet her in Part II, “she’s obsessed with making Joel pay” for her father’s death
denofgeek.com
. This fixation defines her life: she even drags her friends to Jackson on a mission to kill Joel, a choice that ultimately dooms many of them as collateral damage in the ensuing cycle of retribution
denofgeek.com
denofgeek.com
. At the outset, Abby is hardened, wrathful, and seemingly devoid of mercy – the polar opposite of any theme of love or forgiveness. For example, in Jackson she not only executes Joel, but does so brutally (torturing him with a golf club) and initially shows no remorse. Her single-minded revenge quest has also cost her dearly even before Ellie enters the picture: we learn via flashbacks that Abby’s inability to let go of hate drove a wedge between her and Owen, the man she loved (he left to pursue a more hopeful life)
denofgeek.com
. In short, Abby begins as someone “consumed with anger and malice”, trapped in a “downward spiral of tragedy and loss” that her own vengeful actions perpetuate
denofgeek.com
. She embodies the cycle of violence at its worst: taking an eye for an eye and causing new grievances (in Ellie) in the process.

 

Crucially, Abby’s arc does not end in that dark place. Over the course of Part II, she undergoes a significant transformation that brings her into accordance with the narrative’s theme of love and empathy overcoming hate. Abby’s turning point comes when she unexpectedly forms a bond with two vulnerable Seraphim siblings, Yara and Lev – members of a group she once saw only as enemies. After Abby rescues Lev (and Yara) and they travel together, Lev’s influence profoundly changes her perspective. Lev is a compassionate, innocent soul who saves Abby’s life and then relies on her, awakening Abby’s long-dormant empathy. As the Den of Geek analysis notes, “in Lev, she finds an opportunity to no longer allow hatred and resentment to lead her life.”
denofgeek.com
 He gives her someone new to care about and atone for. Abby gradually lets go of her black-and-white, hate-fueled mindset and rediscovers a sense of purpose through protecting someone she loves, much like Joel did with Ellie. “You’re my people,” she tenderly tells Lev – a declaration of chosen family and compassion
denofgeek.com
. This is a striking shift for a character who formerly defined people only as allies or targets. Through caring for Lev, Abby begins living according to the theme’s values (love, protection, and understanding) rather than vengeance.

 

Abby’s embrace of empathy culminates in two key moments that demonstrate her full alignment with the theme. First, at the theater showdown in Seattle, Abby has a defeated Ellie (and a pregnant Dina) at her mercy. The old Abby might have killed them in retaliation for her friends Owen and Mel, whom Ellie had slain. Instead, “mercifully, she spares their lives”, breaking the cycle of payback
denofgeek.com
. Prompted by Lev’s presence and moral example, Abby chooses to “end the cycle and let go of her deadly obsession”, walking away instead of indulging in more violence
denofgeek.com
. This mercy is a direct rejection of hatred’s logic and a pivotal moment of forgiveness/forbearance. The second moment comes at the very end: when Ellie later attacks Abby on the Santa Barbara beach, Abby refuses to perpetuate the feud. By this point Abby “has clearly left her hatred behind”
denofgeek.com
. She does not want to fight Ellie at all; she only defends herself when Ellie threatens Lev. Abby’s concern is solely for Lev’s safety, not revenge. Once Ellie releases her, Abby has no desire to continue any vendetta – she simply leaves with Lev to seek a better future. In the end, Abby has transformed into someone who “dedicate[s] her life to protecting and loving Lev”, effectively finding a new family and freedom from the ghosts of her past hatred
denofgeek.com
. Emotionally, she finds closure and hope: we last see Abby heading toward the prospect of joining the Fireflies, a goal symbolizing rekindled hope and community. She is at peace with leaving Joel’s memory behind and focusing on the living person she cares about. In thematic terms, Abby’s arc is a clear embodiment of redemption through love. She starts as the character most violently opposed to the theme’s ideals, and ends as the one who has most actively embraced those ideals, turning away from revenge to show compassion and mercy.

Thematic Alignment Comparison and Conclusion

Considering each character’s trajectory, we can compare how well Joel, Ellie, and Abby fulfill the protagonist’s role of moving from opposition to alignment with the overarching theme:

Joel: Begins Part I as a man who has shut out love and hope, living only for survival (opposed to the theme of love/empathy). Over Part I, he learns to love Ellie like a daughter, regaining his empathy and humanity. By the end, Joel is driven entirely by love – exemplified by saving Ellie at all costs
denofgeek.com
 – thus aligning with the theme of love conquering hate. However, Joel’s arc only partially engages the forgiveness aspect of the theme; he himself was not seeking revenge, and his loving choice inadvertently sparks another’s cycle of vengeance. His development is powerful but morally ambiguous, showing love’s personal redemption while underscoring its complex fallout
denofgeek.com
.

Ellie: Begins as a symbol of innocence and communal good (initially aligned with themes of love/altruism), but after Joel’s death she deviates sharply into opposition. Throughout Part II, Ellie is consumed by hatred and revenge, embodying the very cycle of violence the theme warns against
denofgeek.com
. In the end, she makes a painful pivot back toward the light: she chooses mercy on Abby and decides not to perpetuate the hatred. This final act – prompted by remembering her love for Joel – marks Ellie’s attempt to realign with the theme of forgiveness and empathy
denofgeek.com
. Her arc illustrates a full circle (love → hate → love), though her ultimate emotional resolution is left open-ended. Ellie ends on a path toward living by the theme, but her compliance with it comes at great cost and is only tentative. She begins aligned, falls into opposition, and struggles back to alignment by the finale.

Abby: Begins as the character most firmly opposed to the theme – defined entirely by vengeance and hate from the start of Part II
denofgeek.com
. As her story progresses, Abby undergoes a profound change through her relationship with Lev, finding renewed humanity and compassion. By sparing Ellie and Dina and protecting Lev, Abby decisively breaks the cycle of violence and lives by love rather than hate
denofgeek.com
. In the end, she is the character most clearly living in accordance with the theme: Abby lets go of her blood feud, forgives past grievances (implicitly), and dedicates herself to caring for her new family (Lev) with empathy
denofgeek.com
denofgeek.com
. Her arc is a straightforward transformation from hate to love, with a hopeful resolution.

Ultimately, under the given framework, Abby emerges as the single most thematically aligned protagonist. She starts out furthest from the narrative’s central theme and ends up closest to fully embodying it. Abby’s journey from vengeful assassin to compassionate protector most directly fulfills the criterion of a protagonist who rejects the theme initially and embraces it by the end. While Joel and Ellie are both complex, well-developed characters with significant growth, their arcs have more ambiguity in relation to the theme. Joel finds personal love but ignites a cycle of violence he never reconciles, and Ellie only partially resolves her inner conflict with hate. In contrast, Abby’s arc most completely illustrates the overarching theme of the two-game saga: she overcomes hatred through love and breaks free of the cycle of vengeance in a way that provides a clear emotional resolution. By the story’s conclusion, Abby is living for love rather than hate, making her the most effective protagonist under the lens of thematic alignment

User:


Without changing Joel's or Abby's story details, how could we adjust Ellie's story to make her the most thematically-aligned character while also keeping the game's genre-alignment as an action-game (necessitating Ellie to have a consistent need to face and overcome "enemy" characters)?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


vbnet
Copy code
A. Objective:
   Modify Ellie’s arc so she ends most clearly aligned with the theme (love and empathy breaking the cycle of violence), while preserving the action-oriented demands of the genre (frequent, high-stakes combat with human enemies).

B. Constraints:
   1. Joel’s and Abby’s story beats and transformations must remain unchanged.
   2. Ellie must engage in regular, gameplay-driven confrontations throughout.
   3. The arc must preserve narrative coherence and player emotional investment.

C. Adjustments to Ellie’s Story:

   I. Motivational Shift:
      a. Original: Ellie is driven primarily by revenge.
      b. Revised: Ellie is initially driven by the need to *understand* Joel’s death, then to *prevent others* from being hurt by Abby’s group.
      c. Result: Ellie’s aggression stems not from blind rage but from a distorted sense of justice and protection, allowing room for moral growth without diminishing combat necessity.

   II. Structural Refinement:
      a. Retain combat density and pacing, but intersperse more encounters where Ellie uses stealth, interrogation, or non-lethal subdual to gather information or rescue innocents.
      b. Emphasize ambiguity in enemy roles (e.g., many enemies are also victims of the cycle), offering Ellie moments of recognition, hesitation, or mercy.
      c. Include sections where Ellie chooses to spare enemies mid-combat, reinforcing her internal struggle and gradual return to empathy.

   III. Interpersonal Reframing:
      a. Strengthen Ellie’s bond with Dina as a stabilizing force throughout her journey.
      b. Introduce recurring interactions with a secondary survivor (similar to Lev’s role for Abby) who is tied to one of Abby’s allies but is innocent or morally gray.
      c. Use this relationship to highlight Ellie’s capacity for protection, mentorship, and emotional connection—contrasting with her deteriorating quest.

   IV. Key Climax Modification:
      a. Original: Ellie nearly kills Abby on the beach but relents after a vision of Joel.
      b. Revised: Ellie defeats Abby earlier, but Lev intervenes mid-fight. Ellie realizes Lev mirrors herself and Joel, awakening her buried empathy.
      c. Let Ellie *save* Lev from another attacker or danger immediately after, cementing her pivot from destroyer to protector.

   V. Ending Realignment:
      a. Ellie returns to Jackson or an equivalent space—emotionally wounded but proactive.
      b. She seeks out Dina and begins to make amends, suggesting a new purpose in rebuilding.
      c. Final gameplay segment could feature Ellie defending a vulnerable settlement—not out of vengeance, but out of care—visually echoing Joel’s final stand in Part I.

D. Thematic Outcome:
   Ellie’s revised arc allows her to:
      • Begin in disillusionment and misdirected violence.
      • Wrestle with the moral cost of every enemy encounter.
      • Rediscover her value in protecting life, not avenging death.
      • End as a figure of reclaimed empathy—aligned with the theme,
        while still meeting the genre’s need for sustained, intense conflict.

E. Summary:
   By reframing Ellie’s motivations, humanizing her enemies, incorporating a transformative companion, and giving her a redemptive protective action at the climax, her arc can fulfill the theme’s demand for growth without compromising the game’s identity as an action-driven experience.

Copy code
A. Objective:
   Adjust Ellie’s arc to make her the most thematically-aligned character—beginning in opposition to the theme (consumed by violence) and ending in full alignment (acting from empathy and love)—while maintaining the core structure and mechanics of an action game that requires her to engage frequently with enemies.

B. Constraints:
   1. Joel and Abby’s storylines must remain intact to preserve thematic interweaving and narrative causality.
   2. Ellie must still participate in regular high-intensity combat encounters to satisfy genre expectations and player engagement.
   3. Emotional integrity and character believability must be preserved across the entire arc.

C. Adjustments to Ellie’s Story:

   I. Motivational Shift:
      a. **Original**: Ellie’s quest is almost entirely vengeance-driven following Joel’s death. Her obsession with making Abby suffer overrides all other concerns.
      b. **Revised**: Ellie is still devastated by Joel’s murder, but instead of seeking revenge, her primary stated goal becomes *understanding* why it happened and *preventing similar harm* from befalling others. Her initial objective is inquiry, not retribution.
         - For example, the mission to Seattle could be framed as trying to dismantle a dangerous faction (WLF) that’s spreading unchecked violence and instability.
         - Abby is still her focus, but as a “dangerous person who needs to be stopped,” not as a target of personal hatred.
      c. **Narrative Effect**: This subtle shift allows Ellie’s violence to be framed—at least early on—as protective or investigative rather than purely emotional. This maintains narrative momentum without hard-coding Ellie into thematic opposition from the outset.

   II. Structural Refinement of Combat Encounters:
      a. **Preserve gameplay frequency and intensity**: Ellie still engages in enemy-rich areas requiring stealth, combat, and tactical planning.
      b. **Introduce non-lethal resolution options in key sequences**:
         - Certain enemies surrender or hesitate, offering Ellie the choice to spare or interrogate them.
         - She may encounter fleeing or wounded foes who pose no threat—letting her choose whether to help, ignore, or kill them.
      c. **Combat Dialogue and Environmental Cues**:
         - Let Ellie react dynamically to what enemies say or do (e.g., hearing them mention families or express fear).
         - Show her struggling with her conscience through internal monologue or flashbacks triggered by enemy deaths.
      d. **Narrative Payoff**:
         - These moments of hesitation create contrast with her more brutal actions, emphasizing moral strain.
         - It prepares the player emotionally for Ellie’s eventual pivot back to empathy, making her transformation feel earned.

   III. Interpersonal Reframing:
      a. **Dina’s Role**: Dina becomes a stronger moral anchor for Ellie throughout the journey.
         - Instead of leaving midway through Seattle, Dina continues to travel with Ellie, trying to hold her back from becoming like those she hunts.
         - They argue about morality, vengeance, and Joel, which adds emotional and philosophical depth to Ellie’s choices.
      b. **Introduce a Transformative Companion (e.g., a young survivor)**:
         - Ellie could meet a vulnerable character tied to the WLF or Seraphites—someone she initially distrusts or treats as collateral.
         - Over time, she grows to protect them, drawing parallels between herself and Joel or Abby.
         - This character becomes her moral mirror, forcing Ellie to confront what she’s become and what she values.
      c. **Narrative Impact**:
         - By seeing someone else go through the early stages of her own trauma, Ellie is able to reclaim her humanity.
         - The companion functions as a humanizing presence and motivator for her shift from destroyer to protector.

   IV. Climax Revision – Santa Barbara Beach Scene:
      a. **Original**: Ellie confronts a starved, broken Abby and nearly drowns her, only to stop after a vision of Joel.
      b. **Revised**: Ellie finds and defeats Abby in combat, but before she delivers the killing blow, Lev intervenes. 
         - In the confrontation, Lev begs her to stop or tries to protect Abby, mirroring Ellie’s own past experiences.
         - The emotional flashpoint becomes not Joel’s memory but Lev’s presence—reminding Ellie of what love and protection truly mean.
         - Ellie instinctively shifts from vengeance to compassion and helps Lev (e.g., shielding him from danger or saving him from a remaining captor).
      c. **Narrative Effect**:
         - This climax makes Ellie’s final moral pivot active and participatory—not just a withdrawal from violence, but an embrace of care.
         - It reinforces the theme more forcefully: empathy breaks the cycle of hate, and Ellie’s choice saves a life rather than takes one.

   V. Reimagined Ending:
      a. **Ellie’s Return**:
         - Ellie comes back to the farmhouse and finds Dina and JJ gone, as in the original.
         - However, she does not collapse into despair—instead, she begins rebuilding. Perhaps she repairs the house or ventures into Jackson to reconcile.
      b. **Final Gameplay Segment (Optional)**:
         - A short epilogue mission places Ellie in a protector role—defending a settlement or helping a group of survivors.
         - The combat is still intense, but now it’s clearly in the service of others, not her own vendetta.
      c. **Narrative Message**:
         - This final act cements Ellie’s transformation. Her actions are no longer reactive or fueled by anger but proactive and rooted in care.
         - Symbolic gestures (e.g., returning the guitar, helping a child, or leaving a carving for Joel) reinforce closure without erasing trauma.

D. Thematic Outcome:
   Ellie’s arc now adheres to the theme with clarity and conviction:
      • Her violence is contextualized by moral uncertainty and a desire to prevent further harm.
      • Her emotional breakdown is offset by her growing empathy and reluctant compassion.
      • Her final act is not just one of abstaining from revenge but of embracing moral action rooted in love.

E. Summary:
   Through:
      - Reframing Ellie’s motivation,
      - Embedding moral ambiguity in combat,
      - Elevating her relationship with a vulnerable companion,
      - Reconstructing the climax around active empathy,
      - And reinforcing redemptive action in the ending—
   Ellie’s arc becomes the most clearly thematic in the narrative.
   This preserves the intensity and brutality expected of an action game,
   while ensuring the player experiences a protagonist who fully embodies
   the story’s deepest moral message by journey’s end.
