Roxy guys preps ah High School where the
place you sit that dictates your social
status in the classroom the smart kit
sits in the front the slacker in the
back and your crush is probably sitting
just close enough to make things awkward
but there's a much more important
seating chart to abide by the cafeteria
don't be fooled by the open seats
whether you're poking at mashed potatoes
indoors or lounging around outside
everyone reports to his or her
respective Clicks in an orderly fashion
and no click shall cross paths with one
another that is the Lana's group over
there they do the TV station they think
that's the most important thing on earth
and that's the Persian Mafia you can't
hang with them unless you in a BMW
number nine the bathroom why do you hate
her what do you mean Regina you seem to
really hate her yes what's your question
if movies have taught us anything it's
that the bathroom especially the high
school bathroom is a magical place where
the most necessary conversations take
place it's the go-to spot for True high
school camaraderie or a place to talk to
friends about potential love interests
it's especially great for bitching about
someone you don't like or having caddy
conversations about a student who
unbeknownst to us is in the bathroom
stall behind us she was never attacked I
think she made it all up why would she
lie about it for attention the girl has
some serious issues did we mention that
the bathroom doubles as a place to have
an emotional breakdown don't worry your
insecurities are safe within those tiled
walls I want every detail R now [ __ ]
number eight the one inspirational SL
cool teach
Hey listen nobody's forcing you to be
here you have a choice you can
stay or you can leave lady why are you
playing this game there can be only one
no seriously there's always only one
teacher we can relate to all high school
movie teachers are so unbearable that
it's hard to believe they're allowed to
keep their job study hard and you will
be rewarded fail to do so and the
consequences may be severe that's why we
cling to the one good one this is the
teacher who inspires us to better
ourselves the teacher who's willing to
take a chance on his or her students the
people who choose to get on that bus
which are you are the people who are
saying I will not carry myself down to
die when I go to my grave my head will
be high they may try a bit too hard at
first so much so that it's either
hilarious or cringeworthy but by the end
of the movie they've uplifted us
all captain my captain sit down Mr
Anderson
you hear me sit down sit down number
seven who's the new kid in town nice try
freshman sure we're all the new kid on
the first day of school and go through
the everyday stigma but then there's the
new kid this particular breed of new kid
comes in a variety of flavors how can
you say that she's totally what are you
talking about there's more to her than
you think there's the new to the city
kid the I'm going to be popular
and or date someone popular kid the not
really new but leaves an impression on
the first day kid and the Mysterious new
kid who shows up mid-semester who's
either dropped at gorgeous or has rumors
circulating about why he or she
transferred schools Mr Spicoli that's
the name they gave
me hey you ripping my car
yeah hey bud what's your problem
whatever the case they're new and they
must be in investigated immediately so
this must be the elusive Christian where
should I park number six Larger than
Life bullies if you're going to openly
be a [ __ ] it's just Heather why can't
we talk to different kinds of people Me
Gently with the chainsaw do I look like
Mother Teresa if I did I probably
wouldn't mind talking to The Geek Squad
if you thought the bullies in junior
high were terrifying wait until you meet
the high school movie bullies that's not
to say that bullying isn't a serious
issue but movie bullies are so over the
top that they should probably have a
segment on America's Most Wanted so
what's up to you
butthead you know you've been looking
for
a this goes beyond name calling and
knocking over someone's books movie
bullies have a frightening blood lust
and an alarming amount of support while
it's important to stand up for yourself
it's hard to believe that the adults in
these movies would let anyone get away
with this kind of brutality
number five bye-bye bye virginity no
longer will our penises remain flaccid
and unused we will fight for every man
out there who isn't getting late and
should be have you had sex yet you
better get on that right away especially
if you're in high school uh we should
probably clarify what we mean according
to the movies High School is the peak
time to lose that pesky virginity
because being a virgin is completely
Blasphemous I was like why am I even
listening to you to begin with you're a
virgin who can't drive characters will
go through incredible lengths to not
only get to the bedroom but they'll also
practice in comically bizarre ways the
resulting sex can range from painfully
awkward surprisingly good if your
partner is whom you least expect it to
be or heart meltingly romantic yeah
number four senior year is the Year
Cameron fry this one's for
[Music]
you getting married having children
getting your dream job purchasing your
first home none of those things matter
the most important moment in our lives
is senior year more specifically our
senior year in high school okay
girls let's go go get
him essentially senior year is the last
year of our lives so we have to do the
absolute most before we walk across that
stage your crush tell them your feelings
your parents stop letting them dictate
your life save it dad save it save what
you got the opportunity of a lifetime
West Kanan is not the opportunity of a
LIF time your friends spend every last
minute with them because you'll never
see them again life ends After High
School school until college but that's
another story thanks
[Music]
guys number three the makeover for the
nerdy
girl that's
it I did it I'm a miracle worker GH
nerdy girls are the worst what with
their glasses and um wait what's wrong
with nerdy girls again
[Music]
Sandy tell me about it when it comes to
the bottom of the high school Barrel
nerdy girls are squished into the
dustiest of Corners until the popular
girls get a hold of them or the jocks
make a random bet their male
counterparts will most likely crawl out
of the barrel without the need of that
all important makeover unless that
makeover comes from a radioactive spider
youer yeah are you all right
uh I'm fine on rare occasions the nerdy
girl is kept intact but that's usually
because she did something one time in
band camp oh and this one time at band
camp I stuck a flute in
my number two the sports star and the
cheerleader let's go
to all right we're sweet they're the
ultimate High School power couple
whether they stay together or not is IR
relevant just know that at some point
the captain of the team and head
cheerleader were an item or they were at
least lusting after each other he's
either an incredibly dumb jock or an
attractive douchebag while she's either
a shallow dits with the heart of gold or
a certified mean girl who gets her come
upin even if it takes a decade together
this couple will always be the main
character's lovable dumb friends or
their worst nightmare there is no in
between hi Dad hi Jake I love he does
with his eyebrows before the bell rings

oh I know what's coming next
I knew it welcome to watchmojo.com and
today we'll be counting down our top 10
horror movie cliches getting another
beer you want one yeah sure I'll be
right since this is a horror list please
be advised that it contains mature
content number 10 nudity and sex equal
death let's kick off our list with the
cliche that's probably the greatest
reason many of us enjoy watching gore
fests to begin with horror films always
have people specifically young adults
getting it on and baring it all not just
eye candy it mirrors team fears about
sexuality as a result most horror flicks
push the parent approve message of a
students don't believe us then why does
the film's always blonde quote unquote
poor get axed and the prudish but keen
minded lunette always survive gave it up
now you no longer die those are the
rules number nine the black character
always dies if you think promiscuous
blondes have it bad
well the non-white character is even
more likely to meet their bloody end
before the credits roll while there are
so few non-white characters to begin
with they're always stuck playing the
second fiddle as the best friend no
matter their part in the story these
characters seem to exist to fill in a
stereotype until the monster or murderer
affirmative ly actions them out of
commission
[Applause]
number eight hiding from death it's the
point they're all the same some stupid
killer stalking some big-breasted girl
who panicked who's always running up the
stairs when she should be going out the
front door it's insulting now that we've
discussed the cliches as to who will die
first let's take a look at how they die
namely cornering themselves by trying to
hide like children specifically under
the bed in the closet or by running
upstairs we get it they're scared but a
game of hide-and-seek is not likely to
tire out undead killers or vicious space
aliens now is it what they should really
do is get the hell out there seems to be
only one way out of a hiding place and
that is in a body bag
number seven two left feet
sometimes the victims do decide to run
assuming they can escape their hiding
place and power to them the problem is
that this brings up another horror movie
cliche it seems that no movie character
is capable of running more than a dozen
feet without face-planting equally
cliche is the fact that the sprint
doesn't give them any distance over the
attacker he's almost always walking how
does Jason ever get anywhere at that
pace
[Music]
number six knives only is there no fifth
amendment in the United States of the
horror movie world save for zombie films
granted it's called the slasher genre
for a reason
this means that it's not likely for
anyone to be taken down by lead leaving
steel as the leading cause of boo-boos
why doesn't anyone ever own a gun a
notable exception to this cliche is the
police but that never does in many
favors either number 5 inept authorities
carrying on that thought from the last
entry this cliche has been established
for so long that we don't even ask
ourselves why people don't run to the
police anymore
we expect that anyone with a badge might
as well have a target on their backs as
the killer likes to take him out with
extreme prejudice
same thing goes for the brave member of
the group who always winds up not as
alive as he started number four also
scares everyone knows that the first
half hour or so of a horror film is all
build up and it's too early for anyone
to bite the dust with the exception of
the opening ten minutes to keep up the
tension fake scares are sprinkled in to
keep us guessing and use near the end to
keep us paying attention just think of
how many times characters bump into each
other and that sharp sound kicks you in
the ass number three middle of nowhere
the only war films to take place in open
environments or at the mall have zombies
there's no other way to put it the
reason for isolated and creepy locations
is simple it allows the story to cut the
victims off from society and takes the
characters and in turn the viewers out
of their comfort zones these abandoned
settings are a character in and of
themselves and we don't see them
disappearing any time soon
[Music]
number two let's split up to make sure
this place is safe let's see if the
doors over this way I walk down there
maybe I'll show you regret on that
direction check for if there's one thing
we wouldn't do if we were stalked by a
blade carrying psychopath it would be
split up why make it easier to get off
one by one
I guess that removes a lot of the
suspense and adds a sense of
vulnerability but isn't there a way to
force the members to split off rather
than have them randomly scatter like
cockroaches when the lights turn on we
should split up you can cover more
ground that way yeah yeah good idea
really number one why won't he die
[Music]
taking the top spot on our list is the
cliche that all horror villains have to
come back again after being killed for
an encore
moreover they always somehow survived
leaving the door open for a possible
sequel we get it they want viewers to
relax before cranking the terror dial to
11 and that it's not a satisfying ending
unless the bad guy goes down hard and
it's gotten so bad that we can't even
take most killers seriously anymore this
is the moment when the supposedly dead
killer comes back to life for one last
scare agree with our list what do you
consider to be the most overdone horror
movie cliche for more entertaining top

In like entertainment and movies and all that kinda stuff.

I can't stand the fact

with such a variety of unique characters
and compelling storylines to choose from
why do most superhero movies end up
looking rather similar alright listen up
welcome to watchmojo.com and today we're
counting down our picks for the top 10
superhero movie cliches for this list
we're looking at the most common cliches
found in superhero movies number 10 a
city is destroyed in a large battle the
hero is supposed to save the world from
the evil villain who wants to destroy
the planet yet more often than not a
city is absolutely leveled during a
climactic battle that would likely
result in hundreds of deaths and
millions of dollars worth of damages
we see this in the Incredible Hulk The
Avengers the x-men last stand but the
worst culprit has to be Man of Steel
disaster experts at Watson technical
consulting estimated that 129 thousand
people would have been killed and there
would have been over 700 billion in
damages Superman is Earth's Savior are
they gone I think so saved us number 9
the villain is a science experiment gone
wrong tonight you're all gonna be a part
of a social experiment sure we know it
can be difficult to come up with ways
for a person to gain superpowers
but why does it always have to be
science related dosage has been
increased to 200 milligrams the worst
offender of this cliche is the
spider-man franchise the Green Goblin
Doc Ock and the lizard were all
promising scientists before their
experiments went horribly horribly wrong
ladies and gentlemen
fasten your seatbelts we also see
villains emerge from scientific
experiments in the Incredible Hulk and
Iron Man 3 how about more villains like
the Joker who are just evil for the sake
of being evil
introduce a little anarchy everything
becomes number-8 convenient connections
between all the main characters
sometimes you know people there are over
7 billion people in the world and there
are way more across the galaxy if you
include all the other planets in the
comic book universe yet most superhero
movies tend to revolve around a small
group of characters that are all
connected somehow Peter Parker for
example in the amazing spider-man Peter
fights dr. Curt Connors the mentor to
his girlfriend Gwen Stacy whose father
is the police captain who helps Peter a
Spidey in his fight at the end of the
film your boyfriend is a man of many
masks I get it
Connors was also the partner of Peter's
father Richard Parker before he
disappeared here that is some guy I work
with you Dan I guess number 7 cops are
against the hero this is one of the more
understandable cliches on the list but
it's a cliche nonetheless official
policy is to arrest the vigilante known
as Batman on-site if a strange person
showed up with the ability to shoot webs
or turn into a Green Giant there's a
strong chance the police force and
military would take every necessary
precaution president could declare a
state of emergency place every mutant in
the country under arrest
still after seeing it in the spider-man
Batman and x-men franchises it's
starting to become dull watching the
hero have to explain to the cops that
he's actually on their side every time
drop the knives and put your hands in
the air
number 6 pep talk
with great power comes great
responsibility no matter how powerful or
strong-minded the hero is it always
seems that he needs a pep talk at some
point typically from an older wiser
figure some men just want to watch the
world but the most obvious examples
being Uncle Ben and Alfred with great
power comes great responsibility a pep
talk can also be given by the leader of
a team like Nick Fury who uses Phil
Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers
Phil Coulson died still believing in
that idea in heroes and Peter quill aka
star-lord in guardians of the galaxy I
for one am NOT gonna stand by and watch
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent
lives isn't it inspiring enough that you
have to save the world no high two for
it but that's the point of Batman number
five the origin story
sometimes we don't need to know where
the characters come from in order to
appreciate them now gaaah founders time
ask like Constantinople or Rome or
before it the city has become a breeding
ground for suffering and injustice more
often than not the origin story bonds
down a film case in point
do we really need to see a spider bite
Peter Parker again it's much more
entertaining to see spider-man swinging
around New York City than it is to watch
Peter Parker get picked on at high
school there's a reason why films where
the hero is already established are some
of the most critically successful
superhero movies you'd have another
father to give you another name and he
sent you here for a reason Clark number
four hidden identity I'm spider-man this
cliche primarily applies to be
spider-man and Batman franchises and
seeing as it seems incredibly easy for
people to figure out that Peter Parker
is spider-man we are primarily
referencing Batman whoa
Bruce Wayne seriously would it have
really mattered if James Gordon knew
that Batman was Bruce Wayne Bruce Wayne
even more shocking he couldn't figure it
out until the last movie while
protecting a secret identity helps to
add drama to the film it doesn't seem
like it's all that practical who are you
a friend everyone knows who the Avengers
are and they seem to manage just fine
number three villain explains master
plan to the hero it occurs to me that a
500 Megaton bomb planted at just the
proper point would would destroy most of
California why does the villain have to
explain everything to the hero before
killing them or failing to kill him this
is a common cliche of the Banjara but
it's found in superhero movies as well
Bechet arya coming nothing will change
that
what have I to fear Lex Luthor is
perhaps the best example as he reveals
to Superman that there are in fact two
missiles headed for the United States a
plan Superman eventually foils after
escaping from Luthor's underground lair
yes Superman double jeopardy even you
with your great speed couldn't stop both
of them this cliche has actually been
manipulated by other films as well like
Sin City when senator Roark explains the
entire plan to Hartigan feeling full
well then can't do anything to stop it
but I heard you firm and fit healthy I'm
even putting up cash of my own to get
you more surgery fix that heart
condition of yours you're gonna keep on
living a long time I'll make sure that
number two love interest is kidnapped
hello yeah as if the stakes weren't high
enough the heroes love interest always
seems to be kidnapped by the villain Let
Die the woman you love Mary Jane Watson
Wednesday see Rachel Dawes Pepper Potts
and Nancy Callahan are just some of the
numerous characters to play the damsel
in distress roll clever girl
so pretty so pretty unless a female
character has superpowers
it seems that all they're good for is
getting captured what's actually more
embarrassing than that
your here's my charlie Christopher Nolan
at least played on this cliche by having
Batman failed to save Rachel during the
Dark Knight well Quinn Stacy actually
assisted spider-man in his battle versus
the lizard in the amazing spider-man
before we unveil our number one pick
here are a few honorable mentions
and Hulk smash
it's character to start we don't know
what have happened
number one traumatic childhood it seems
that all superheroes are inspired at a
young age to fight crime because they
experienced some sort of traumatic event
during their childhood
the most common cliche is the death of a
parent or parental figure Ben Thomas and
Martha Wayne Uncle Ben and Jonathan Kent
are just some of the many examples we
also learned that magneto lived in a
concentration camp during World War two
while Matt Murdock aka daredevil was
blinded at a young age can't someone who
had a happy childhood gain superpowers
and still be motivated enough to save
the world do you agree with our list
what's your favorite superhero movie
cliche I don't mean the lecture and I
don't mean the preach for more super top

[Music]
you watch as many action movies as we do
patterns begin to emerge some we hate
some we like some we can't live without
stick around
welcome to watchmojo.com and today we're
counting down our top 10 essential
action movie cliches let's play
number 10 trigger happy
no matter what the circumstance it seems
as though the heroes always have the
upper hand in a firefight they dispatch
enemies with these while the countless
baddies seem unable to hit the broadside
of a barn number nine everything goes
boom
as everyone knows cars are highly
volatile machines seemingly made of
tissue paper birch bark and lighter
fluid
[Music]
or so you would think by how often
easily and massively they explode
explosions are awesome so if only more
stuff went boom with such gusto number
eight what explosion Roger Ebert long to
moaned the cliche of humans outrunning
fire I thought this looks like your work
let's go a friggin eeeh but even more
ridiculous is the hero seemingly not
noticing a huge explosion occurring
directly behind him as it caresses his
buttocks with gentle work
look it up that is the definition with
that axe cop [ __ ] on that number
seven something to live for
the worst thing to have in an action
movie is something to live for having
any plans means that you're already
beyond saving and might as well have a
crosshair on your back I'm too old for
this [ __ ] don't even think about
mentioning retirement this is a cliche
perfectly distilled in the Simpsons for
just christened a boat yes sir
everything's gonna be just number six
just a flesh wound while action movies
play loose with the laws of physics they
play even looser with biology yes this
face Oh Arnie sly and Bruce can
seemingly shake off any sort of physical
trauma as a simple flesh fool simply put
it would be pretty lame if bullet wounds
or cuts caused them to stop fighting I
don't know look for a sterile bandage or
seek out hospital care good adjacent
buddy
number five for info European bad guys
aren't just for James Bond films anymore
who is the dick is now having a foreign
accent appears to be pretty much a
mandatory requirement at terrorist
school Caesarea Terriers this is
especially true if a bad guy plans on
being taken seriously at all
by hero or authorities one ton of that
key to million of your people will die
instantly
what case that's key who's taken the key
number for personal vendettas gonna
squeeze them till they give them up yeah
right you do that all right
this means it's gonna find Richie you
know that money and terrorism are strong
motivations for downright nasty actions
not daddy however a personal touch
like targeting the hero's family always
adds that deeper dimension Bennett stop
screwing around and let the girl go this
often makes for bad guys that are just
so bad
they gotta be killed with bare hands cuz
this time it's personal
that's a shame of course those bullets
just saved you a lot of pain
number three saving the bad guy
[Music]
despite what some might argue it's hard
to claim that you're a good guy once you
kill a criminal you could have easily
apprehended just in case you forgot
who's got the moral high ground in these
flicks most action heroes make an
attempt to save the villain before that
backfires number two bad guys always die
everything is better with an explosive
encore and because of this it's an
expectation that the hero won't get off
easy
[Music]
sure you can walk away from explosions
but you better take a minute to make
sure that his enemy isn't just playing
dead interestingly a side effect of this
is that films that skirt this particular
cliche often feel disappointing or
somehow incomplete
[Music]
remember Sally when I promised to kill
you last number one killer one-liners
are alive here it is our favorite cliche
let off some steam Bennett
if Arnie and company have taught us
anything it's that the best way to
dispatch a villain isn't with lead or
the law nope it's by giving them a
zinger that they would never forget had
they survived no jumbo do you agree with
our list is there an action movie cliche
that gets your blood pumping let us know
in the comment section and for more
adrenaline-fueled top 10s

(We’re going to dig into misconceptions about Hawaii and Hawaiians, but we’ll treat them as if they are film cliches about the same; incorporate them into the list as such)

everybody else gone this is Jail so
tapering go ahead make this video to
talk about the misconceptions about
Hawaii so there's a lot of things that
people
believe are true about Hawaii and smooth
are true
for example
have you been to a little love you
wonder like you go to outlaw time you
guys know how every weekend you know a
luau is basically a wine party okay emu
is where they would like a wok oven
complete with smoke a bigger whatever's
for dinner
but most people in Hawaii do not
actually good ones the Liao's are most
commonly practiced viruses so it's they
found a way to have a party
themed in Hawaiian Hawaiian themed party
in sell tickets
most families wine families local
families they do get together there's a
very strong family imbibed in Hawaii and
that's nice to see it's refreshing right
but I don't think they call blue elves I
don't even think they really have a name
form more than anything they just kind
of get together you know go to the beach
and you know that's why there's so many
cabanas the whole family will go and the
barbecue and cooking so I can have fun
and just fellowship with each other as
family members but the luau you know
people doing hula and dancing and all
that
that's resource
next thing is let's just talk about
these Hawaiian shirts aloha shirts so
for really I know I wear these a lot
right more often than not that's not
really a
Hawaiian thing it's more but I
guess I could say it's an ally thing
most locals they don't really wear
Hawaiian shirts either I mean some of
the some of the older guys they do but
most of the younger generation you know
they wear board shorts flip-flops
some rash guard or some sure like that
hang table but that's the local where
but you know guys like me I guess and I
say guys like me I me my guys who work
in a more business environment sometimes
this is more the preferred attire to a
student I
for example banks Hawaiian Bank thankful
why it's pretty nice
everyone serves you know they say all
you from will want to use Hawaii you
must serve every day a lot of people do
serve a lot of people do body board but
not everybody doesn't forget there at
the lumpy even babies yes not everybody
okay another misconception
I'm
moving to Hawaii get away from the rat
race
how thank you very from the rat race no
more here that you could in the
suburbs of Chicago or Kentucky I always
say Kentucky right but
you know Florida or any other suburban
community rural community so to say I
mean you got a big city in Honolulu or
lock traffic you're going to be stuck in
traffic like a son of a gun here a lot
it's all over that on gridlock you hear
on Big Island now he gets it I mean
every island gets that gridlock traffic
you know so you just got to just got to
deal with it
yeah not everybody who lives in Hawaii
here is Hawaii residents such as myself
as a Hawaiian
Hawaiian indigenous person gonna beat
somebody who
family plinian States back generations
and actually not too many Hawaiians
really are you know full-blooded wines
really are here right now I mean a lot
of the Pacific island people come from
like Marquesas well Micronesia
Philippines and just other places
obviously so American European
get a whole Latino communities
it's a melting pot just like anywhere
else any other Koreans Japanese
[Music]
oh
no you don't need a passport when you're
coming here okay
don't need an international phone plan
when you're coming here okay so because
even my friends they've been like so I
need a passport to go to Hawaii no it's
a state I know a lot of you're like oh
yeah why is so I guess I don't
okay spam it's what's for dinner
every one things like when you come to
Hawaii that everyone eats like so
healthy like not some fruits on trees
and we just go in our backyards and just
pull coconuts out a tree and just drink
coconuts out of the coconut water out of
coconut and you know eat mangos all the
time and papayas and bananas all that
stuff right and just catch our own food
all that well the truth is most of our
food is imported from other places and
spam is probably the most consumed
consumed food item
okay is a great food item seafood there
is aji and mahi mahi in boy and you know
there's other delicacies that you know
people have that the put spam has hit
spam number one I mean they got they got
spicy spam
all trips to space pronouncing barbecue
spam in Sai mean the list goes on name
it they got lemon spawn spam
all right here's one it's my
server one live on the Big Island the
big dollars made on
the main islands of the wall those lands
together with Ron Lewis and they have a
nice population they got has the third
largest population now the second third
largest population
but yeah most of the people are on the
wall
yeah you don't get international client
if there's other things yeah oh
how about this I'm gonna ghost why get
away from the cold well guess what it
does snow on bigger it does get pain
cold upon alcohol on Maui
up in the higher countries on all
Islands it gets a little bit chilly
even Kauai she loved in Waimea Canyon
I'll start right in and be like cool was
cold right
Monica gets cold you better bring your
windbreaker leave up there a
lot of people think that moving Hawaii
is going to fix a lot of their
problems and just again and goes back to
no I'm different than anywhere else I
mean does your quality of life improve
if you're into these kinds of things
that they practice at Hawaii yeah but do
your problems just magically go away and
I think that has really emphasized
because people think that this knots are
magic
that's involved in healing or something
doesn't know why and I don't think
that's sure I think maybe there can be
some truth to an environment in wine
for example looking onto a very
beautiful climate a very beautiful
setting just like if you were to do that
in California or New York or Florida or
Panama Costa Rica Japan you know that
can be said but just moving in Hawaii to
let me know your stress anxiety to
dissolve Sun no magically in first
people thankful is it I mean some people
have said they went to Y with all types
of different problems in their mind and
they came back change perfect persons
sure maybe
everyone speaks I
missed one not very many people do speak
common that the locals would be pigeon
it's
saying auntie uncle's
this you know it's one of those
not elack's there
it's funny you know like instead of
saying if I go a cherry brown cherry
means like that's you know that's primo
that's good that's as long the kind
that kind of stuff
[Music]
it's like a fashion style it's kind of
faster
inside of that moving over surfing said
that everyone serves
in this day and age people want to know
about lilo and stitch or Moana Maui and
yet again that's just a thing say this
US made popular by the media it's not
really like people who over here they
probably didn't even know who Mawlana
was or Moana is or you know until they
make a movie about it
maybe some people do but
I would say
then there's some superstitions that
have been carried on for generations and
I've talked to someone
they'll even say yeah there were
superstitions but back in the old days
Hawaiians used to believe that
something bad happened it was because
they did something so looks like curse
testing
that was how they viewed the logs paleis
I'm not saying the science is all
figured out by stretching NASA nation
but one thing that would happen was the
snobs they happened to 1946 and in
1963 you know in this day and age the
effects of a tsunami would not be as
impactful as it would have been Bend and
those two eras because we have now
advanced warning systems so
could you still say that there were like
that way that that jutsu not that that's
not that earthquake that happens in
Chile is that sends the shock wave over
thousands of miles to hit everything in
its path because something some people
were doing in Hawaiian curse and entity
you know so science kind of brings a
little bit more breathe into it and
especially with the advanced reason or
advanced
warning so the the gods stuff like Pele
and doesn't the other stuff
it is like a superstition it's got like
a
same as like a leprechaun you know and
very here something like this it's a not
saying that not disrespecting leaves in
that I'm saying that to put your faith
in it
would be no different than if you were
to put your faith in something
some other belief system leprechaun like
elect leprechaun rabbit fluid or a
shamrock or something like this just
kind of it is a superstition your
superstitions can be for luck or for you
know other things so to to I guess I'm
saying this so that when you come over
here you're not just like you said and I
don't send you like cure all these
stories in Linux are sleeping in then
you subscribe to it and you put all your
faith into it find out you know just
like horoscopes writer astrology or
anything really any
belief system that has some sort of
superstitious element to it I think all
religions have been guilty of that so is
it is it
add the people who even enter still
subscribe to know because they have
their rights to freedom of religion and
I think that you can learn a lot from
listening to them doesn't mean that it's
necessarily something that you have to
just believe in because all of a sudden
you came to Hawaii and now that you have
to believe in Pele
it's up to you but
something some food for thought
you know it's like if you remove a lava
brighter you get curse
I've heard people said they have brought
Louisville back didn't they land enough
to happen in the number people sale we
brought a love rock and return agendas
man
says here here's just an arson three and
why there's a popular belief the people
who take lava rock book out National
Park and become cursed by the point
God's plan are failing
according to $1.00 in daily lives and
volcano on Big Island and it's extremely
vengeful being there also love rods
melted board office all the time by to
where she claimed to have had bad luck
after taking off Lanza was still with
the curse sacrificed fiction
he says it's right here says it was made
of a park ranger says first of all you
want a souvenir from why please don't
take long from the National Park from
out rock from the National Park illegal
as for the Hawaiian lava walkers don't
worry it's 100 percent not sure
so you know
it's yet again in superstitions that can
be made up by just any old person who
makes it up and then never tells people
they just made stuff
like an assumption about something so
you know there's there's just a lot of
things to keep in mind oh
it's like are there white sand beaches
everywhere are we to paradise all over
no I like with on the plane the other
day and this lady she she's like she's
like hey Debbie that's that my friend
she goes hey Debbie that's you know
that's actually lava rock and then some
people look around I
only thought it was mud but that's at
the colony Airport it's just one big
giant lava field that just shimmers
really shiny black because there's no
trees or vegetation for miles
she thought it was old mud
there's La Perla but you know a lot of
the islands are very arid sound like
you're and it's like jumbled all the
time this tropical paradise sure does
this that way not all
Kona's very arid Kia's grizzly look very
Herod was just a lot of places that
doesn't rain very often so not every not
every place is just one rain forest I'm
going to Hawaii right so
that's pretty much the gist of this

aloha everyone in this video we're gonna
go over a topic that i do get asked
about a lot from my military families or
clients from the mainland and that is do
locals
really hate newcomers
so i'm just gonna riff a little bit
about what i think makes me well
qualified to talk about this subject and
that is
my background is that i was born in
florida i lived on the mainland my dad
is from hawaii
hawaiian guy but my mom is from a deep
southern florida family and so i grew up
kind of in two worlds like there were a
few brown people
and there are a lot of not brown people
i started coming to hawaii when i was
nine years old and then i i got off the
plane and people are wearing slippers
and
surf shorts and they talk different hey
how's it hello
oh hey how's it bro hey how's it doing
good everyone's cool everyone's
waving hi they look like me it was
pretty cool so when i was a kid i come
to hawaii
and after a few visits i actually stayed
so i stayed here with my father
but i didn't sound like how i talk right
now
like you know like a hawaiian accent no
i didn't sound like that right when i
started school here
intermediate school which is what they
call you know middle schools here that
only have seventh and eighth grade so
when i started intermediate school here
in hawaii i still had a southern accent
from florida
one of the girls that ended up being
good friends with throughout high school
i remember her teasing me when i first
came to hawaii she's like oh bro
you look like us but you talk funny
where are you from
and so they used to you know tease me a
little bit but after
a few months and by the time you know a
year had gone by
everyone forgot i was from the mainland
and i
sounded like them you may not look like
you're from here so are you going to
have problems with local people
it's just like anywhere there's
different levels of
education and socioeconomic status
and maybe generational pain
from poverty after past events in 1893
the hawaiian kingdom began to get
overthrown
and so there's still some lasting
effects from that time period
additionally in the 1800s we had tons of
plantation there were
first generation from japan china
philippines believe it or not we have a
puerto rican community here in hawaii
portuguese community with all of these
cultures combined we have a really
unique culture here in hawaii one of the
things i said in my last video was that
we're not only geographically halfway to
the east
but we're kind of culturally halfway to
the east so my tip for you is
if you were to go to japan you wouldn't
expect to bring your
boston or texas or california habits and
culture with you
you would assimilate whether it be for
your two weeks or your two years
you would assimilate to their culture
bring that same attitude here to hawaii
and as long as you show respect
i tend to find that people have a good
experience and they enjoy paradise so
when you're coming to hawaii just
remember that it's a unique culture
and people are different japanese
filipino hawaiian portuguese and the mom
is from texas
that's a common thing here and they have
different customs it's not uh
normal to stare here so you may be
curious and you wanna you're looking at
someone
do i know you but that may offend them
don't drive aggressively here in hawaii
we have a deep culture of respect if you
just
overtake someone and zoom past them on
the road that can be seen
as a real sign of disrespect if someone
lets you in in traffic
make sure you acknowledge it and say
thank you chances are they're gonna say
thank you back you know basically said
they're happy to do it do locals dislike
newcomers
i don't think so as with everywhere
there's different levels of education
different levels of socioeconomic status
you're going to get a different
experience depending on where you are on
the island and what kind of people you
surround yourself with
but i can tell you this i have family on
the west side of this island
who there's several people that live in
the house they don't have a ton of money
but i can tell you
if you were hungry and you were outside
and you were their neighbor
they'd feed you from their plate they
give you food even though they don't
know when the next paycheck's coming
we also have a thing called aloha and i
suggest you get to know what aloha means
and i'll try to help get you started
aloha is a unique
uh version of maybe southern hospitality
but it means more than that aloha means
love
aloha means respect aloha means
gratitude it means all things positive
so if you come to hawaii and you begin
to learn and respect the culture here
even adopt some of the things that we do
here such as
in hawaii you take your shoes off in the
house and if you don't take your shoes
off before you go into the house
that could be seen as a sign of
disrespect so there are nuances to this
culture
long and short i do not think that local
people hate
or dislike people from the mainland i
think that
there is some history where that
paradigm exists
but anytime that i've seen someone from
the mainland show respect
and show gratitude show aloha they tend
to do okay
and are you going to have some bad
apples anywhere you go yeah i've
experienced it from my time being
stationed in florida and virginia and
california
things can happen anywhere but on
average if you're respectful
you learn what aloha means and you learn
how to
act with aloha and give aloha then i
think you're gonna
love hawaii

welcome to the maolalo channel
let's get right into it number six
hawaiian women in the kingdom could not
vote so the constitution
and the country was sexist while it's
technically true women couldn't vote
this needs to be put into context
lunalilla was thinking of universal
suffrage by the early
1870s and did not live long enough to
achieve it
had he lived longer hawaii may have been
the first country to grant women the
right to vote
because the first official country to do
so was new zealand in 1893.
in fact women in the hawaii legislature
the house of nobles could vote as early
as 1840.
number seven missionaries overthrew hoy
anyone who knows their hawaiian history
well at all knows this isn't true
not technically none of the leaders of
the overthrow were themselves
missionaries
they were the sons and grandsons of
missionaries now often called
the mission boys the boys of the
missionaries
and colloquially missionaries
but none of them were actually
missionaries because that wasn't the
thing to do in their generation
they all became businessmen in sugar and
related industries
a related misconception is that
missionaries helped abolish
the kapu system since they were climbing
aboard a ship in boston harbor when that
happened
it's impossible for them to have done so
[Music]
number eight this is a pretty
well known to be false by now but it's
worth remembering that in the
1980s hanani k trask had to defend the
idea
that the hawaiian resistance occurred
and could only refer to the lyrics of
kawlan
in support of the idea now with the coup
a petitions
we see that not only did hawaiians
resist they resisted non-violently and
violently with the wilcox rebellion in
other words
hawaiians did everything possible to
prevent annexation
number nine hawaiians lost their land in
the mahele
my own research as well as that of
others like donovan prezza
robert stauffer and keanusai shows that
hawaiians co-created the western modeled
land tenure system
along with advisors and that many
hawaiians learned the system
and had land staffer shows they lost
land mainly due to foreclosure
after 1874 due to the
non-judicial foreclosure law
which eliminated judicial oversight
preza shows that the mahele was a
necessary but not sufficient condition
for land
dispossession my own research
suggests that the land tender system
embedded
hawaiian rights and land rather than
alienating hawaiians from it
number 10 a great majority of hawaii
residents supported statehood
in 1959
in 1959 94 of hawaiians reaffirmed that
commitment to become americans by voting
to become a state
williams shows that while it may be true
that the vast majority of hawaii
residents who voted supported statehood
in 1959
only 132 000 people actually voted for
statehood
about one-fifth the population at the
time
[Music]
this is a far cry from 94 percent
dean serenellio also tracked
anti-statehood sentiment in his
dissertation
seeing conquest noting that kamakila
campbell had opposed statehood and in
fact became a kind of mouthpiece for
those who opposed it
but feared for the loss of their jobs or
other repercussions
campbell who was part of the kawananakoa
family became famous
for saying i am hawaii
opposed forfeiting the rights of natives
of these islands
for a mere thimble full of votes in
congress
mahalo for listening remember to
subscribe

aloha
[Music]
i'm noah takes hawaii you're a wahoo
specialist
and your crazy college kid student
political science major
anyway i'm noah takesway welcome back to
the chan
no if you haven't already subscribed why
don't you do that right now
um i'm trying to grow this thing i'm
trying to
grow it i'm trying to get it big so
let's do that
i'm going to be more regular with my
content i'm gonna get weekly videos
weekly videos and today
for our video i want to talk about
major misconceptions about living in
hawaii
because as i keep going back and forth
from the island
to back home i keep getting the same
things
people say to me and it kind of drives
me crazy but besides that i want to just
educate and
just maybe share some new facts that you
didn't even know
now of course i don't know everything
about hawaii i've not lived there as
my whole life i'm not from there but
i do enjoy it and i try to learn as much
as i can about it
when i'm there so here are my facts
thanks hawaii for letting me
do this like number one every island has
a volcano
yes every island had a volcano that's
how they were made
from volcanoes and there's different
hikes you can go where it's like a
remnant
a volcano it's like a crater or
something
but the big island is actually the only
place with an active volcano
so people always ask me oh you're fine
with the volcano and
the lava and like yeah i'm fine
because there's not an active volcano on
the island i wish there was
that would be so cool that'd be so cool
if it didn't like affect anything and
stuff
but yeah so not every island has an
active okay i'm actually only in hawaii
as
the big island which you can call hawaii
number two
it's sunny every day paradise and sun
it actually rains a lot it depends on
which part of the island you're on if
you're on the windward side
that's what gets the most rain
it actually rains frequently and more
than often
it's not sunny it might be sunny
and then it gets rainy so yeah it
definitely depends on where you live in
the island
but it's not necessarily sunny every day
and people always feel like well maybe
rains and it clears off and sunday again
yes and no there's days where it's just
always cloudy and rainy and
it's not fun so i would definitely say
it's not sunny every day number three
you can travel
easily between all the islands you can
take little boats and they're so close
and you can do all the time
that's not really true there are flights
you cannot boat
to the other islands because it damages
the coral reefs
you can fly and they are pretty short
trips
but they aren't like super cheap they
are pretty cheap if you can find a good
deal
for around 70 dollars round trip but
it's not like as easy as you would think
i've actually not been to another island
yet
that will change this semester it's
embarrassing but
it's not like island hopping super easy
fortunately another misconception is
that everything on your island is close
to you
it's an island it's a circle
everything's real close you just go
it's not true because roads do not go
through mountains
a lot of times the road just goes around
and you have to find a way to get in
and it's it's like it takes
me a good hour to get a walmart
good hour it takes me a good hour really
to get anywhere because i live up
in the windward coast where everything
is down to the south
so you have to go all the way down you
can go
to go all the way around so
it's kind of a headache not the most
fun now you have to always just go
around the coast to get anywhere
five number five you must never study
how do you have time to study you're too
busy
join hawaii honestly this isn't a
misconception
i study more than most people study in
their normal college
and that's just because of me that's so
this more personal thing but
just because it's why doesn't mean i
don't study and doesn't it doesn't also
just mean that i'm
not stuck there are some people that
don't say that much
that's like any college just because
it's why i don't think that makes it
much different
because no matter what school you go to
you'll find something to do
that will distract you from studying
number six
everything looks like a resort
no not everything actually looks like a
resort most time looks like quite
opposite because
since it's an island things are
expensive things are hard to get
so repairs on homes infrastructure
kind of takes a toll also the salty air
rust it's just a combination of
issues so things do look a little dated
and
out of place not like a beautiful resort
magazine
vibe there's a few places on the island
actually do that
it's not like a big deal it's not like a
thing that shouldn't matter
it's just people always have this we
have this idea you know
it's just gonna look like this
immaculate pristine place
but it's really hard to maintain homes
number seven here's one it's a little
dark a little depressing
a little intimate you must love living
there
i do love living there i do
but do i love all the time no it's not
perfect it has its flaws
you kind of feel isolated there's little
island
you know what's that called fever
island fear you get a little trapped
like i kind of want to go and
just drive and drive and drive and
it's it's a real thing so you can't
expect it's gonna be perfect and that's
actually kind of a reason
a lot of people do transfer out of boy
that are from like
the main land they're not used to island
living people from
other places in polynesia you know
they're they're used to it
but people who come from this area where
you can drive and
everything's so spread out and nothing's
compact
it's a little adjusty it's a little
adjustment
but it's if you find a way to get over
that
it's worth it number eight everyone
serves
i still haven't served yet maybe this is
more just an issue for me
i should be surfing but you know it's
not like everyone searched there i mean
there's a lot of people that surf but
there's like also people that don't
surf but this is not the best
misconception because i'm kind of
contradicting myself but it's not like
there's so many opportunities to serve
let's put it that way
we've gone to number nine it must cost
so much to go to college there
luckily byu
subsidizes a lot of the costs
if you wanted to know
so it's actually like not that expensive
considering it's in hawaii
however yes groceries are expensive milk
is
at least five dollars a gallon there's
other things that are kind of normal
but you should expect everything to be
at least
50 to a dollar 50 cents
a little let's say a dollar or more
yeah so that is as a little
low pricey but you have to expect that
because they ship all this food in
from boats and votes
are hard too man
okay guys i'm i made this list of all my
misconceptions in august 24 2019
i was still here it was been last summer
i must be depressed because i also said
my last misconception is i must be
living my best life
i think people just like you see
the instagram photos you think hawaii's
this way and it's perfect
but everyone has their own challenges
and their own issues
they would face regardless where they
were and specific challenges that
happened just because of where they're
living like there's issues of isolation
that i face on the island and
homesickness and relationships you know
like
friendships and stuff all of these
culminate into why
i don't like the phrase living my best
life you should always try to be living
your best life
your best life is gonna be hard there's
gonna be challenges
not gonna be the best but if you're
trying and aiming for the best
you are like essentially living your
best life so
you don't even need to be saying i'm
living my best life only when this is
happening
does this rant make sense let me know in
the comment section below
anyway that's all 10 misconceptions i
have
i probably left out a lot because i made
this list a year ago and i'm
but i finally did this video that i was
going to do up to his set for a year
anyway thanks for watching
hope you learned more and you want to
visit me in hawaii because
i'm so ready to go back
see you in the next one

so we've all been there looking at a
word or name and not knowing how to say
it
so let's go over 10 common hawaiian
words and places or names that are often
mispronounced by visitors
and even locals and by the end of this
video you'll be speaking like a local
well probably not but at least you won't
be embarrassed or second guess yourself
in hawaii and i'm not approaching this
as some authoritative source who has
either scolded you or put you to shame
in full transparency here are some
english words that i'm
still unsure how to pronounce that i
find quite embarrassing instead i'm
approaching this
as a work in progress because i also
mispronounce
some hawaiian words and not because i
don't know but because sometimes
i'm lazy and i let it slip hawaii
hawaii you'd be surprised this is a very
common mistake
and pretty much a dead giveaway that
you're not from hawaii
it should be hawaii with a little pause
and an e sound and this is very
understandable in a way since
people often will say hawaiian so
why makes sense the other day i was
watching something on tv and there was
this government representative
who kept saying hawaii in an interview
and that looks pretty bad if you're a
visitor i get it
totally understandable but come on you
live in hawaii
and bonus tip if you want to sound more
correct
or proper you can say hawaii with a v
sound like hawaii i don't think i've
ever said that in a conversation
but it might be something that you hear
oahu oahu
this is one i said for years as a kid
obviously i know how to spell the word
but growing up
i just said like there was an imaginary
w
in the word and i still don't know where
i got that from even on the mainland in
college i got away with it because no
one was there
to correct me so i would say yeah i'm
from oahu
it's in hawaii but now as an adult i
should probably say it properly
honolulu honolulu this is a common
mispronunciation that a lot of locals
get wrong
including me i get tripped up all the
time i've actually been called out on it
in some of my videos and in real life
and i know how to spell honolulu with
letter o
but when i speak fast honolulu just
comes out
this is something that i let slip for
years until about three or four years
ago i took this tour of washington place
which is the governor's mansion and the
woman who was our guide
was very knowledgeable and at the end of
the tour she concluded with a talk about
the importance of saying names correctly
and honolulu was the first word she
talked about and i felt really
self-conscious
but the fact that she brought it up
shows that it's a pretty common mistake
embarrassing yet common so if you hear
honolulu in my videos just know that i'm
working on it
aloha this one is super common among
locals especially public speakers
because we have this thing in hawaii
where people often will open up their
speeches with
a low ha and then the audience replies
i get it i know it's a local thing but
it's equivalent to saying
hello i mean come on
no one says that and this one is hard
because this is just a thing that we do
in hawaii
but i understand the sentiment behind it
mahelo
mahalo this is a common one since some
tourists try to use some basic hawaiian
words on their vacation which i think is
totally fine that they
try you know it shows that they're
trying to learn a little bit more about
the culture and
language is part of a culture and i
totally understand this mispronunciation
they see
hollow and they think it's like halo so
of course you're gonna pronounce it
my halo like like like this is the one
that locals all joke about for tourists
this is the highway that you'll take
on oahu to get from downtown honolulu to
the windward side and you see the word
like
and you just repeat it twice like like
so very common mistake
but it's like
this one i really don't expect tourists
to get because a lot of locals struggle
to pronounce this one correctly
kalanianaole is the highway that you'll
take from downtown honolulu to east oahu
to hanauma bay and it wraps around
through waimanalo it's a beautiful drive
if you get the chance
but kalani ano ole even one of the local
newscasters consistently
mispronounces this one kalaniolet either
that
or he says it's so fast that i can't
hear
the middle syllables this one is tricky
for visitors i mean you might see that w
and think ewa so completely understand
the basic rule for the w sound is if it
appears
after an i or e it's usually a v sound
if it's after a u or o it's usually a w
sound and if it starts a word or comes
after the letter a it's either
a v or a w sound i know it's a little
complicated
and once you make the ewa mistake don't
worry you'll get corrected
pretty fast but it
sounds like a little cute baby talk
kaneohe kaneohe
i have been guilty of this one a lot i
grew up in kaneohe on the island of oahu
and let me just say it was
hard to unlearn this one i don't know if
it's a kaneohe thing
or what my mispronunciation makes no
sense since
this is where i'm from i should know how
to say the name of the city where i'm
from
and clearly the letters don't match up
to what i'm saying but i must have
picked this up from somewhere
and i think it's a thing that other
people from kaneohe say
and if you're from that side of the
island let me know how you say it i'm
from kaneohe
yeah still working on it hilo hilo
of course the wonderful little town on
the big island
again understandable you see high h i
and you think it's high also looks like
the word
silo so makes sense but this is very
quick to correct nothing to be
embarrassed about
hilo is a great town you should check it
out cafe 100
can't wait to go back try some local
mojo
and bonus the state fish
and no one will expect you as a visitor
to say this most people
just say but there you go so let me
leave you with why this is so important
in hawaii
it's because language is important and
just like saying people's names
correctly saying the names of places
correctly
is important and in hawaii a lot of the
culture is about respect
and respect can start with the words i'm
not a linguist and my hawaiian word
pronunciation could use a lot of work
and with a platform like youtube i need
to make sure i'm communicating
the names of places and words properly
so that i'm sharing accurate information
because i think it does a real
disservice if i had a local i'm not
addressing places
and persons with a certain respect so
hope this was helpful
thanks for watching and
at this joke aloha

what's up guys it's your girl fire here
and in today's video I'm going to be
doing five stereotypes that are of
Hawaii or five stereotypes in Hawaii or
mainlanders try to assume on Hawaii I
lived a lot of these and they're pretty
big conversations okay so if you are
sensitive to a controversial content
then you are more than welcome to click
out of this video and go check out my
other videos I have DIYs you can watch I
have makeup videos I have recipe videos
um you can go and binge on that but if
you are here for this controversial
topic then let's get started with this
video first of all first of all hold on
hold on hold on get the elephant in the
room for the people that do not know
that are going to click on this video
that never seen before in their life and
not even subscribe to my channel
hi I am born and raised in Hawaii my
family is born and raised from Hawaii
okay
just that's why I can do a video like
this because I'm actually rooted in my
culture and I'm from there and I'm black
in Hawaiian so if you guys don't know
now you do so let's talk about the first
stereotype the first stereotype has to
do with race because I'm black because I
look black I am NOT Hawaiian I am not
from Hawaii prime example I did a video
on Hawaiian slang a lot of locals was
like oh who is this chick trying to
teach you know Hawaiian pidgin Hawaiian
local slang she don't even look Hawaiian
or she don't even talk monk she don't
even have long and who hair and I am NOT
kanaka maoli like I'm not Hawaiian I'm
not from there you're black no she's
black are you gonna tell me what I am
I'll wait how are you gonna tell me that
I'm not Hawaiian
when I just said what I am you don't
know me you don't know my family that is
so dumb
but the stereotype is that if you don't
look a certain way if you don't look
local then you're not local a lot of
people assume that you're not and then
it's not good to assume you make an ass
out of you and yourself um the second
stereotype is that Hawaiians are
light-skinned and they look more Asian
newsflash Hawaiians
are darker than me and if you think I'm
dark sister Mary I don't know if you
think
litleo Kalani is like midnight
pitch-black okay because then yo Kalani
is darker than me Duke Kahanamoku
darker than me King Kamehameha the first
darker than me King David Kalakaua
darker than me Native Hawaiians are of
deeper skin complexion okay a lot of
people of course and it has to do with
racism I like to believe commercial
Hawaiians to be you know long silky bone
straight hair and very fair skin
complexion Asian eyes and it's like no
Hawaiians don't look like that now if
you're mixed then you know you probably
do look like that but Native Hawaiians
I'm sorry honey but they are they're
very deep in complexion okay if you
really want to go there let's take it
back to the 17 1800 s the pictures don't
lie so you might want to get your eyes
tweaked a little bit and kind of you
know kind of get off of that horse okay
moving on next thing that is a very big
stereotype that it just blows my mind
Hawaii is paradise oh I love being in
Hawaii we're on the beach every day and
burrata is in the background playing all
the time and hula girls just doing a
hula all around you the sunset and
alcohol drinking on the beach and you're
just having a good old married time and
although that may be a reality for some
people but the honest reality is that a
lot of locals are struggling
don't mean to offend anybody but I'm
speaking from experience and from what I
know a lot of locals are struggling if
you are not in the military or if you
don't have a very and I mean a very good
job there is no possible way you could
make it in Hawaii if you were just to
move from the mainland to Hawaii there's
no just no possible way from experience
I've seen people do it and they got they
asked right back up and left back to the
mainland
a lot of people in Hawaii are on welfare
section eight government assistance
right the bus public transportation my
family was all four of that my mom
offered that me off for that you know
what I mean like you can't just based
off of what the tourists want you to see
there are poor people there are homeless
people in Hawaii and that's just what it
is
Oh Hawaii is paradise but to a certain
extent there's people just struggling
just like people in the States the
fourth one is Hawaii is not a part of
the US okay if Hawaii is not a part of
the US why can we vote why do we have
the American flag right next to the
Hawaiian flag why is the military here
why do we even speak English kanaka
maoli believe that Hawaii is not a part
of the US and what kanaka maoli is is
just a organization that have different
beliefs then you know what is taught in
school and that's fine but the sad
reality is that in 1898 Hawaii became a
u.s. territory and it became that way
illegally if you guys wanna look it up
you can google it Hawaii history or
Queen Liliuokalani and you guys can see
how that all went down and it wasn't
right and I don't agree with it in 1959
Hawaii had its statehood we were pretty
much American city
since etc etc I am a firm believer in my
culture I love Who I am I'm very proud
of you know being Hawaiian and all of
that stuff but at some point you gotta
come into realization and realize that
why is a state whether we like it or not
for the longest time but there has been
organizations and people that gather and
panels that gather and talk about this
and want to gain the aina back and the
game you know just that Hawaiian way of
living back and it's kind of hard for
something that happened 200 plus years
ago the Hawaii today is really really
not even close to being a mere scent of
what the original Hawaii was but I'm
here for my Hawaiian people okay and the
last big stereotype that I just I always
got when I left into the Navy and I was
around a lot of shipmates is what they
called it a lot of people will ask me oh
my god you're from Hawaii what's it like
is there really like grass skirts and
you know coconut bras is there really
hula girls that welcome you in at the
airport
no but TSA well oh my god you're from
Hawaii is do you guys like living grass
huts no but you can build one if you
want to oh my god in Hawaii do you guys
like have tsunamis all the time no but
if you don't know how to swim you can
drown oh my god are you know lilo and
stitch is Hawaii like that Hawaii is
exactly like everything in the u.s. is
very modern okay we live just like
everybody else in the u.s. we don't go
hunting for food on this you know you
live in the countryside and that's you
know your hobby that's something that
you want to do you can hunt for food
okay by all means but and
the modern-day Hawaii we do pretty much
everything everybody else does we have
mobile devices we have vehicles we have
IDs and social security cards yes are we
done here but that is it for this video
if I missed any other stereotypes then
let me know in the comments below
because a lot of you ain't afraid to
tell me what you think about everything
that I just said and I'm here for it I'm
gonna read each and every comment that I
get we're just gonna talk about it I'm
gonna have a discussion about it thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
guys enjoyed it I hope you guys had a
clear mind of these stereotypes you know
what I mean if you guys want more videos

about 10 million people visit Hawaii
each year that's more than seven times
Hawaii's entire residential population
this is not sustainable non-native
people need to stop coming to Hawaii Wow
Let's talk about it
[Music]
so I came across an opinion piece in the
daily princetonian entitled Hawaii is
not and will never be your vacation
paradise and as a local who was born and
raised here and is currently living here
in Hawaii I want to give my opinion
because a lot of the statements in this
piece we're pretty bold and they offer
one opinion but not the only opinion so
I want to go through the article and
provide another Local's perspective
about visiting Hawaii I also want to
note that I'm not native Hawaiian but I
consider myself a local I was born and
raised here graduated from high school
here I did spend some time on the
mainland in college and post-grad but
then I moved back here and I'm now
currently raising my family and I
mentioned this distinction because it's
important between native wine and local
and if you feel that being non-native
Hawaiian disqualifies me from this
conversation and by extension all
non-native Hawaiians are excluded from
this discussion well I guess you can
just skip the rest of the video but if
not and you just want to hear another
Local's perspective then let's get
started when people see the word
indigenous who do they think of for many
if not most non-indigenous people native
Hawaiians aren't the first to come to
mind as a native Hawaiian who is
repeatedly encountered the non-native
perspective or lack thereof about the
connection between Indian
indigenuity indigenous indigenous engine
indigeneity gosh you can't say that word
between indigeneity and native Hawaiian
sorry in public school I feel
comfortable making this inference
interactions with non-natives have
revealed to me that people rarely think
about how Hawaii was annexed or pushed
in the statehood or how this history
impacts native Hawaiian Life today in
fact many people believe their
relationship between Hawaii and America
is something we should be proud of okay
so first just a couple of comments on
here I think when people think of
indigenous people
and you take a sample worldwide or even
just within a nation domestically I
don't think native Hawaiian comes up
that often just speaking as someone who
was born and raised in Hawaii when I
hear the word indigenous I'm thinking of
people like people in South America or
Australia that's the term that I'm
associating with that word and maybe
that's based on just my Western
education but that's what I grew up with
here in Hawaii and this other statement
interactions with non-news have revealed
to me that people rarely think about how
Hawaii was annexed or pushed into
statehood so in my interactions with I
guess as the author would call them
non-natives basically like it's not
people who aren't from Hawaii or people
who are in Hawaii who aren't native
Hawaiian I'm not exactly sure the the
reference here but either way for my
interactions on the mainland people
really think about Hawaii and you don't
know that until you actually move away
and for anyone who's been away from
Hawaii for a significant amount of time
you know this when you're in Hawaii
everything is a big deal right the
newest place that opens up for boba tea
or that new store that just opened up or
the traffic or whatever concert's coming
into town those are really big deals
here and even State politics it's a big
deal here locally but the thing is when
you move outside of Hawaii you rarely
hear about Hawaii unless it's a volcano
or they happen to win some kind of like
college sports title you rarely hear
about Hawaiian I didn't realize that
until I went away to Colorado nobody
even cared about Hawaii it doesn't mean
that Hawaii wasn't important it's just
that nobody thought about Hawaii the way
that we think about Hawaii here and I
think it's important to remember that
that on the mainland Hawaii is just one
place it's one of 50 States and it's the
most isolated so people don't really
think about Hawaii at all the same way
that people in Hawaii don't think about
places like Delaware or or
Maine or Montana not saying that those
are bad places it's just we don't think
about those things because they're so
far away we're so concerned with what's
going on here locally that there's
really no interest in that so I don't
really blame I guess non-natives
for not thinking about Hawaii because
yeah they don't all right moving on this
mindset is tangible the romanticization
of Aloha or of a Tropical Paradise of
seeing Hawaii merely as the 50th state
of taking advantage of Hawaii's forced
Reliance on tourism and jumping at every
opportunity to visit the lack of regard
for native Hawaiians when it comes to
honoring our indigeneity and existence
Israel I could say at that time and its
effects are visible and it has been
impacting native Hawaiians and quality
of life in Hawaii for far too long okay
so a couple things just want to mention
here I don't know if it's unnecessarily
forced Reliance on tourism I feel like
Hawaii has put itself in that position
we had other economic Industries like
agriculture but Hawaii is limited our
resources here are limited and our
ability to produce anything I personally
think of of real material value we just
don't really have that in a large enough
scale where we can consider that a main
driver in terms of economic output and
so tourism obviously in makes sense we
have the natural resources for that our
state is sort of advantageous in those
geographical features we have beaches we
have nice Green Mountains we have nice
weather those types of things you don't
get every single place in the U.S and
even in the places that do have those
people want to get away from that and so
they come here and so I don't think that
Hawaii is forced into tourism that's
convenient because of the things that we
have here but I don't think we're ever
forced into tourism we could try other
things and I was hoping that the state
would open up to different Industries
and different Technologies perhaps just
different areas where we don't have to
rely so much on visitors coming here
spending some money and then leaving
possibly introducing industries that
could pay higher wages that really could
contribute other things to the world
besides just basically service and
entertainment frankly Hawaii didn't see
too many new Industries emerge in the
past few years when we actually had
hands it just didn't really happen we
were trying to just stay afloat and so
that's too bad that's on us that's on
the state to hopefully change that and
to diversify and really think about what
can we do here besides just luau's and
helicopter rides about 10 million people
visit Hawaii each year that's more than
seven times Hawaii's entire residential
population this is not sustainable
non-native people need to stop coming to
Hawaii on record we got over 10 million
people that came in 2019 then we saw the
huge dip in 2020 and it's slowly
recovered and frankly we're on track to
even break that record I'd say next year
especially once the Japanese market
returns I mean domestically we've gotten
huge amounts of tourists coming from
East Coast and West Coast primarily and
that's been able to carry us
economically here in Hawaii but we
haven't seen too many Japanese visitors
when I came back from Japan late last
year our plane was really empty it was
convenient because we had two kids but
it was pretty empty and you don't see as
many Japanese tourists but you're
starting to see more and more them and
once they return in full force which
could be I think they projected by
possibly the end of 2023 I forgot what
HCA had mentioned but I think their
projection is for late 2023
unfortunately
they were projecting it a lot sooner but
if that ends up happening that sets up
2024 to be the year that we top 10 and a
half million possibly 11 million we'll
see I don't know if this can keep going
up to paint on the overall U.S and World
economy but assuming we watch this trend
we could see a record-breaking year in
2024 and it wouldn't surprise me if we
reached close to 10 million in 2023. I
do agree that this is not sustainable
and they've talked about ways to make it
more sustainable right sustainable
tourism I'm not sure what that means
it's a pretty nice buzzword
but they've talked about that but in
terms of non-native people needing to
stop coming to Hawaii that's a sentiment
that I don't agree with I'll address
that more later in this article but I
just want people to know up front if
they don't make it to the end or towards
that part of the video that not everyone
thinks that way I know there are some
locals who are very expressive of that
opinion and they want to persuade people
to not come to Hawaii completely
understand that's their right to say
that and that's their opinion likewise I
feel like I want to share my opinion and
explain why I don't necessarily agree
with that opinion but anyway moving on
besides the fact that over tourism has
created excessive congestion on the
islands and has thrown the distribution
of resources into an imbalance for
residents native Hawaiian culture also
continues to be overly commodified
misconstrued misconstrued and exoticized
these mental and physical tolls caused
by tourism are often most severe for
native Hawaiians who continually bear
the trauma of centuries-long
colonization on top of being a
significant portion of the homeless
population and being constantly priced
out of our homeland by the Myriad of
non-natives who insist on moving to
Hawaii
native Hawaiians are having a grapple
with the psychological and spiritual
effects of witnessing the complete
disrespect for and misrepresentation of
native Hawaiian culture and our aino in
terms of native Hawaiian culture being
overly commodified misconstrued or
exoticized I think about places like
Polynesian Cultural Center or Bishop
Museum
is that overly commodified or is that
simplified I don't think so that's I
think a pretty good explanation of not
just native Hawaiian culture but also
different cultures of the Pacific Ocean
and Pacific Islander cultures so I don't
know if that's necessarily overly
commodified I mean there's definitely
some images I'm sure people can think of
where it's got like the hula and you got
like the luau and all these different
things and yeah it's not really a real
Luol but that's a commercialized version
of it that's what the tourists come here
to enjoy and that's what the hotels and
these
tourism industry people that's what they
provide and on top of being a
significant portion of the homeless
population and being constantly priced
out of our homeland by a myriad of
non-nativists who insist on moving to
Hawaii so I do agree that native
Hawaiians do tend to make up a large
proportion of the homeless population
which is quite sad and I don't really
understand why that is but that usually
seems to be in the numbers every time
they do a point in time account of the
wholeness in Hawaii I think we tend to
think that oh it's all these people from
the mainland being shipped here and
that's why our homeless population is so
bad and there definitely are some people
who aren't from Hawaii who are homeless
here but just based on the numbers if
native Hawaiians make up the largest
portion our largest percentage of the
homeless population in Hawaii
whatever you're going to do about that
why is it like that and we have agencies
to hopefully address that we have the
office of Hawaiian Affairs and
Department of Hawaiian homelands those
are two state agencies that could offer
assistance so I don't understand how
come that continues to be the trend here
but it definitely is the trend I've come
face to face with the effects of Tourism
and absolute disregard for Native
existence throughout my entire life
ignorant of Hawaiian history culture and
basic respect non-native visitors come
to our islands and trespass on lands
that are often culturally significant
and sacred similarly tourists visit
places that physically cannot
accommodate everyone because they are so
overpopulated despite the countless
broadcast about issues caused by over by
such overcrowding ignorant of Hawaiian
history culture and basic respect
non-native visitors come to our islands
and trespass on lands Etc I just want to
make sure that this is not a statement
that's blanketed towards all visitors
because not everyone acts that way
maybe some do but not all visitors act
that way and I think it's important to
recognize that and it's too bad that we
do see incidences of people
disrespecting you know
natural resources here animals and it's
definitely something that is looked down
upon and shamed online which I don't
know if that necessarily changes
anything but I don't think a statement
like that applies to everyone and to all
visitors non-native visitors I don't
think it applies to everyone
and in terms of being ignorant of
Hawaiian history culture and basic
respect obviously they're not going to
get hawaiiana
wherever they're from they're not going
to know about Hawaiian history that's
part of the reason why they want to
maybe come here to learn about those
things so I don't think that that can be
held against them likewise if you
probably ask a lot of local people who
grew up here who maybe aren't native
Hawaiian maybe some who are native
Hawaiian but people who aren't native
Hawaiian who are local here in Hawaii I
think you probably be shocked by how
many people don't know Hawaiian history
to be perfectly transparent I don't
remember much from high school and it
wasn't until I read that little Kalani
Memoir that it really refreshed my
appreciation and just awareness of what
happened in Hawaii and how life used to
be because it's something that we just
kind of forget over time and basic
respect well can't always control that
but I do believe that a lot of tourists
are pretty respectful there are some
tourists who aren't very respectful just
like there are some locals who aren't
very respectful but I like to think that
the majority of them are respectful and
I think if you have that kind of Outlook
then it's not as bad at least that's the
way I choose to live my life where I try
to believe in the best of others all
right next part as someone who lives
next to major tourist hot spots in the
countryside the nearest grocery and drug
stores are often inaccessible to my
family and I due to the sheer number of
people that drive down every day for
these destinations this makes us have to
take longer drives out of town just to
get basic necessities I know family and
friends who must plan out their entire
schedules around traffic
or tourist traffic because if they do
not they risk getting stuck in
bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours on
end sometimes these family and friends
have no choice but to sit in traffic
because roads are often still congested
by the time they're on their way home
from work this is our everyday reality
the North Shore infrastructure is just
not built it wasn't planned for having
tourists to come up there it's one lane
both ways there's also a lack of parking
I mean I remember when we were trying to
find parking up there you kind of just
park wherever and you're Crush there's
just not a lot going on up there which
in part is to keep the country country
right but at the same time it's just not
a place that can handle that many
tourists and they've tried to look for
Alternatives whether it's
like one of those bridges that you can
walk over or a better parking lot or
just reroute the road but until they
actually move on that unfortunately that
part of the island is going to be
just stuck with a lot of traffic but
there are also a lot of other places
that have traffic too and it shouldn't
be ignored this isn't just a North Shore
problem it's
a problem in a lot of other places on
Oahu where once the tourists are in yeah
it gets pretty bad so definitely one
thing that I feel bad for the people up
in North Shore and I'm not quite North
Shore where I grew up but I'm on that
side windward side
but I do feel for that I know it's a
hard thing so I definitely understand
trying to build your life around traffic
and making sure that you don't get stuck
in traffic but at the same time I think
that's more about the infrastructure and
just the road conditions I'm gonna skip
a couple things about the Red Hill thing
but they're in the article if you want
to read that you'd like to think that
such a life-threatening situation would
warrant a halt or at the very least that
the client of tourist arrival in to
Hawaii so that residents and tourists
wouldn't have to compete for clean water
a basic necessity yeah nothing was done
to mitigate this issue completely
unaware of what residents and eight
people were facing tourists continue to
arrive in droves and people suffered
because of it so I understand what
happened with the water I was here when
it happened and they're still trying to
figure out what they're going to do with
that hole
that whole situation but in terms of
tourists continuing to come to Hawaii
I don't think that was ever the message
during that time or even now I don't
think the message has been don't come
because we're going through this water
situation here and it just impacts a
portion of this Ally it doesn't impact
the entire Island and
I can just say that for people who live
not in that area that halawa I think
Watershed aquifer area it hasn't
impacted other parts of the island as
much now it doesn't mean that what those
people are going through is not
important I'm just saying that it
doesn't impact the entire Island
particularly in the Waikiki area and so
I don't think tourists even if they knew
about it it would have that much of an
impact and people suffered because of it
I'm curious how people suffered from
that particularly what because of the
result of tourists coming that they had
a negative impact I just don't see the
connection between tourists coming
during that time or during this time and
people suffering in terms of the
relation to the water situation maybe
the connection is just lost on me but I
don't really see that getting on the
home stretch here so when I see
countless Princeton students flying to
Hawaii for a vacation to see the same
overcrowded and often desecrated
attractions I'm reminded of what kanaka
go through day in and day out unless
something changes kanaka have no choice
but to continue to endure these living
conditions it is us who must face these
problems and find resolutions for them
non-native visitors have a home another
place they can go back to we don't a
couple of points here I do want to agree
with I do agree that a lot of people
come to see the same overcrowded I
wouldn't say desecrated attractions but
they like to see the same and
overcrowded stuff and it's always
surprised me why people tend to always
gravitate towards
certain things and I guess they just
want to experience it and share it now
on social media say that they did it but
frankly I think it's just kind of boring
when you go and do the same thing that
everyone else does you know I mean
aren't there enough pictures of Diamond
Head or of the ocean or of makapu
Lighthouse and that's not to say that
people can't take new pictures it might
be beautiful and amazing but pretty much
have seen it all in fact I kind of want
to make a video where I vacation Hawaii
by not actually vacationing and doing
anything but just green screening myself
in front of where everyone else goes
because I feel like when you look online
it's the same types of shots because
people just look and they're like oh
that looks like a good shot and they
just end up copying so I do agree that
people tend to do the same things and if
people were to ask oh well what should I
do then what types of things should I do
if I don't want to copy and just keep
doing what everyone else does try to
explore some areas outside of the
tourist attractions and
you might enjoy Parks or you might enjoy
hikes that aren't your stereotypical
hikes maybe shopping in places that
aren't all Moana or Waikiki and eating
at some places that aren't always on the
top 10 places to eat in Hawaii lists on
Yelp Just places that local people eat
I've recommended some of them on this
channel and they provide foods that real
local people actually buy orosi's
restaurants wouldn't exist because
tourists don't go there and that last
sentence non-native visitors have a home
another place they can go back to we
don't this is definitely a sentiment
that I agree with when it comes to when
people move here you know when people
from the mainland move to Hawaii and
let's say they decide they're bored or
they don't want to live here anymore
they can always go back to where they're
where they're from and that's okay but
when you grow up here in Hawaii and you
get kind of priced out
you don't have anywhere else to go
because you have to go to a new place
because you're from Hawaii and so that
is a little discouraging and I think
that's one of the things that a lot of
local people face which I think is why a
lot of people end up gravitating towards
places where there are a lot of other
local people like Las Vegas there are
always several counter arguments against
the point that people shouldn't visit
Hawaii many people feel entitled to
visit Hawaii because Hawaii's economy
relies on tourism and they're simply
contributing to the tourism Revenue but
the truth is a lot of the time people
don't really care about the state of our
economy they just want to fight a Hawaii
guilt-free and it shouldn't be a
surprise that most of the tourism
Revenue doesn't even benefit native
Hawaiians whom the tourism industry
exploits the most a lot of people don't
really care about the state of our
economy and not to sound so cynical but
why should they
they're a visitor they're just coming
here to have a good time and that
doesn't mean that they can act however
they want like like they'll act like
that but
they're not gonna look at our economy
and try and figure out what's going on
and try to put money where it needs to
be and there are some local people who
don't even understand our economy or
what's going on in current events here
and so you can't really expect tourists
to understand the state of our economy
they know Hawaii relies on tourism so to
me the best way to support that if I'm a
tourist who's not very familiar with
Hawaii
is to
participate in that tourism
economy to be a good tourist to spend
money to stay at places to go eat at
places to go shopping that's what they
do that's how you support a
tourism-based economy and if you want to
change that then we have to change our
economic system here but we're not so
how else
would they contribute to us I don't
quite understand that they just want to
fly to Hawaii guilt-free I can say as a
visitor as someone who's visited other
places I'm not going to another place to
feel guilty I'm going there because I
want to experience a new culture I want
to have a good time I want to relax
that's what a vacation is and you can do
those things by being respectful
but I don't think people want to come
here and feel that guilt nor do I feel
like they should come to Hawaii and feel
guilty because I'm just thinking why
would I pay all this money to fly all
the way over here
to feel guilty
that doesn't make too much sense I mean
I could spend my money in so many other
ways guilt-free and to come here and
to expect people to feel guilt for
something that they don't even
understand
I don't think that's
right to place that on them as a visitor
and in terms of the tourism industry
exploiting people when you look at the
tourism industry and the wages that are
paid
and the people who work in the tourism
industry primarily
honestly I see a lot of Filipinos
who are working
and not saying that it's exploiting them
but I'm just pointing out that when you
look at a lot of the service industry
workers directly connected to tourism
that's who I'm seeing those are the
people that are having to bus in or
drive in from wherever maybe they live
close but typically I just anecdotally
hear people just you know they gotta
catch a blast to go Waikiki right
maybe they're working two three jobs and
if we want to talk about certain ethnic
groups
I think just go Waikiki and look at
who's making the beds who's checking in
people who's cleaning up stuff down
there and you might have a different
answer I don't know if it's necessarily
just native Hawaiians
are impacted by tourism I think it's
everybody here and now the last
paragraph
and it ends it ends with a home run in
honor of this year's indigenous people's
day I want to emphasize this the writers
not not me okay
I'm not saying this you cannot claim to
respect advocate for or try to empower
indigenous people while also traveling
to Hawaii
thinking otherwise just means you don't
see Hawaii for what it is a native
Hawaiians or who we are a nation that is
fighting for our autonomy and deserved
place in our own land so I just want to
repeat that one more time because that's
that's pretty strong you cannot claim to
respect advocate for or try to empower
indigenous people while also traveling
to Hawaii
thank you
I don't agree with that I think that you
can
I think that you can respect the local
culture native Hawaiian culture local
people native Hawaiians
and still visit Hawaii I don't know
the history behind a statement like this
but again not everyone thinks this way
and I think it's important that people
remember that I don't think you can make
that assumption about others if they
just come here that they don't respect
native Hawaiian culture
I think if
you step back and you think about it
that tends to make a lot of sense but
when I read this statement especially
because it was the end of this article
I think that was the one that kind of
like that was the Catalyst for me to
make this video because I really don't
want people to believe that everyone
thinks that way in fact I don't think
most people would think that way and if
you pull that statement out
and if that is the emphasis of this
article I want to emphasize this then I
think you could see that
that statement may not necessarily be
true so I just want to point that out I
do want to acknowledge that there is
structure between locals and tourists so
it shouldn't be ignored that some local
people don't like tourists and some
tourists are also snobby and rude and
disrespectful you can't get around that
that just seems to be like The Human
Condition of how people are if you just
took a random sample from anywhere in
the world you're just going to get
people who act like that I like to think
that most people are good most visitors
are respectful and good they want to be
here and they want to have a good time
and yeah they're sensitive to what's
going on here culturally I mean sure
Shooters can be maybe irritating
sometimes I I use that term very Loosely
but sure they can be irritating at times
if they get lost or they go the wrong
way or they say something like
with poor pronunciation but again you
can't blame them for it I generally find
tourists to be pretty respectful and
nice they're just here to have a nice
time to enjoy all of this because
wherever they came from is not here and
they work hard to come here and the
thing is as locals we'd probably act the
same way somewhere else and hint we do
sometimes act that way somewhere else
but just like how all tourists don't act
that way that rude snobby very just
self-centered tourists not all locals
have this anti-tourism sentiment tourism
is definitely something that is
important and a big issue that we should
talk about here in Hawaii as a local you
just learn to grow up with tourists like
oh look there's a huge Bus full of
tourists or there's three trolleys going
together and they're just taking all
these tourists taking pictures and
they're having a good time or oh they're
lying kind of long here because get
plenty of tourists it's like yeah you
just grow up with that being in a
tourist destination that's just part of
growing up here in Hawaii and of course
I like our local economy to expand to
exciting things like technology or maybe
agriculture where it could be very
sustainable I'd love to see our state do
that but we're just not making those
steps yet and one last thing I want to
mention about these types of Articles or
social media posts where it's basically
don't come to Hawaii type of sentiment
I think they actually hurt
the tourism industry and the experience
that locals have with visitors because
they dissuade people
who would actually be good tourists they
might make them go on the fence and be
like ah we shouldn't go and it's because
they're good people that they consider
that and they see that or hear it or
read it and they decide okay that's just
not worth coming and that's too bad
because those are the visitors that we
want the respectful ones the kind ones
the ones who actually will read the sign
and listen and you know follow
directions and not go where they're not
supposed to go like those are the
visitors that we want
but by posting stuff like this and
making it sort of the main opinion it
almost seems like online for how locals
view people from the outside it really
is hurting
those people that group of people from
coming here and experiencing Hawaii and
so what's left is the people who aren't
even going to pay attention to that kind
of stuff anyway and they're going to go
do those disrespectful things and just
act however they want to act they're
just going to come here because they're
going to ignore all these posts anyway
and so it
it doesn't really do much I feel like in
that narrative in that discussion
because those bad tourists are going to
come here no matter what you say and it
just ends up persuading the tourists who
are good who are thinking about it to
choose somewhere else and so in the end
I hope that people really hear that not
all locals think that way I know it's
the main voice sometimes on social media
and maybe that's just part of what I can
do to contribute to this discussion to
just share that not everyone thinks that
way not everyone is to that extreme and
I'm not sure what caused that extreme
opinion to be
a narrative coming out of Hawaii or
about Hawaii
but I hope that people understand that
that's not the only one that it's one
perspective I respect that but there are
many perspectives on this spectrum and
you just don't hear about it because
most people don't feel the need to have
to talk about it because it seems I
think pretty obvious like yeah just come
be kind respectful have Aloha it's
pretty simple right it's pretty simple
yet
the people who would exercise those
things and behave that way they may not
want to come because of what they see or
what they think
local people think about them but to
close on this what would Hawaii look
like without tourists let's say the
author had their wish and non-native
people stop coming to Hawaii
well what happened well we got to
experience that in 2020 and most of 2021
where Hawaii
lock the door and not that many people
were able to come and as someone who was
living here I can say that it was an
interesting experience it was actually
quite enjoyable minus the whole you know
World catastrophe pandemic thing going
on but locally it was actually quite
nice there was no traffic
a lot of places weren't open
but we seem to get along okay and we
could enjoy a lot of the natural
resources here like the beach when we
could come or even some just outdoor
places it was never really that crowded
never had to worry about parking or
anything the quality of life was just
nice but it came out of sacrifice
you look at some of the businesses that
weren't able to make it and a lot of
businesses who still
won't be able to make it in the coming
future and the only reason why Hawaii
was able to make it was because we had
Federal money
to save us
but
if visitors were to leave now
there's no federal money coming
more businesses were shut down people
would go on unemployment
would be pretty hard life in Hawaii
would be even harder and it's hard to
imagine
but life would be even harder so until
we have some kind of
other industry that can take over or at
least supplement tourism to eventually
grow maybe to something more
we're kind of left with tourism only but
I don't want to see Hawaii without
tourism I know maybe that's a bold
statement but
it just seems like it's part of our
culture it's part of growing up here now
PC tourists and hey there's a tourist
right
but
until there's something else I don't
think
that will solve our problems in fact I
think it'll make it a lot worse and
harder in Hawaii love to hear what your
thoughts are in this article thanks for

The following is a beat sheet comprised of a generalized set of story beats for a Monster in the House story-type within the Save the Cat! methodology and a list of micro-beats associated with each respective section organized in a way that is most useful to me.

I want you to find any/all film cliches associated with each of these beats in mainstream films. Be thorough, detailed, granular, exhaustive, and comprehensive:

1. SET-UP  
  Description: Introduces the world, characters, setting, tone, internal logic, and moral framework. Establishes the sin, implied rules, and sets the tone of normalcy soon to be broken.  
  1.1 OPENING IMAGE  
    Description: A snapshot of life before the intrusion of horror. Often symbolic or ironic, reflecting what the protagonist believes the world is.  
    1.1.1 A familiar, safe environment is visually presented, but something is off—a small detail suggests the ordinary world is unknowingly under threat.  
  1.2 THEME STATED  
    Description: Someone voices the moral lesson or thematic question of the film, though it is not recognized as important at the time.  
    1.2.1 A line, action, or warning introduces the theme indirectly (“You break the rules, you pay the price”)—the premise is hinted at without clarity.  
  1.3 Characters are introduced with contrasting beliefs, values, and attitudes toward danger or boundaries.  
  1.4 The monster’s domain is introduced—rules, physical space, and power dynamics are hinted at but not yet tested.  
  1.5 The sin (greed, arrogance, betrayal) is demonstrated casually through the behavior of one or more characters.  
  1.6 Locals or outsiders disagree over what’s real, what’s serious, or what’s superstition.  
  1.7 A symbol, image, or object offers a warning—its importance is overlooked.  
  1.8 A past incident or rule is mentioned as irrelevant, dismissed as folklore.  
  1.9 A minor rule is broken without consequences—tension builds unnoticed.  
  1.10 A supporting character expresses concern or discomfort—others brush it off.  
  1.11 The environment reacts in a subtle, eerie way—animals behave strangely, something disappears.  
  1.12 CATALYST  
    Description: The story's inciting incident. The balance is broken. An irreversible disruption or offense that sets the monster in motion.  
    1.12.1 A major boundary is crossed or a taboo act committed—a shift in tone follows.  
    1.12.2 Something breaks, fails, or goes missing—a protective layer has been removed, though not everyone realizes it.  

2. DEBATE  
  Description: The characters question what happened. Suspicion, logic, and denial delay action. Conflicting interpretations arise.  
  2.1 Characters make excuses or rationalize the weird event with humor or logic.  
  2.2 Tension rises as characters argue over whether to act or dismiss what’s happening.  
  2.3 Someone vocalizes disbelief, pushing against growing signs of danger.  
  2.4 A character tries to leave or withdraw but is stopped by logistics, social pressure, or chance.  
  2.5 The group begins to fracture along emotional or ideological lines.  
  2.6 A new scare turns doubt into anxiety—uncertainty escalates.  
  2.7 Most decide to stay—perhaps for ego, money, or survival—despite warning signs.  
  2.8 Someone insists things are fine, calming the others just long enough to delay meaningful action.  
  2.9 BREAK INTO TWO  
    Description: The point of no return. The monster strikes or is definitively revealed. The group is now trapped in a world where horror is real.  
    2.9.1 The monster acts directly—someone is attacked or killed, confirming the threat and ending any doubt.  

3. FUN AND GAMES  
  Description: The “set-piece” section. Characters experiment with survival, test theories, and confront the monster in escalating scenarios. Tension, loss, and strategy unfold.  
  3.1 B STORY  
    Description: The emotional arc becomes more present. A secondary character or relationship reinforces the story’s moral question.  
    3.1.1 A relationship subplot deepens—an emotional or moral thread reflects the theme and helps anchor the hero.  
  3.2–3.29  
    Description:  
    - Characters try different survival methods (escape attempts, traps, hiding, calling for help).  
    - Monster displays intelligence or unpredictability.  
    - Environmental changes (flickering power, broken exits, blocked roads).  
    - Misunderstandings and blame within the group lead to tension.  
    - Rules are guessed and tested (e.g., “Don’t go into the woods at night”).  
    - Red herrings, false victories, minor reveals, and temporary safe zones.  
    - Increasingly creative or claustrophobic kill/set-piece scenes.  
    - Group members die one-by-one, often due to breaking the “unspoken rules.”  
    - The protagonist begins to form a hypothesis or emotional resolve.  
  3.30 MIDPOINT  
    Description: Either a false victory or devastating loss. A major kill, revelation, or plot twist forces reassessment of what’s at stake.  
    3.30.1 A character dies, or the group suffers a major loss—everything changes, and the monster’s power is now undeniable.  

4. BAD GUYS CLOSE IN  
  Description: The horror closes in physically and emotionally. The monster adapts, trust erodes, and resources dwindle. The house becomes a trap.  
  4.1–4.25  
    Description:  
    - Characters are hunted or picked off in confined, high-stakes settings.  
    - Group descends into paranoia, desperation, or conflict.  
    - Secrets are revealed (someone may have known more, betrayed the group, or invited the threat).  
    - The monster is increasingly understood but harder to defeat.  
    - Escape routes fail. Phone lines die. Help won’t come.  
    - Characters are pushed to their psychological breaking points.  
    - Emotional arcs from the B Story come into play—love, guilt, rivalry, sacrifice.  
    - Monster evolves or learns, subverting previous assumptions.  
    - Symbolic objects (photograph, weapon, family heirloom) take on new emotional weight.  
  4.26 ALL IS LOST  
    Description: A major death, plan failure, or irreversible loss. This moment breaks the group and often leaves the protagonist completely alone.  
    4.26.1 A key survivor is killed or the monster gains the upper hand—things can’t get worse.  

5. DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL  
  Description: The protagonist contemplates giving up but has a moment of clarity. This is the emotional and thematic reckoning.  
  5.1 The protagonist is alone—no help, no plan, no backup.  
  5.2 A piece of the past resurfaces—something from earlier now makes sense.  
  5.3 The theme becomes clear through memory, grief, or vision.  
  5.4 A choice is made to act regardless of survival odds.  
  5.5 The protagonist redefines what it means to win.  
  5.6 BREAK INTO THREE  
    Description: A new plan is forged—one rooted in emotional truth or thematic clarity. The hero accepts the cost and commits.  
    5.6.1 The new plan is based on the theme—not just survival, but justice, forgiveness, or self-respect.  

6. FINALE  
  Description: The protagonist executes the plan. The final confrontation with the monster tests what they’ve learned and who they’ve become.  
  6.1–6.19  
    Description:  
    - The protagonist reenters the monster’s space—no longer running, but hunting.  
    - Environmental obstacles test determination (fire, water, darkness, injury).  
    - The plan unfolds but requires improvisation.  
    - Other survivors may assist, sacrifice, or die in service of the theme.  
    - A reversal: what once seemed a weakness (e.g., empathy, memory) becomes a strength.  
    - The protagonist defeats the monster by obeying the corrected rule or breaking a false belief.  
    - Catharsis is delivered—visually, emotionally, narratively.  
    - The environment reflects the transformation (quiet returns, dawn breaks, rain ends).  
    - Final kills are purposeful—not random, but symbolic.  
  6.20 FINAL IMAGE  
    Description: A mirror or inversion of the Opening Image. Symbolizes internal and external change, earned through horror and sacrifice.  
    6.20.1 A visual callback to the Opening Image shows how the world—and the protagonist—have changed.

ChatGPT:


To fully align the cliches with each Monster in the House beat, could you clarify a couple things for me first:

Are you looking for strictly horror movie cliches (e.g. slasher, creature features), or would you also like examples pulled from horror-adjacent genres (e.g. thriller, sci-fi horror, survival horror)?

Would you like the cliches presented as direct parallels to the beat micro-beats (e.g., "1.2.1 - THEME STATED: 'You break the rules, you pay the price' – a cliche example is..."), or grouped by sections only?

Should the cliches include specific movie examples, or stay general in phrasing (e.g. "The creepy doll that no one takes seriously")?

Let me know how you’d like me to approach this and I’ll build the most useful and thorough reference possible for you.
--------------------------------------
User:


1. Pull from horror-adjacent films as well;
2. Grouping by section is fine;
3. Stay general please.

The cliches don't need to be exclusively from horror films, any genre will do -- but my interest, along with Monster in the House story-types, also aligns with Rites of Passage, Dude With a Problem, Buddy Love, and Whydunit stories as well. Sort them by their affect on plausibility: my biggest concern is that the story I want to tell will strain credulity further than an audience will accept, but all cliches are welcome.  
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Great! I’ll compile a comprehensive and plausibility-ranked list of cliches across all major genres—especially those aligned with the Monster in the House story-type (and its close cousins like Rites of Passage, Buddy Love, Whydunit, and Dude With a Problem). I’ll organize them by Save the Cat! beat section and flag the ones most likely to strain audience credibility.

I’ll get to work and let you know when it’s ready for you to review.

Monster in the House Beat Sheet Cliches (Plausibility Ranked)
Opening Image / Prologue

Cold-open victim: A minor character is introduced only to be killed in a prelude scare, establishing the monster’s threat early (Low Plausibility Risk – audiences expect an opening jolt).

Eerie establishing shot: A long ominous pan of the “house” (cabin, town, spaceship, etc.) accompanied by creepy music or thunder, immediately signaling dread (Low Plausibility Risk).

Ignorant introduction: The protagonist or group is shown in normalcy (e.g. cheerfully driving to a remote location at night) blissfully unaware of danger, sometimes even picking up a mysterious hitchhiker despite the spooky circumstances (Medium Plausibility Risk – characters seem oblivious, but it sets the stage).

Foreshadowing lore: An opening voiceover, text, or local legend hints at the dark history of the place or monster (“No one who enters these woods returns…”), laying out the curse or creature backstory (Low Plausibility Risk – a conventional horror setup device).

“It was just a dream” tease: The film opens with a terrifying scene that turns out to be a protagonist’s nightmare or imagination, before they wake up in bed (Medium Plausibility Risk – can feel like a cheap trick if overused, but it does convey the looming danger).

Set-Up (Act I Introduction)

“New home, new start” scenario: Characters arrive at or move into an obviously creepy or history-laden house (or town) but completely ignore/red-flag its ominous vibe or reputation (Low Plausibility Risk – horror protagonists often need a reason to be in the haunted locale).

Ominous local warning: A quirky local, neighbor, or old caretaker delivers a vague warning or says something like “You folks be careful out there” about the place/monster, which the protagonists politely dismiss as superstition (Medium Plausibility Risk – plausible they’d shrug it off, though the foreshadowing is obvious).

Personal demon foreshadowed: The hero’s personal weakness or trauma is introduced (e.g. fear of responsibility, a tragic loss, or a past “sin” like a mistake that will tie into the monster’s origin). This Save-the-Cat moment hints at the inner journey to come (Low Plausibility Risk – a standard narrative setup device, not usually viewed as a realism issue).

Group dynamics clichés: The characters fall into familiar roles during introductions – e.g. the nerd, the jock, the comic relief, the shy “final” girl – often with lighthearted banter before things go bad (Low Plausibility Risk, as audiences accept archetypes, though it’s tropey).

Ignored creepy clues: Early minor signs of danger are shrugged off – the dog barking at nothing, strange house noises (blamed on “old pipes or the wind”), or a creepy doll left behind that no one throws out (Medium Plausibility Risk – people might investigate such signs more in reality, but horror characters often rationalize them).

Urban legend exposition: A character shares a local myth or gruesome story about the setting (“They say this place was built on a graveyard…”) which everyone laughs off or downplays (Low Plausibility Risk – delivering backstory through campfire tale is common and accepted).

Save the Cat moment: The protagonist performs a small act of kindness or likeability (befriending a child, rescuing a cat, etc.) to gain audience sympathy in the calm before the storm (Low Plausibility Risk – purely a storytelling device, it doesn’t strain credibility).

Catalyst

Unwittingly unleashing evil: The group inadvertently provokes the monster or curse – for example, reading the forbidden incantation, playing with a Ouija board, or disturbing a sealed door “just for fun” (Medium Plausibility Risk – it requires characters to do the one thing they shouldn’t, but curiosity or skepticism can make it semi-believable).

The first victim disappears/dies: A side character goes missing or is found dead under mysterious circumstances, marking the monster’s first strike (Low Plausibility Risk – a logical inciting incident to kick off the horror, typically accepted by audiences).

Sin trigger: A character commits a “sin” that metaphorically invites the monster – e.g. ignoring a safety rule, pursuing greedy or lustful behavior, or breaking a cultural taboo tied to the location. This act sets the supernatural vengeance in motion (Low Plausibility Risk – fits the moral framework of Monster in the House stories).

Haunting call or sign: The catalyst can be a creepy message or sign from the antagonist – a bloody symbol on the wall, a distorted phone call from a dead relative, or an object moving on its own – clearly signaling that an otherworldly threat has arrived (Medium Plausibility Risk, since characters might doubt their senses at first, but it’s a staple to escalate the plot).

“The monster is real” moment: The protagonists catch their first fleeting glimpse of the monster or threat (a shadow lunging, eyes in the darkness, etc.), giving them a jolt. They may question what they saw, but the audience knows the hunt is on (Low Plausibility Risk).

Debate

Denial and rationalization: In the aftermath of the catalyst, characters debate what happened – Was it a prank? An animal? – clinging to normal explanations. The skeptic of the group insists “There’s no such thing as monsters” despite mounting odd evidence (Low Plausibility Risk – people often deny frightening realities initially).

“We should leave!” vs. “We can’t!”: A split opinion forms: one character urges everyone to flee immediately or call police, while another gives reasons to stay put – “It’s probably nothing,” or “We can’t just abandon the project/friends”. Often practical constraints like a storm or lost car keys conveniently force them to hunker down anyway (Medium Plausibility Risk – characters debating logical escape is natural, but circumstances always prevent the easy way out).

Convenient isolation (no help coming): Attempts to get outside help fail: the phone has no signal or a dead battery exactly when needed
learnenglish.britishcouncil.org
, and the car won’t start or the only bridge out has collapsed. This strands the characters with the threat (Medium Plausibility Risk – mechanical failures at perfect timing require some disbelief, but audiences tolerate them to get the plot truly confined).

Plan of action squabbles: The group hesitates as they decide what to do about the strange events. Someone suggests splitting up to look for the missing person or to gather supplies, while others argue it’s safer to stick together (High Plausibility Risk – “Let’s split up” is a notorious cliché that often frustrates viewers
studiobinder.com
, since real people would likely stay together when scared).

False reassurance: A character (often a parental figure or the skeptic) insists “Everything is under control” or “It’s just our imagination”, momentarily calming the group. This usually precedes another scare that proves them very wrong (Low Plausibility Risk – denial under stress is human, though the audience side-eyes their optimism).

Break into Two (Act II begins)

Point of no return: The protagonists become fully trapped in the situation. Common cliche: they discover the doors won’t open, the bridge is out, or their car has been sabotaged, physically locking them into the “house” with the monster (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a transparent contrivance to enforce isolation, but it’s essential for the premise).

Entering the darkness: The heroes consciously venture into the scariest area (basement, attic, woods) to confront the unknown or search for a friend, effectively entering the special world of Act II. They arm themselves with makeshift weapons (flashlights, a kitchen knife) despite lingering doubt (Low Plausibility Risk – the fight-or-flight response kicking in is believable, and someone has to take action).

First direct encounter: Act II often kicks off with the monster making a bold appearance now that the conflict is underway – for example, the creature attacks the group in the house foyer or the killer steps out of the shadows, forcing the characters to run or fight. From here on, the main conflict is explicit (Low Plausibility Risk, given the story’s promise).

Authority figure brushes it off: If the characters do manage to contact an authority (a cop, ranger, etc.), this person downplays the threat – maybe checking briefly and saying “It’s nothing, just stay indoors”. They leave (or are quickly dispatched by the monster), meaning the heroes are on their own (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s slightly contrived that officials wouldn’t take more action, but it’s a trope to keep the focus on the main characters).

Group decides to fight: Rather than continue debating, the survivors commit to facing the danger. A common beat is someone declaring “We have to take matters into our own hands”, marking the proactive shift. This leads directly into the “hide and seek” battles to come (Low Plausibility Risk).

B Story (Subplot & Character Bonds)

Budding romance under duress: Two characters share a tender moment or attraction amidst the chaos – perhaps patching up each other’s wounds or confessing “If we make it out, I owe you dinner.” A kiss or spark often happens around mid-story (Medium Plausibility Risk – adrenaline and fear can trigger emotional bonding, though cynics might question making googly eyes while a monster roams).

Partner conflict and trust: If the story involves partners or buddies (buddy-cop or siblings etc.), the subplot often features them overcoming a rift. Cliché: they argue over past issues (blame for a mistake, differing methods) until the situation forces them to trust each other, strengthening their bond (Low Plausibility Risk – stress can bring grievances out, but also forge camaraderie).

Mentor or expert enters: A knowledgeable secondary character (priest, scientist, local historian) appears or is consulted, providing backstory or a possible solution (the “lore dump” about what the monster is and how to stop it). This B story element guides the heroes (Medium Plausibility Risk – convenient that someone has exactly the right knowledge, but it grounds the threat in rules).

Personal demons surface: The crisis triggers a character’s personal issue from the setup. For example, an alcoholic father figure struggles to stay sober to protect his family, or a cowardly character must face their lifelong fear. These personal arcs play out alongside monster battles (Low Plausibility Risk – realistic that extreme stress would bring internal struggles to a head, and it adds depth beyond the horror).

Comic relief coping: The jokester of the group continues quipping to keep spirits up, even as things get dangerous (e.g. cracking a one-liner after a narrow escape). This subplots as a coping mechanism and can lighten the tone (Medium Plausibility Risk – nervous humor is real, but if overdone it can feel tonally off when lives are on the line).

Fun and Games (Act II – “The Promise of the Premise”)

Exploring the unknown: Characters roam the locale in search of answers or survivors, often splitting into pairs or wandering off alone despite the danger (High Plausibility Risk – the audience knows wandering alone is dumb, yet horror characters keep doing it to facilitate scares).

“Don’t go in there!” moments: Time and again, a character approaches a dark room, creepy basement, or noise in the attic, despite every horror fan yelling at the screen. They’ll slowly open a creaking door or ask “Hello? Who’s there?” into the darkness, effectively inviting a jump scare
studiobinder.com
medium.com
 (High Plausibility Risk – realistic people would not announce themselves to a killer, making this a much-mocked trope).

False jump scares: A tense build-up (eerie music, character trembling) results in something benign – e.g. a cat leaps out of a closet, or it was just a friend tapping their shoulder. Everyone sighs in relief… until the real threat strikes moments later (Medium Plausibility Risk – a well-worn technique to toy with audience nerves; effective but obviously manufactured).

One-by-one eliminations: Supporting characters are picked off sequentially. Typically, a minor character wanders off for a trivial reason (to fetch cigarettes, go to the bathroom, investigate a weird sound alone) and the monster pounces on them in isolation (High Plausibility Risk – it stretches belief that people keep straying alone given what’s happening, but it’s a hallmark of the genre to dwindle the cast).

The monster in glimpses: During these early confrontations, the creature or killer is often shown only in quick flashes or hidden by shadows – maybe just a clawed hand grabbing a victim into the dark – preserving mystery (Low Plausibility Risk – the monster being elusive makes sense, and it heightens suspense).

Creepy clue discoveries: The heroes stumble on frightening evidence of the monster’s origin or past victims: diaries, photo albums, old newspaper clippings, bloodstains, or ritualistic symbols. These clues conveniently explain the “whydunit” (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a bit lucky that everything they need to know is lying around, but it provides the necessary exposition in-story).

Minor victories and setbacks: The group might attempt a small plan – like locking a door to contain the monster, or whacking it with a blunt object – and believe they’ve succeeded for a moment. Inevitably, the monster breaks free or was unharmed, dashing their brief hope (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s plausible to try simple defenses first, and equally plausible those wouldn’t stop a powerful creature).

Chase and stumble: A classic sequence involves a character being chased by the monster through the house/woods. Inevitably, the victim trips or makes a clumsy fall at the worst possible time, barely scrambling up before the monster closes in
studiobinder.com
 (High Plausibility Risk – although people can trip when terrified, this happens with comical frequency in films).

Stock scare locales: The story delivers set-piece scares in all the expected places: someone gets trapped in the basement with flickering lights, a mirror in the bathroom reveals something behind a character, a power outage plunges everything into darkness, or a thunderstorm rages as a backdrop to the horror (Low Plausibility Risk – these environmental tropes are accepted mood-setters, not really about realism).

Skeptic’s comeuppance: The die-hard skeptic of the group (who insisted “ghosts aren’t real”) finally encounters the ghost/monster directly. Often by the time they fully believe, it’s moments before their demise, fulfilling a kind of ironic justice (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s dramatically fitting and audiences expect the naysayer to eat their words, even if in reality people might wise up sooner with so many clues).

Character stereotypes in crisis: Each character reacts in clichéd ways when scared: the aggressive one tries to heroically fight and is overpowered, the coward hides or runs (possibly sacrificing others), the brainy character fumbles a logical plan under pressure. These reactions tick the boxes for their archetypes (Low Plausibility Risk – consistent with their setup personalities, though a bit on-the-nose).

Foreshadowing the weakness: Amid the chaos, there may be a subtle hint of the monster’s vulnerability – a throwaway detail like the creature recoiling from a ringing church bell or hesitating at the threshold of a room. It might go unnoticed by the characters now but sets up the method of defeat later (Low Plausibility Risk – planting clues is a sound narrative technique, not a plausibility issue).

Midpoint

False victory (the “eye of the storm”): Around the midpoint, the characters appear to defeat or escape the monster. For example, they manage to stab the killer and he collapses, or they lock the demon in the cellar. They breathe a sigh of relief and think “Maybe it’s over” (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s reasonable they’d hope the danger is past, though savvy viewers know it’s too early for the end).

Sudden game-changer: Conversely, a twist at the midpoint makes things much worse – False defeat. A major character could die unexpectedly, or a new threat is revealed (e.g. there were two killers all along, or the monster has a second form). The stakes skyrocket (Low Plausibility Risk – raising the stakes with a surprise is dramatically effective and doesn’t defy logic if foreshadowed).

“We’re in deep trouble” revelation: The surviving characters learn something significant that reframes the conflict. For instance, they discover the haunting is tied to their own past misdeed, or that the monster can’t be killed by ordinary means. A common midpoint cliche in mysteries: finding the old diary/newspaper that explains why the monster is terrorizing them (Medium Plausibility Risk – the info dump can feel convenient, but it gives story context).

Crossing A and B stories: The midpoint often merges the main horror plot with the personal subplot. For example, the love interest is snatched by the monster (making the fight now personal and external), or the hero’s fear (B story) causes a critical mistake in battling the creature. This intersection intensifies the drama (Low Plausibility Risk – thematically neat and expected in screenplay structure).

Hopeful moment or romance beat: Often there’s a brief optimistic beat (“calm before the storm”) here – perhaps two characters share a passionate kiss believing they might die soon, or an authority figure promises help is on the way. Blake Snyder famously calls it the “~Kiss at 60~” if a love subplot exists. This hope spot gives contrast before things darken again (Medium Plausibility Risk – heightened emotions in crisis can lead to sudden romance or hope, but it’s a trope the audience sees coming).

Monster upping the ante: If the first half showed restraint, at midpoint the monster may show its full form or a new ability. For instance, the gentle ghost turns violent, or the slasher who used a knife now sets the house on fire. This removes any doubt that “fun and games” are over (Low Plausibility Risk – logical escalation of the antagonist’s intensity as the story turns).

Bad Guys Close In (Act II – Second Half)

Rising body count: In this phase, the monster (or antagonist forces) intensifies attacks. Any remaining secondary characters are likely picked off in quick or brutal succession. Each loss hits the group harder – e.g. “We’re dropping like flies!” becomes evident (Low Plausibility Risk – as the threat escalates, casualties mount realistically within the story’s logic).

Internal strife: Fear and stress ignite conflicts among the survivors. They may start blaming each other for the situation (“This is your fault we’re here!”) or argue over what to do next. Paranoia sets in, sometimes leading to accusations that one of them is secretly involved with the monster (especially in a whodunit or paranoia thriller scenario) (Low Plausibility Risk – stress causing infighting is very plausible, though it conveniently heightens drama at the worst time).

Betrayal or cowardice: A desperate character might try to save themselves at others’ expense – for example, attempting to flee alone, locking others out, or considering sacrificing someone to appease the monster. This selfish act usually fails or backfires (Medium Plausibility Risk – sadly, not everyone would act nobly in real life either, though the trope often telegraphs who the “coward” is).

The bitten/possessed secret: In monster or zombie tales, one character hides that they’ve been infected, cursed, or possessed. They conceal symptoms (bite marks, strange behavior) until it worsens and endangers the group at a critical moment (Medium Plausibility Risk – while deceit in fear is believable, audiences are very familiar with the “don’t hide your zombie bite” cliché).

Siege and fortification: The group often attempts to barricade or fortify a safe room to ride out the threat (“Let’s board up the windows and stay quiet”). This plan might work briefly, but the relentless monster finds a way in or flushes them out (Low Plausibility Risk – fortifying is sensible, and a powerful monster breaching it is expected).

Outside help fails: If any glimmer of outside rescue appears (police sirens, a friend arriving), it quickly turns sour. Commonly the would-be rescuer is killed moments after appearing, or the phone connection with authorities is lost as things get critical. The story ensures no cavalry is coming (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s contrived that every help ends badly, but it maintains isolation; audiences typically roll with it).

Monster’s dominance: The antagonist seems to be one step ahead at all times now. Traps the heroes set misfire, and every escape route gets cut off. For example, if they have a car fixed, the monster blocks the road; if they stay together, something forces them apart. The feeling is that the monster is tightening the noose (Low Plausibility Risk – within genre logic, the villain’s upper hand simply builds dread, though if overdone the monster can seem omnipotent).

Revelation of the “sin”: Often the fundamental wrongdoing (or cause of the horror) is fully exposed here. Perhaps the group learns that one of them read the cursed book aloud or that the house was built on graves because a family member desecrated it. This “dark secret revealed” adds guilt and gravity – possibly the characters turn on the one responsible (Medium Plausibility Risk – secrets coming out under pressure is believable, though timing-wise it’s clearly to set up atonement later).

All seems futile: By now the heroes’ initial plans (barricading, straightforward fighting) have all failed. Dialogue like “Nothing can stop it!” or “We’re never getting out alive” may be uttered, underscoring the hopelessness just before the lowest point (Low Plausibility Risk as a storytelling beat, since it captures their mindset).

Terror peaks: The scares in this segment are often the most intense. E.g., a character might be dragged away screaming while others watch helplessly, or the monster lurks just inches away from a hiding hero who struggles to stay silent. These moments pay off the suspense built so far (Low Plausibility Risk – the monster is at its strongest, so these high-octane terror scenes make sense).

All Is Lost (Act II Climax – The Low Point)

Major death – “Whiff of death”: A key ally or beloved character dies, delivering an emotional gut-punch. Often it’s the mentor, love interest, or the last friend of the hero. This is the whiff of death moment where the story’s tone is darkest
ericiansteele.com
. For example, the hero might find their best friend’s corpse or witness their sacrifice in vain (Low Plausibility Risk – casualties are expected, though it’s formulaic that this happens right on cue).

Ultimate failure of plan: The characters’ best-laid plan to defeat the monster utterly fails at this point. If they had a weapon or ritual prepared, it backfires (the weapon breaks, the ritual is interrupted). “It’s no use…” sums up their feelings as their last hope crumbles (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s logical the first big plan might not succeed against a formidable foe, heightening the drama).

Complete isolation: By now the hero is usually alone or nearly alone. Any remaining companion might be incapacitated or believed dead. The hero stands in the wreckage (perhaps literally, if the location is burning or ruined) with seemingly no resources left. It looks like evil has won (Low Plausibility Risk – a natural culmination of the monster picking everyone off).

The villain’s mercy (or mistake): In some cases, the monster could have the hero at its mercy and, inexplicably, doesn’t finish them off. Instead of killing the hero outright, it might knock them unconscious, toy with them, or leave them for later. This trope allows the story to continue but strains logic if not justified (High Plausibility Risk – audiences often ask why the monster/villain didn’t end it here when they had the chance).

Symbolic defeat: There may be a symbolic death or loss – e.g. the destruction of a cherished item or the place they considered safe (like the house itself starts collapsing). It’s a visual cue that all they valued is in jeopardy. For instance, the family home going up in flames as the hero fails to save a loved one inside (Low Plausibility Risk as symbolism, since external chaos mirrors the hero’s despair).

“Darkest before dawn” imagery: Often this beat happens in the literal darkest part of night. The scene might emphasize midnight or the predawn gloom, implying that if they can survive past this, there’s a chance at light. But right now, it’s darkness and defeat all around (Low Plausibility Risk – just a thematic detail).

Hero’s lowest moment: The protagonist might momentarily give up here. We might see them sobbing, screaming “No!” over a loss, or sinking to their knees in exhaustion. This emotional breakdown underlines that they’ve hit rock bottom (Low Plausibility Risk – a genuine human reaction to trauma and loss, expected in drama).

Audience gut reaction: This beat often aligns with the audience’s feeling that the situation is as bad as it can get. It’s the classic moment in horror where one might think “How on earth will they survive now?” – not a specific on-screen cliché, but a structural one that sets up the final act.

Dark Night of the Soul (Reflection Before Act III)

Despair and introspection: In the aftermath of “All is Lost,” the hero experiences despair. A common cliche is the hero weeping or whispering apologies to a fallen friend (“I’m so sorry... I should have listened…”). They might contemplate defeat or even pray for strength despite never being religious before (Low Plausibility Risk – a believable emotional collapse and search for hope after trauma).

Renewed determination: Something triggers the hero to find their resolve. This could be an encouraging memory (a flashback to a loved one’s advice), or noticing a meaningful object (e.g. a family photo, reminding them what they fight for). The hero’s expression shifts from grief to grim determination, often wiping their tears away and steeling themselves (Low Plausibility Risk – people can find second wind from emotional catalysts, though the timing is conveniently right when needed).

Epiphany or clue: The hero realizes the key to defeating the monster during this low moment. Perhaps they recall a detail from the monster’s lore or a line of dialogue earlier that reveals its weakness (“Sunlight!” or “It can’t cross running water!”). This “lightbulb moment” is a trope that pivots the story toward solution (Medium Plausibility Risk – the insight often arrives a bit magically when needed, but usually it’s based on previously shown info, so audiences accept the aha moment).

Inner flaw confronted: As per Save the Cat formula, the hero comes to terms with their personal flaw here. For example, the coward finds courage, the selfish person chooses selflessness, or the guilt-ridden character forgives themselves. They might say something like “No more running away” to themselves. It’s a cathartic beat that readies them for the final battle (Low Plausibility Risk – an internal turning point is emotionally satisfying and not about realism).

Last survivors band together: If more than one character is left (say the hero and one other wounded ally), this is where they reconcile fully and vow to fight on. Perhaps they exchange a meaningful nod or a line like “We finish this together.” Past conflicts are set aside entirely (Low Plausibility Risk – extreme circumstances can absolutely bury grudges, and this unifying moment is expected).

Preparing for the final round: The hero might take a quiet moment to tend to their injuries, jury-rig a weapon, or load a final shotgun shell, montage-style. This solemn preparation, done in silence or with tense music, signals that the final confrontation is imminent (Low Plausibility Risk – practical and dramatic, as long as the ease of prepping isn’t too far-fetched).

Silence before the storm: There’s often a noticeable lull – a silent, eerie calm as the hero moves with resolve, contrasting all the chaos prior. For instance, the hero might slowly walk through the destroyed house, eyes fixed ahead, no jump scares at this specific beat, giving the audience and character a breath to focus (Low Plausibility Risk – a pacing choice more than a plausibility issue).

Break into Three (Act III – The Final Plan)

“Eureka” plan: Armed with new insight, the hero formulates a last-ditch plan to defeat the monster. Often it involves using a weakness discovered or a resource previously seen. Example cliche: “If I can lure it into the basement and set it on fire...” or “We have to get it into the sunlight somehow.” This plan is clearly different from what was tried before (Low Plausibility Risk – necessity breeds creativity, and using Chekhov’s gun from earlier is satisfying storytelling).

Improvised arsenal: The hero (and any surviving allies) gather whatever tools or weapons are at hand, even jury-rigging traps. There might be a quick montage of tying a sharp object to a stick, mixing chemicals to make an explosive, or loading a single bullet into a damaged gun. They likely deliver a determined one-liner: “Let’s do this.” (Medium Plausibility Risk – people can improvise under pressure, but complex trap-making in minutes or having just the right supplies is a bit of a stretch often glossed over by the film’s momentum).

Redemption of the guilty: If a character’s prior mistake or “sin” caused the horror, that character (if still alive) now seeks redemption. A cliché is them volunteering for a suicide mission or bait: “I started this. I’ll buy you time to finish it.” They may or may not survive, but their willingness to atone is highlighted (Low Plausibility Risk – guilt can drive heroic sacrifice, a trope but emotionally logical).

The unexpected ally: Sometimes a presumed-dead or absent ally returns at this turning point to help. Perhaps a friend thought to be killed crawls out injured but alive, or a secondary character like the local sheriff reappears after escaping their earlier peril. This bolsters the hero’s chance (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a convenient save, but if the character’s death was off-screen or ambiguous, audiences accept they could plausibly still be alive).

Hero embraces their arc: In Break into Three, the protagonist often demonstrates they’ve overcome their personal flaw in devising the plan. For instance, the formerly timid person now acts with leadership and decisiveness, or the one who always ran now stands and fights. They might explicitly acknowledge it: “No more running. It ends now.” (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s the payoff of the character arc, a story beat rather than a realism concern).

Steeling for battle: This moment frequently features a line or gesture of resolve – the hero cocks the shotgun, lights a Molotov cocktail, or tightens the bandage on their wound, symbolizing they’re ready to face the monster one last time. The music might swell heroically for the first time. It’s a clear tonal shift to offensive strategy (Low Plausibility Risk – a natural lead-in to the climax).

Time constraint trope: Sometimes an extra urgency is introduced: dawn is approaching (which could either save them or be too late for something), or a building is moments from collapsing. The hero’s plan must work now or never. This adds tension going into the finale (Low Plausibility Risk – heightening urgency is common and acceptable as long as it’s not an out-of-nowhere contrivance).

Finale (Act III Climax – Final Confrontation)

Final showdown location: The confrontation often moves to a significant or symbolic location – the basement, the rooftop, back to where it all started, or some confined “arena” for the last fight. For instance, the hero deliberately lures the monster into the house’s living room rigged with traps (Low Plausibility Risk).

Cat-and-mouse climax: The finale typically involves a tense cat-and-mouse sequence. The hero stalks the monster as much as it stalks them. Classic cliche: the hero hides, holding breath as the monster prowls, then vice versa when the hero sets off their trap and the monster is on the back foot. The power dynamic swings (Low Plausibility Risk – consistent with the life-or-death chess match feel of a climax).

Villain monologue or taunt: If the antagonist is sentient (say a killer or intelligent creature), they might corner the hero and gloat or explain their motives instead of killing immediately. “You should have died with the rest… but I want you to witness this.” This gives the hero time or insight to turn the tables (High Plausibility Risk – a well-known trope where the baddie’s need to talk undermines their efficiency, but it’s often used to reveal important info or give the hero an opening).

Hero’s clever trick: The hero uses ingenuity rather than sheer force to win. Clichés include: pretending to be dead or defeated until the monster lets its guard down, using the environment (like electrocuting the water the monster stands in), or recalling a specific weakness (dousing the zombie in gasoline then igniting it). The trick catches the monster off-guard (Low Plausibility Risk – intelligent problem-solving by the hero is believable and rewarding for the audience, as long as the solution fits what’s been established).

Chekhov’s Gun payoff: Something planted early in the film now pays off decisively. For example, the unusual antique sword on the wall that was innocuously shown in Act I is finally grabbed to slay the demon, or a lullaby that a child character sang now soothes the possessed spirit. This is a common satisfying trope (Low Plausibility Risk – audiences love when earlier details logically come into play now).

Hero almost loses: Even in the finale, the hero often gets overpowered or injured, nearly meeting their end. Perhaps the monster has them in a chokehold or the killer pins them down. It seems all might be lost again… until a last-second save or surge of strength (Medium Plausibility Risk – the back-and-forth struggle adds tension, though multiple fake-outs can feel manipulative if done excessively).

Last-second ally save: Frequently, just as the monster overwhelms the hero, an unexpected assist happens – e.g. the previously wounded friend reappears to shoot the monster, or the hero’s dog bites the villain, distracting them. This teamwork allows the hero to finish the job (Medium Plausibility Risk – dramatic timing of an ally’s return is obviously scripted, but within story, an injured friend regaining consciousness at the right moment is possible).

“One-liner kill”: Right before delivering the final blow, the hero delivers a quip or resonant line. For example: “Smile, you son of a—” (cut off by explosion), or “Go to hell,” as they unleash the killshot. This crowd-pleasing cliché punctuates the victory (Medium Plausibility Risk – in reality people might not have a snappy line in such a moment, but action/horror films often indulge in it for flair).

Double-tap (or lack thereof): Savvy heroes might “double tap” and ensure the monster is truly dead. However, the classic cliché is NOT doing this – the hero assumes the antagonist is finished after one defeat. If they fail to double-tap, it often leads to… (High Plausibility Risk – when heroes drop their guard prematurely, viewers often cringe because it’s unbelievably careless
medium.com
).

“One last scare” resurrection: …the monster suddenly comes back for one final attack when everyone thinks it’s over
studiobinder.com
. This could be the killer’s eyes snapping open or the creature lunging up again after seemingly dying. The hero (or a surviving ally) must then decisively kill it again to end the threat for good (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a blatant genre trope to get an extra jolt, often stretching credibility since the monster withstood fatal damage, but audiences have come to expect it in horror finales).

Evil vanquished: Ultimately, the monster is destroyed or neutralized in a spectacular or definitive way. Common cliches: exploding into flames, impaled on something symbolic (like a church spire or their own weapon), melting into goo, or being banished by a ritual with a scream. The threat is over and often the entire “house” (setting) is wrecked or ablaze in the process, purging the evil (Low Plausibility Risk – as long as the method aligns with established rules, the over-the-top demise is welcomed catharsis).

Final girl/boy standing: Typically only the hero (and maybe one other character) is left alive at the end of the confrontation. This final survivor trope is so expected that in a group of characters, audiences often predict who it will be. The classic scenario is the shy or unlikely character has become the lone victor who outsmarted the monster (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s statistically possible only one survives, and narrative convention supports the most virtuous or resourceful surviving).

Resolution / Final Image

Aftermath and rescue: In the aftermath, we often see the hero stumbling out into safety. If it’s night, now dawn is breaking. A standard image: the survivor wrapped in a blanket, sitting on an ambulance bumper or back of an open ambulance, while police/officers mill about. They are in shock as authorities finally arrive after the carnage (Low Plausibility Risk – emergency response coming in once everything’s over is plausible timing, if a bit convenient that they weren’t there during the mayhem).

Traumatized survivor: The hero’s thousand-yard stare or tearful breakdown highlights the emotional cost. They might be asked questions by paramedics or police, but be too dazed to respond. This cliche final beat shows that though they survived, they are forever changed (Low Plausibility Risk – a realistic portrayal of post-trauma, expected by audiences).

Revealed strength or change: We see how the hero has grown. The timid girl now walks upright and determined, or the flawed protagonist shows a sign of their arc completion (maybe reconciling with a family member, or symbolically discarding their alcohol flask, etc.). A subtle nod might indicate they’ve overcome the personal demon that haunted them, not just the literal monster (Low Plausibility Risk – character growth payoff, not a credibility issue).

Last ironic echo: Some films like to echo the opening in the final image. For example, if the opening image was the house looking peaceful, the closing image might show the house charred and silent in the morning light. Or the hero’s happy family photo shown in Act I is seen again, now blood-splattered or being carried with them as they leave. This visual bookend is noticeable but effective (Low Plausibility Risk – purely stylistic).

Authorities don’t get it: Occasionally, the resolution includes police or news reporters offering a mundane explanation for the event (blaming a gas explosion or a bear attack), implying that outsiders will never truly know what happened. The hero often stays quiet about the fantastical truth, or isn’t believed if they try to explain (Medium Plausibility Risk – authorities might indeed seek a rational explanation, but it’s a trope that no one believes the survivor’s story of a supernatural ordeal).

Sequel bait / lingering evil: A final horror stinger may be present. Perhaps as the hero is taken away, the camera reveals a subtle sign that the evil persists – an item connected to the monster is missing from the evidence, an evil eye opens in the rubble, or a slight supernatural sound plays as the final image. This “the end… or is it?” moment leaves the audience with lingering unease (Medium Plausibility Risk – it undermines the finality of the hero’s victory, but it’s a common horror cliche to tease that evil can return).

Bittersweet victory: In many cases, the resolution isn’t overtly cheerful. The hero might have survived but at great cost (friends/family gone, home destroyed). A cliche is them asking a rescuer “Is it really over?” and not receiving a clear answer, or delivering a somber line like “We’re safe now… I think.” The final shot might focus on the hero’s face, attempting a smile that fades, conveying relief tainted by trauma (Low Plausibility Risk – emotionally authentic that it’s not all smiles, and audiences appreciate a tone that acknowledges the darkness of what happened).

Roll credits relief: Ultimately, the audience is left with a mix of relief (the monster is defeated) and maybe a tiny seed of doubt (if a final scare or sequel hook was shown). This is the typical ending beat of a Monster in the House story, satisfying the narrative while keeping the suspense alive just a touch longer. (No plausibility issue – it’s about leaving the theater with a last thrill or thought).

Each of these cliches corresponds to a beat in the Save the Cat! “Monster in the House” structure, and the plausibility risk labels reflect how much each trope might stretch audience credibility. Many are genre staples (low risk) that viewers willingly accept, while others require the audience to suspend disbelief or forgive character logic (medium risk), and a few are so overused or illogical that they often draw criticism or eye-rolls (high risk). By being aware of these, writers can decide which to embrace for their familiarity and which to subvert or justify better to maintain narrative integrity and keep the audience immersed in the story.

Quantize THESE into a single sentence each:

Monster in the House Beat Sheet Cliches (Plausibility Ranked)
Opening Image / Prologue
Cold-open victim: A minor character is introduced only to be killed in a prelude scare, establishing the monster’s threat early (Low Plausibility Risk – audiences expect an opening jolt).
Eerie establishing shot: A long ominous pan of the “house” (cabin, town, spaceship, etc.) accompanied by creepy music or thunder, immediately signaling dread (Low Plausibility Risk).
Ignorant introduction: The protagonist or group is shown in normalcy (e.g. cheerfully driving to a remote location at night) blissfully unaware of danger, sometimes even picking up a mysterious hitchhiker despite the spooky circumstances (Medium Plausibility Risk – characters seem oblivious, but it sets the stage).
Foreshadowing lore: An opening voiceover, text, or local legend hints at the dark history of the place or monster (“No one who enters these woods returns…”), laying out the curse or creature backstory (Low Plausibility Risk – a conventional horror setup device).
“It was just a dream” tease: The film opens with a terrifying scene that turns out to be a protagonist’s nightmare or imagination, before they wake up in bed (Medium Plausibility Risk – can feel like a cheap trick if overused, but it does convey the looming danger).
Set-Up (Act I Introduction)
“New home, new start” scenario: Characters arrive at or move into an obviously creepy or history-laden house (or town) but completely ignore/red-flag its ominous vibe or reputation (Low Plausibility Risk – horror protagonists often need a reason to be in the haunted locale).
Ominous local warning: A quirky local, neighbor, or old caretaker delivers a vague warning or says something like “You folks be careful out there” about the place/monster, which the protagonists politely dismiss as superstition (Medium Plausibility Risk – plausible they’d shrug it off, though the foreshadowing is obvious).
Personal demon foreshadowed: The hero’s personal weakness or trauma is introduced (e.g. fear of responsibility, a tragic loss, or a past “sin” like a mistake that will tie into the monster’s origin). This Save-the-Cat moment hints at the inner journey to come (Low Plausibility Risk – a standard narrative setup device, not usually viewed as a realism issue).
Group dynamics clichés: The characters fall into familiar roles during introductions – e.g. the nerd, the jock, the comic relief, the shy “final” girl – often with lighthearted banter before things go bad (Low Plausibility Risk, as audiences accept archetypes, though it’s tropey).
Ignored creepy clues: Early minor signs of danger are shrugged off – the dog barking at nothing, strange house noises (blamed on “old pipes or the wind”), or a creepy doll left behind that no one throws out (Medium Plausibility Risk – people might investigate such signs more in reality, but horror characters often rationalize them).
Urban legend exposition: A character shares a local myth or gruesome story about the setting (“They say this place was built on a graveyard…”) which everyone laughs off or downplays (Low Plausibility Risk – delivering backstory through campfire tale is common and accepted).
Save the Cat moment: The protagonist performs a small act of kindness or likeability (befriending a child, rescuing a cat, etc.) to gain audience sympathy in the calm before the storm (Low Plausibility Risk – purely a storytelling device, it doesn’t strain credibility).
Catalyst
Unwittingly unleashing evil: The group inadvertently provokes the monster or curse – for example, reading the forbidden incantation, playing with a Ouija board, or disturbing a sealed door “just for fun” (Medium Plausibility Risk – it requires characters to do the one thing they shouldn’t, but curiosity or skepticism can make it semi-believable).
The first victim disappears/dies: A side character goes missing or is found dead under mysterious circumstances, marking the monster’s first strike (Low Plausibility Risk – a logical inciting incident to kick off the horror, typically accepted by audiences).
Sin trigger: A character commits a “sin” that metaphorically invites the monster – e.g. ignoring a safety rule, pursuing greedy or lustful behavior, or breaking a cultural taboo tied to the location. This act sets the supernatural vengeance in motion (Low Plausibility Risk – fits the moral framework of Monster in the House stories).
Haunting call or sign: The catalyst can be a creepy message or sign from the antagonist – a bloody symbol on the wall, a distorted phone call from a dead relative, or an object moving on its own – clearly signaling that an otherworldly threat has arrived (Medium Plausibility Risk, since characters might doubt their senses at first, but it’s a staple to escalate the plot).
“The monster is real” moment: The protagonists catch their first fleeting glimpse of the monster or threat (a shadow lunging, eyes in the darkness, etc.), giving them a jolt. They may question what they saw, but the audience knows the hunt is on (Low Plausibility Risk).
Debate
Denial and rationalization: In the aftermath of the catalyst, characters debate what happened – Was it a prank? An animal? – clinging to normal explanations. The skeptic of the group insists “There’s no such thing as monsters” despite mounting odd evidence (Low Plausibility Risk – people often deny frightening realities initially).
“We should leave!” vs. “We can’t!”: A split opinion forms: one character urges everyone to flee immediately or call police, while another gives reasons to stay put – “It’s probably nothing,” or “We can’t just abandon the project/friends”. Often practical constraints like a storm or lost car keys conveniently force them to hunker down anyway (Medium Plausibility Risk – characters debating logical escape is natural, but circumstances always prevent the easy way out).
Convenient isolation (no help coming): Attempts to get outside help fail: the phone has no signal or a dead battery exactly when needed​
learnenglish.britishcouncil.org
, and the car won’t start or the only bridge out has collapsed. This strands the characters with the threat (Medium Plausibility Risk – mechanical failures at perfect timing require some disbelief, but audiences tolerate them to get the plot truly confined).
Plan of action squabbles: The group hesitates as they decide what to do about the strange events. Someone suggests splitting up to look for the missing person or to gather supplies, while others argue it’s safer to stick together (High Plausibility Risk – “Let’s split up” is a notorious cliché that often frustrates viewers​
studiobinder.com
, since real people would likely stay together when scared).
False reassurance: A character (often a parental figure or the skeptic) insists “Everything is under control” or “It’s just our imagination”, momentarily calming the group. This usually precedes another scare that proves them very wrong (Low Plausibility Risk – denial under stress is human, though the audience side-eyes their optimism).
Break into Two (Act II begins)
Point of no return: The protagonists become fully trapped in the situation. Common cliche: they discover the doors won’t open, the bridge is out, or their car has been sabotaged, physically locking them into the “house” with the monster (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a transparent contrivance to enforce isolation, but it’s essential for the premise).
Entering the darkness: The heroes consciously venture into the scariest area (basement, attic, woods) to confront the unknown or search for a friend, effectively entering the special world of Act II. They arm themselves with makeshift weapons (flashlights, a kitchen knife) despite lingering doubt (Low Plausibility Risk – the fight-or-flight response kicking in is believable, and someone has to take action).
First direct encounter: Act II often kicks off with the monster making a bold appearance now that the conflict is underway – for example, the creature attacks the group in the house foyer or the killer steps out of the shadows, forcing the characters to run or fight. From here on, the main conflict is explicit (Low Plausibility Risk, given the story’s promise).
Authority figure brushes it off: If the characters do manage to contact an authority (a cop, ranger, etc.), this person downplays the threat – maybe checking briefly and saying “It’s nothing, just stay indoors”. They leave (or are quickly dispatched by the monster), meaning the heroes are on their own (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s slightly contrived that officials wouldn’t take more action, but it’s a trope to keep the focus on the main characters).
Group decides to fight: Rather than continue debating, the survivors commit to facing the danger. A common beat is someone declaring “We have to take matters into our own hands”, marking the proactive shift. This leads directly into the “hide and seek” battles to come (Low Plausibility Risk).
B Story (Subplot & Character Bonds)
Budding romance under duress: Two characters share a tender moment or attraction amidst the chaos – perhaps patching up each other’s wounds or confessing “If we make it out, I owe you dinner.” A kiss or spark often happens around mid-story (Medium Plausibility Risk – adrenaline and fear can trigger emotional bonding, though cynics might question making googly eyes while a monster roams).
Partner conflict and trust: If the story involves partners or buddies (buddy-cop or siblings etc.), the subplot often features them overcoming a rift. Cliché: they argue over past issues (blame for a mistake, differing methods) until the situation forces them to trust each other, strengthening their bond (Low Plausibility Risk – stress can bring grievances out, but also forge camaraderie).
Mentor or expert enters: A knowledgeable secondary character (priest, scientist, local historian) appears or is consulted, providing backstory or a possible solution (the “lore dump” about what the monster is and how to stop it). This B story element guides the heroes (Medium Plausibility Risk – convenient that someone has exactly the right knowledge, but it grounds the threat in rules).
Personal demons surface: The crisis triggers a character’s personal issue from the setup. For example, an alcoholic father figure struggles to stay sober to protect his family, or a cowardly character must face their lifelong fear. These personal arcs play out alongside monster battles (Low Plausibility Risk – realistic that extreme stress would bring internal struggles to a head, and it adds depth beyond the horror).
Comic relief coping: The jokester of the group continues quipping to keep spirits up, even as things get dangerous (e.g. cracking a one-liner after a narrow escape). This subplots as a coping mechanism and can lighten the tone (Medium Plausibility Risk – nervous humor is real, but if overdone it can feel tonally off when lives are on the line).
Fun and Games (Act II – “The Promise of the Premise”)
Exploring the unknown: Characters roam the locale in search of answers or survivors, often splitting into pairs or wandering off alone despite the danger (High Plausibility Risk – the audience knows wandering alone is dumb, yet horror characters keep doing it to facilitate scares).
“Don’t go in there!” moments: Time and again, a character approaches a dark room, creepy basement, or noise in the attic, despite every horror fan yelling at the screen. They’ll slowly open a creaking door or ask “Hello? Who’s there?” into the darkness, effectively inviting a jump scare​

 (High Plausibility Risk – realistic people would not announce themselves to a killer, making this a much-mocked trope).
False jump scares: A tense build-up (eerie music, character trembling) results in something benign – e.g. a cat leaps out of a closet, or it was just a friend tapping their shoulder. Everyone sighs in relief… until the real threat strikes moments later (Medium Plausibility Risk – a well-worn technique to toy with audience nerves; effective but obviously manufactured).
One-by-one eliminations: Supporting characters are picked off sequentially. Typically, a minor character wanders off for a trivial reason (to fetch cigarettes, go to the bathroom, investigate a weird sound alone) and the monster pounces on them in isolation (High Plausibility Risk – it stretches belief that people keep straying alone given what’s happening, but it’s a hallmark of the genre to dwindle the cast).
The monster in glimpses: During these early confrontations, the creature or killer is often shown only in quick flashes or hidden by shadows – maybe just a clawed hand grabbing a victim into the dark – preserving mystery (Low Plausibility Risk – the monster being elusive makes sense, and it heightens suspense).
Creepy clue discoveries: The heroes stumble on frightening evidence of the monster’s origin or past victims: diaries, photo albums, old newspaper clippings, bloodstains, or ritualistic symbols. These clues conveniently explain the “whydunit” (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a bit lucky that everything they need to know is lying around, but it provides the necessary exposition in-story).
Minor victories and setbacks: The group might attempt a small plan – like locking a door to contain the monster, or whacking it with a blunt object – and believe they’ve succeeded for a moment. Inevitably, the monster breaks free or was unharmed, dashing their brief hope (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s plausible to try simple defenses first, and equally plausible those wouldn’t stop a powerful creature).
Chase and stumble: A classic sequence involves a character being chased by the monster through the house/woods. Inevitably, the victim trips or makes a clumsy fall at the worst possible time, barely scrambling up before the monster closes in​
studiobinder.com
 (High Plausibility Risk – although people can trip when terrified, this happens with comical frequency in films).
Stock scare locales: The story delivers set-piece scares in all the expected places: someone gets trapped in the basement with flickering lights, a mirror in the bathroom reveals something behind a character, a power outage plunges everything into darkness, or a thunderstorm rages as a backdrop to the horror (Low Plausibility Risk – these environmental tropes are accepted mood-setters, not really about realism).
Skeptic’s comeuppance: The die-hard skeptic of the group (who insisted “ghosts aren’t real”) finally encounters the ghost/monster directly. Often by the time they fully believe, it’s moments before their demise, fulfilling a kind of ironic justice (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s dramatically fitting and audiences expect the naysayer to eat their words, even if in reality people might wise up sooner with so many clues).
Character stereotypes in crisis: Each character reacts in clichéd ways when scared: the aggressive one tries to heroically fight and is overpowered, the coward hides or runs (possibly sacrificing others), the brainy character fumbles a logical plan under pressure. These reactions tick the boxes for their archetypes (Low Plausibility Risk – consistent with their setup personalities, though a bit on-the-nose).
Foreshadowing the weakness: Amid the chaos, there may be a subtle hint of the monster’s vulnerability – a throwaway detail like the creature recoiling from a ringing church bell or hesitating at the threshold of a room. It might go unnoticed by the characters now but sets up the method of defeat later (Low Plausibility Risk – planting clues is a sound narrative technique, not a plausibility issue).
Midpoint
False victory (the “eye of the storm”): Around the midpoint, the characters appear to defeat or escape the monster. For example, they manage to stab the killer and he collapses, or they lock the demon in the cellar. They breathe a sigh of relief and think “Maybe it’s over” (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s reasonable they’d hope the danger is past, though savvy viewers know it’s too early for the end).
Sudden game-changer: Conversely, a twist at the midpoint makes things much worse – False defeat. A major character could die unexpectedly, or a new threat is revealed (e.g. there were two killers all along, or the monster has a second form). The stakes skyrocket (Low Plausibility Risk – raising the stakes with a surprise is dramatically effective and doesn’t defy logic if foreshadowed).
“We’re in deep trouble” revelation: The surviving characters learn something significant that reframes the conflict. For instance, they discover the haunting is tied to their own past misdeed, or that the monster can’t be killed by ordinary means. A common midpoint cliche in mysteries: finding the old diary/newspaper that explains why the monster is terrorizing them (Medium Plausibility Risk – the info dump can feel convenient, but it gives story context).
Crossing A and B stories: The midpoint often merges the main horror plot with the personal subplot. For example, the love interest is snatched by the monster (making the fight now personal and external), or the hero’s fear (B story) causes a critical mistake in battling the creature. This intersection intensifies the drama (Low Plausibility Risk – thematically neat and expected in screenplay structure).
Hopeful moment or romance beat: Often there’s a brief optimistic beat (“calm before the storm”) here – perhaps two characters share a passionate kiss believing they might die soon, or an authority figure promises help is on the way. Blake Snyder famously calls it the “Kiss at 60” if a love subplot exists. This hope spot gives contrast before things darken again (Medium Plausibility Risk – heightened emotions in crisis can lead to sudden romance or hope, but it’s a trope the audience sees coming).
Monster upping the ante: If the first half showed restraint, at midpoint the monster may show its full form or a new ability. For instance, the gentle ghost turns violent, or the slasher who used a knife now sets the house on fire. This removes any doubt that “fun and games” are over (Low Plausibility Risk – logical escalation of the antagonist’s intensity as the story turns).
Bad Guys Close In (Act II – Second Half)
Rising body count: In this phase, the monster (or antagonist forces) intensifies attacks. Any remaining secondary characters are likely picked off in quick or brutal succession. Each loss hits the group harder – e.g. “We’re dropping like flies!” becomes evident (Low Plausibility Risk – as the threat escalates, casualties mount realistically within the story’s logic).
Internal strife: Fear and stress ignite conflicts among the survivors. They may start blaming each other for the situation (“This is your fault we’re here!”) or argue over what to do next. Paranoia sets in, sometimes leading to accusations that one of them is secretly involved with the monster (especially in a whodunit or paranoia thriller scenario) (Low Plausibility Risk – stress causing infighting is very plausible, though it conveniently heightens drama at the worst time).
Betrayal or cowardice: A desperate character might try to save themselves at others’ expense – for example, attempting to flee alone, locking others out, or considering sacrificing someone to appease the monster. This selfish act usually fails or backfires (Medium Plausibility Risk – sadly, not everyone would act nobly in real life either, though the trope often telegraphs who the “coward” is).
The bitten/possessed secret: In monster or zombie tales, one character hides that they’ve been infected, cursed, or possessed. They conceal symptoms (bite marks, strange behavior) until it worsens and endangers the group at a critical moment (Medium Plausibility Risk – while deceit in fear is believable, audiences are very familiar with the “don’t hide your zombie bite” cliché).
Siege and fortification: The group often attempts to barricade or fortify a safe room to ride out the threat (“Let’s board up the windows and stay quiet”). This plan might work briefly, but the relentless monster finds a way in or flushes them out (Low Plausibility Risk – fortifying is sensible, and a powerful monster breaching it is expected).
Outside help fails: If any glimmer of outside rescue appears (police sirens, a friend arriving), it quickly turns sour. Commonly the would-be rescuer is killed moments after appearing, or the phone connection with authorities is lost as things get critical. The story ensures no cavalry is coming (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s contrived that every help ends badly, but it maintains isolation; audiences typically roll with it).
Monster’s dominance: The antagonist seems to be one step ahead at all times now. Traps the heroes set misfire, and every escape route gets cut off. For example, if they have a car fixed, the monster blocks the road; if they stay together, something forces them apart. The feeling is that the monster is tightening the noose (Low Plausibility Risk – within genre logic, the villain’s upper hand simply builds dread, though if overdone the monster can seem omnipotent).
Revelation of the “sin”: Often the fundamental wrongdoing (or cause of the horror) is fully exposed here. Perhaps the group learns that one of them read the cursed book aloud or that the house was built on graves because a family member desecrated it. This “dark secret revealed” adds guilt and gravity – possibly the characters turn on the one responsible (Medium Plausibility Risk – secrets coming out under pressure is believable, though timing-wise it’s clearly to set up atonement later).
All seems futile: By now the heroes’ initial plans (barricading, straightforward fighting) have all failed. Dialogue like “Nothing can stop it!” or “We’re never getting out alive” may be uttered, underscoring the hopelessness just before the lowest point (Low Plausibility Risk as a storytelling beat, since it captures their mindset).
Terror peaks: The scares in this segment are often the most intense. E.g., a character might be dragged away screaming while others watch helplessly, or the monster lurks just inches away from a hiding hero who struggles to stay silent. These moments pay off the suspense built so far (Low Plausibility Risk – the monster is at its strongest, so these high-octane terror scenes make sense).
All Is Lost (Act II Climax – The Low Point)
Major death – “Whiff of death”: A key ally or beloved character dies, delivering an emotional gut-punch. Often it’s the mentor, love interest, or the last friend of the hero. This is the whiff of death moment where the story’s tone is darkest​
ericiansteele.com
. For example, the hero might find their best friend’s corpse or witness their sacrifice in vain (Low Plausibility Risk – casualties are expected, though it’s formulaic that this happens right on cue).
Ultimate failure of plan: The characters’ best-laid plan to defeat the monster utterly fails at this point. If they had a weapon or ritual prepared, it backfires (the weapon breaks, the ritual is interrupted). “It’s no use…” sums up their feelings as their last hope crumbles (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s logical the first big plan might not succeed against a formidable foe, heightening the drama).
Complete isolation: By now the hero is usually alone or nearly alone. Any remaining companion might be incapacitated or believed dead. The hero stands in the wreckage (perhaps literally, if the location is burning or ruined) with seemingly no resources left. It looks like evil has won (Low Plausibility Risk – a natural culmination of the monster picking everyone off).
The villain’s mercy (or mistake): In some cases, the monster could have the hero at its mercy and, inexplicably, doesn’t finish them off. Instead of killing the hero outright, it might knock them unconscious, toy with them, or leave them for later. This trope allows the story to continue but strains logic if not justified (High Plausibility Risk – audiences often ask why the monster/villain didn’t end it here when they had the chance).
Symbolic defeat: There may be a symbolic death or loss – e.g. the destruction of a cherished item or the place they considered safe (like the house itself starts collapsing). It’s a visual cue that all they valued is in jeopardy. For instance, the family home going up in flames as the hero fails to save a loved one inside (Low Plausibility Risk as symbolism, since external chaos mirrors the hero’s despair).
“Darkest before dawn” imagery: Often this beat happens in the literal darkest part of night. The scene might emphasize midnight or the predawn gloom, implying that if they can survive past this, there’s a chance at light. But right now, it’s darkness and defeat all around (Low Plausibility Risk – just a thematic detail).
Hero’s lowest moment: The protagonist might momentarily give up here. We might see them sobbing, screaming “No!” over a loss, or sinking to their knees in exhaustion. This emotional breakdown underlines that they’ve hit rock bottom (Low Plausibility Risk – a genuine human reaction to trauma and loss, expected in drama).
Audience gut reaction: This beat often aligns with the audience’s feeling that the situation is as bad as it can get. It’s the classic moment in horror where one might think “How on earth will they survive now?” – not a specific on-screen cliché, but a structural one that sets up the final act.
Dark Night of the Soul (Reflection Before Act III)
Despair and introspection: In the aftermath of “All is Lost,” the hero experiences despair. A common cliche is the hero weeping or whispering apologies to a fallen friend (“I’m so sorry... I should have listened…”). They might contemplate defeat or even pray for strength despite never being religious before (Low Plausibility Risk – a believable emotional collapse and search for hope after trauma).
Renewed determination: Something triggers the hero to find their resolve. This could be an encouraging memory (a flashback to a loved one’s advice), or noticing a meaningful object (e.g. a family photo, reminding them what they fight for). The hero’s expression shifts from grief to grim determination, often wiping their tears away and steeling themselves (Low Plausibility Risk – people can find second wind from emotional catalysts, though the timing is conveniently right when needed).
Epiphany or clue: The hero realizes the key to defeating the monster during this low moment. Perhaps they recall a detail from the monster’s lore or a line of dialogue earlier that reveals its weakness (“Sunlight!” or “It can’t cross running water!”). This “lightbulb moment” is a trope that pivots the story toward solution (Medium Plausibility Risk – the insight often arrives a bit magically when needed, but usually it’s based on previously shown info, so audiences accept the aha moment).
Inner flaw confronted: As per Save the Cat formula, the hero comes to terms with their personal flaw here. For example, the coward finds courage, the selfish person chooses selflessness, or the guilt-ridden character forgives themselves. They might say something like “No more running away” to themselves. It’s a cathartic beat that readies them for the final battle (Low Plausibility Risk – an internal turning point is emotionally satisfying and not about realism).
Last survivors band together: If more than one character is left (say the hero and one other wounded ally), this is where they reconcile fully and vow to fight on. Perhaps they exchange a meaningful nod or a line like “We finish this together.” Past conflicts are set aside entirely (Low Plausibility Risk – extreme circumstances can absolutely bury grudges, and this unifying moment is expected).
Preparing for the final round: The hero might take a quiet moment to tend to their injuries, jury-rig a weapon, or load a final shotgun shell, montage-style. This solemn preparation, done in silence or with tense music, signals that the final confrontation is imminent (Low Plausibility Risk – practical and dramatic, as long as the ease of prepping isn’t too far-fetched).
Silence before the storm: There’s often a noticeable lull – a silent, eerie calm as the hero moves with resolve, contrasting all the chaos prior. For instance, the hero might slowly walk through the destroyed house, eyes fixed ahead, no jump scares at this specific beat, giving the audience and character a breath to focus (Low Plausibility Risk – a pacing choice more than a plausibility issue).
Break into Three (Act III – The Final Plan)
“Eureka” plan: Armed with new insight, the hero formulates a last-ditch plan to defeat the monster. Often it involves using a weakness discovered or a resource previously seen. Example cliche: “If I can lure it into the basement and set it on fire...” or “We have to get it into the sunlight somehow.” This plan is clearly different from what was tried before (Low Plausibility Risk – necessity breeds creativity, and using Chekhov’s gun from earlier is satisfying storytelling).
Improvised arsenal: The hero (and any surviving allies) gather whatever tools or weapons are at hand, even jury-rigging traps. There might be a quick montage of tying a sharp object to a stick, mixing chemicals to make an explosive, or loading a single bullet into a damaged gun. They likely deliver a determined one-liner: “Let’s do this.” (Medium Plausibility Risk – people can improvise under pressure, but complex trap-making in minutes or having just the right supplies is a bit of a stretch often glossed over by the film’s momentum).
Redemption of the guilty: If a character’s prior mistake or “sin” caused the horror, that character (if still alive) now seeks redemption. A cliché is them volunteering for a suicide mission or bait: “I started this. I’ll buy you time to finish it.” They may or may not survive, but their willingness to atone is highlighted (Low Plausibility Risk – guilt can drive heroic sacrifice, a trope but emotionally logical).
The unexpected ally: Sometimes a presumed-dead or absent ally returns at this turning point to help. Perhaps a friend thought to be killed crawls out injured but alive, or a secondary character like the local sheriff reappears after escaping their earlier peril. This bolsters the hero’s chance (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a convenient save, but if the character’s death was off-screen or ambiguous, audiences accept they could plausibly still be alive).
Hero embraces their arc: In Break into Three, the protagonist often demonstrates they’ve overcome their personal flaw in devising the plan. For instance, the formerly timid person now acts with leadership and decisiveness, or the one who always ran now stands and fights. They might explicitly acknowledge it: “No more running. It ends now.” (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s the payoff of the character arc, a story beat rather than a realism concern).
Steeling for battle: This moment frequently features a line or gesture of resolve – the hero cocks the shotgun, lights a Molotov cocktail, or tightens the bandage on their wound, symbolizing they’re ready to face the monster one last time. The music might swell heroically for the first time. It’s a clear tonal shift to offensive strategy (Low Plausibility Risk – a natural lead-in to the climax).
Time constraint trope: Sometimes an extra urgency is introduced: dawn is approaching (which could either save them or be too late for something), or a building is moments from collapsing. The hero’s plan must work now or never. This adds tension going into the finale (Low Plausibility Risk – heightening urgency is common and acceptable as long as it’s not an out-of-nowhere contrivance).
Finale (Act III Climax – Final Confrontation)
Final showdown location: The confrontation often moves to a significant or symbolic location – the basement, the rooftop, back to where it all started, or some confined “arena” for the last fight. For instance, the hero deliberately lures the monster into the house’s living room rigged with traps (Low Plausibility Risk).
Cat-and-mouse climax: The finale typically involves a tense cat-and-mouse sequence. The hero stalks the monster as much as it stalks them. Classic cliche: the hero hides, holding breath as the monster prowls, then vice versa when the hero sets off their trap and the monster is on the back foot. The power dynamic swings (Low Plausibility Risk – consistent with the life-or-death chess match feel of a climax).
Villain monologue or taunt: If the antagonist is sentient (say a killer or intelligent creature), they might corner the hero and gloat or explain their motives instead of killing immediately. “You should have died with the rest… but I want you to witness this.” This gives the hero time or insight to turn the tables (High Plausibility Risk – a well-known trope where the baddie’s need to talk undermines their efficiency, but it’s often used to reveal important info or give the hero an opening).
Hero’s clever trick: The hero uses ingenuity rather than sheer force to win. Clichés include: pretending to be dead or defeated until the monster lets its guard down, using the environment (like electrocuting the water the monster stands in), or recalling a specific weakness (dousing the zombie in gasoline then igniting it). The trick catches the monster off-guard (Low Plausibility Risk – intelligent problem-solving by the hero is believable and rewarding for the audience, as long as the solution fits what’s been established).
Chekhov’s Gun payoff: Something planted early in the film now pays off decisively. For example, the unusual antique sword on the wall that was innocuously shown in Act I is finally grabbed to slay the demon, or a lullaby that a child character sang now soothes the possessed spirit. This is a common satisfying trope (Low Plausibility Risk – audiences love when earlier details logically come into play now).
Hero almost loses: Even in the finale, the hero often gets overpowered or injured, nearly meeting their end. Perhaps the monster has them in a chokehold or the killer pins them down. It seems all might be lost again… until a last-second save or surge of strength (Medium Plausibility Risk – the back-and-forth struggle adds tension, though multiple fake-outs can feel manipulative if done excessively).
Last-second ally save: Frequently, just as the monster overwhelms the hero, an unexpected assist happens – e.g. the previously wounded friend reappears to shoot the monster, or the hero’s dog bites the villain, distracting them. This teamwork allows the hero to finish the job (Medium Plausibility Risk – dramatic timing of an ally’s return is obviously scripted, but within story, an injured friend regaining consciousness at the right moment is possible).
“One-liner kill”: Right before delivering the final blow, the hero delivers a quip or resonant line. For example: “Smile, you son of a—” (cut off by explosion), or “Go to hell,” as they unleash the killshot. This crowd-pleasing cliché punctuates the victory (Medium Plausibility Risk – in reality people might not have a snappy line in such a moment, but action/horror films often indulge in it for flair).
Double-tap (or lack thereof): Savvy heroes might “double tap” and ensure the monster is truly dead. However, the classic cliché is NOT doing this – the hero assumes the antagonist is finished after one defeat. If they fail to double-tap, it often leads to… (High Plausibility Risk – when heroes drop their guard prematurely, viewers often cringe because it’s unbelievably careless​
medium.com
).
“One last scare” resurrection: …the monster suddenly comes back for one final attack when everyone thinks it’s over​
studiobinder.com
. This could be the killer’s eyes snapping open or the creature lunging up again after seemingly dying. The hero (or a surviving ally) must then decisively kill it again to end the threat for good (Medium Plausibility Risk – it’s a blatant genre trope to get an extra jolt, often stretching credibility since the monster withstood fatal damage, but audiences have come to expect it in horror finales).
Evil vanquished: Ultimately, the monster is destroyed or neutralized in a spectacular or definitive way. Common cliches: exploding into flames, impaled on something symbolic (like a church spire or their own weapon), melting into goo, or being banished by a ritual with a scream. The threat is over and often the entire “house” (setting) is wrecked or ablaze in the process, purging the evil (Low Plausibility Risk – as long as the method aligns with established rules, the over-the-top demise is welcomed catharsis).
Final girl/boy standing: Typically only the hero (and maybe one other character) is left alive at the end of the confrontation. This final survivor trope is so expected that in a group of characters, audiences often predict who it will be. The classic scenario is the shy or unlikely character has become the lone victor who outsmarted the monster (Low Plausibility Risk – it’s statistically possible only one survives, and narrative convention supports the most virtuous or resourceful surviving).
Resolution / Final Image
Aftermath and rescue: In the aftermath, we often see the hero stumbling out into safety. If it’s night, now dawn is breaking. A standard image: the survivor wrapped in a blanket, sitting on an ambulance bumper or back of an open ambulance, while police/officers mill about. They are in shock as authorities finally arrive after the carnage (Low Plausibility Risk – emergency response coming in once everything’s over is plausible timing, if a bit convenient that they weren’t there during the mayhem).
Traumatized survivor: The hero’s thousand-yard stare or tearful breakdown highlights the emotional cost. They might be asked questions by paramedics or police, but be too dazed to respond. This cliche final beat shows that though they survived, they are forever changed (Low Plausibility Risk – a realistic portrayal of post-trauma, expected by audiences).
Revealed strength or change: We see how the hero has grown. The timid girl now walks upright and determined, or the flawed protagonist shows a sign of their arc completion (maybe reconciling with a family member, or symbolically discarding their alcohol flask, etc.). A subtle nod might indicate they’ve overcome the personal demon that haunted them, not just the literal monster (Low Plausibility Risk – character growth payoff, not a credibility issue).
Last ironic echo: Some films like to echo the opening in the final image. For example, if the opening image was the house looking peaceful, the closing image might show the house charred and silent in the morning light. Or the hero’s happy family photo shown in Act I is seen again, now blood-splattered or being carried with them as they leave. This visual bookend is noticeable but effective (Low Plausibility Risk – purely stylistic).
Authorities don’t get it: Occasionally, the resolution includes police or news reporters offering a mundane explanation for the event (blaming a gas explosion or a bear attack), implying that outsiders will never truly know what happened. The hero often stays quiet about the fantastical truth, or isn’t believed if they try to explain (Medium Plausibility Risk – authorities might indeed seek a rational explanation, but it’s a trope that no one believes the survivor’s story of a supernatural ordeal).
Sequel bait / lingering evil: A final horror stinger may be present. Perhaps as the hero is taken away, the camera reveals a subtle sign that the evil persists – an item connected to the monster is missing from the evidence, an evil eye opens in the rubble, or a slight supernatural sound plays as the final image. This “the end… or is it?” moment leaves the audience with lingering unease (Medium Plausibility Risk – it undermines the finality of the hero’s victory, but it’s a common horror cliche to tease that evil can return).
Bittersweet victory: In many cases, the resolution isn’t overtly cheerful. The hero might have survived but at great cost (friends/family gone, home destroyed). A cliche is them asking a rescuer “Is it really over?” and not receiving a clear answer, or delivering a somber line like “We’re safe now… I think.” The final shot might focus on the hero’s face, attempting a smile that fades, conveying relief tainted by trauma (Low Plausibility Risk – emotionally authentic that it’s not all smiles, and audiences appreciate a tone that acknowledges the darkness of what happened).
Roll credits relief: Ultimately, the audience is left with a mix of relief (the monster is defeated) and maybe a tiny seed of doubt (if a final scare or sequel hook was shown). This is the typical ending beat of a Monster in the House story, satisfying the narrative while keeping the suspense alive just a touch longer. (No plausibility issue – it’s about leaving the theater with a last thrill or thought).

ChatGPT:


Below is an integrated, single-sentence beat sheet for a Monster in the House story that weaves in relevant Hawaii, High School, Romance, Superhero, and Action-Movie clichés. Each beat includes one or more tropes with a plausibility score in parentheses for seamless reference.

Opening Image / Prologue

Cold-open victim: A minor character—perhaps a local tourist at a Hawaiian luau or a school kid on a field trip—is abruptly killed in a brief prelude to establish the monstrous threat (Low Plausibility Risk).

Eerie establishing shot: An ominous, slow pan of a deserted Hawaiian beachfront mansion or an isolated suburban school at twilight, accompanied by rumbling thunder or eerie synth, immediately sets a tone of impending dread (Low Plausibility Risk).

Ignorant introduction: The protagonists, whether a group of high-schoolers on a class trip or college students in a Hawaiian paradise, are shown carefree and oblivious—laughing in the car or at a pool party—while subtle, unnatural details hint at the looming horror (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Foreshadowing lore: A whispered local legend or a teacher’s offhand comment like “You break the rules, you pay the price” (or “No one who enters these cursed grounds returns…”) plants early ideas of supernatural consequence (Low Plausibility Risk).

“It was just a dream” tease: A terrifying, vivid nightmare—perhaps of a superhero-style showdown or a ghastly scene in a familiar high-school locker room—turns out to be a bad dream, leaving the audience uneasy about what’s real (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Set-Up (Act I Introduction)

“New home, new start” scenario: Characters arrive at a notorious location—a creaky Hawaiian estate, a supposedly haunted high school, or a sleek but foreboding urban apartment (a la superhero headquarters gone wrong)—and dismiss its eerie vibes as mere legends or inconvenience (Low Plausibility Risk).

Ominous local warning: A quirky local (an old Hawaiian neighbor, a wise school janitor, or a retired superhero mentor) warns, “You folks be careful out there,” which is casually dismissed as mere superstition (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Personal demon foreshadowed: The protagonist’s secret vulnerability—like a hidden fear of isolation from island life, a past academic failure in high school, or a deep personal trauma from a superhero’s origin—is introduced to hint at later growth (Low Plausibility Risk).

Group dynamics clichés: Archetypes emerge—a nerdy outsider, the jock, the cheerful rebel, or the lovelorn sidekick echoing classic high school films—and even a budding romance or unlikely buddy pairing (as seen in romance or Buddy Love stories) is established (Low Plausibility Risk).

Ignored creepy clues: Early, unsettling signs—such as a stray, barking dog on a desolate Hawaiian road, abnormal school bell chimes, a romantic partner’s uneasy glance, or unexplained power outages during an action sequence—are dismissed as quirks (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Urban legend exposition: A character casually recounts a rumor (perhaps that the land was cursed after a betrayal or that a once-great superhero fell from grace) that everyone laughs off until events prove otherwise (Low Plausibility Risk).

Save the Cat moment: The hero, whether a misunderstood local or a reluctant teen, performs a small act of kindness (rescuing a stranded tourist or helping a bullied classmate) to earn audience empathy before the horror escalates (Low Plausibility Risk).

Catalyst

Unwittingly unleashing evil: The group inadvertently triggers the curse or awakens the monster—such as by disturbing sacred Hawaiian ground, reading forbidden high-school graffiti about an ancient sin, or activating a hidden supervillain device—thereby breaking a taboo (Medium Plausibility Risk).

The first victim disappears/dies: A supporting character (a curious classmate, a visiting tourist, or even a minor superhero sidekick) is suddenly and mysteriously killed, confirming the supernatural threat (Low Plausibility Risk).

Sin trigger: A character’s transgression—whether it is a reckless act at a luau, defiant teenage behavior, a moment of arrogant excess by a would-be hero, or greed-driven misdeeds common in superhero lore—sets the monster’s vengeance in motion (Low Plausibility Risk).

“The monster is real” moment: The protagonists catch a fleeting glimpse of the monster—a shadowy figure on a high school hallway, a hulking creature among the palm trees, or a costumed villain lurking in urban darkness—confirming the horror’s reality (Low Plausibility Risk).

Debate

Denial and rationalization: In the wake of the catalyst, characters try to explain away the unexplainable—whether dismissing it as a prank at a luau, an overactive imagination in a high school setting, or a glitch in a superhero’s radar—insisting “There’s nothing here” (Low Plausibility Risk).

“We should leave!” vs. “We can’t!”: The group is split between those arguing to immediately flee the doomed setting (like abandoning a school trip or leaving a high-rise in a superhero crisis) and those citing practical constraints that force them to stay (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Convenient isolation: Attempts to contact help fail at critical moments (a dead cell phone signal on a remote island, a malfunctioning security system in a high school, or suddenly cut-off emergency lines in a city), leaving the group stranded (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Plan of action squabbles: Heated debates ensue over whether to split up or stay together—typically invoking the “let’s split up” trope that almost always leads to disaster (High Plausibility Risk).

False reassurance: A skeptical character urges calm with claims like “It’s just our imagination” or “Everything’s under control,” providing temporary comfort before another scare shatters that illusion (Low Plausibility Risk).

Break into Two (Act II Begins)

Point of no return: The protagonists discover a physical barrier (e.g., the door won’t open, a sabotaged car, a collapsed bridge) that traps them within the monster’s domain—be it a haunted Hawaiian house, a nightmarish high school, or a besieged city (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Entering the darkness: The heroes consciously enter the most terrifying part of the setting (a shadowy basement, a desolate island trail, or a dark urban alley) armed with makeshift weapons, signaling their commitment to fight (Low Plausibility Risk).

First direct encounter: The monster launches its first full-blown attack—be it a ghoulish creature, a vengeful spirit in a high school corridor, or an unleashed super-villain—forcing the characters to run or fight, confirming the horror is now unmistakable (Low Plausibility Risk).

Authority figure brushes it off: When contacted, a supposed expert (like a local cop, school principal, or government official) dismisses the threat as a misunderstanding, leaving the protagonists to fend for themselves (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Group decides to fight: The survivors, now unable to ignore the danger, collectively resolve, “We have to take matters into our own hands,” marking their commitment to confront the threat (Low Plausibility Risk).

B Story (Subplot & Character Bonds)

Budding romance under duress: Amid the chaos—whether during a school lockdown, a Hawaiian storm, or a superhero crisis—two characters share a tender, unexpected moment, like a kiss or a promise of loyalty (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Partner conflict and trust: Fractures within the group lead to bitter arguments that ultimately force estranged friends or allies (from a high school clique or superhero team) to reconcile (Low Plausibility Risk).

Mentor or expert enters: A secondary character—be it a wise local, a seasoned teacher, or an experienced crimefighter—enters to provide crucial background lore or strategies, often through an exposition dump (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Personal demons surface: The crisis forces characters to confront their internal struggles, like a student overcoming social fear or a superhero grappling with past loss, deepening their arcs (Low Plausibility Risk).

Comic relief coping: A character uses humor (quipping during a tense moment or making a self-deprecating remark about the absurdity of their situation) to momentarily diffuse tension (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Fun and Games (Act II – “The Promise of the Premise”)

Exploring the unknown: Characters split up to traverse creepy, evocative spaces (a forbidding Hawaiian jungle, a dark school hallway, or a shadowy city street) despite obvious danger (High Plausibility Risk).

“Don’t go in there!” moments: Repeatedly, a character hesitates at a dark room or creaking door while everyone knows that entering it guarantees a jump scare (High Plausibility Risk).

False jump scares: A build-up of tension leads to a benign scare (like a cat darting out), only to be immediately followed by a real monster attack (Medium Plausibility Risk).

One-by-one eliminations: Supporting characters are picked off sequentially after making the predictable mistake of venturing alone for trivial reasons (High Plausibility Risk).

The monster in glimpses: The creature is shown briefly—its claw in shadow or a flash of malevolent eyes—to maintain mystery and suspense (Low Plausibility Risk).

Creepy clue discoveries: Characters conveniently find evidence (diaries, photos, bloodstains) that explains the monster’s backstory or rules (Medium Plausibility Risk).

Reckless Actions and Aggressive Bragging (High Plausibility Risk – 3 alternatives): Characters engage in overblown, impetuous acts—such as speeding recklessly or boasting casually about violence—that strain credulity; Alternative: Portray such actions as desperate, calculated responses emerging from authentic internal turmoil.
3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Plausibility Risk – 2 alternatives): Relationships introduced under duress (e.g., a sudden kiss in crisis or a vague love interest) are often shallowly drawn; Alternative: Let romance evolve gradually through nuanced, emotionally driven interactions that reflect real vulnerability.
4.

[THEME-AFFECTING TROPES – Sorted from Least-to-Most Plausible Threat]
1. Fun and Games / Escalation (High Plausibility Risk – 3 alternatives): Sequences featuring reckless exploration of danger, such as characters splitting up, “don’t go in there” moments, false jump scares, and one-by-one eliminations, often stretch suspension of disbelief; Alternative: Replace such overused sequences with tension built through nuanced, atmospheric exploration that preserves mystery.
2. Opening and Expository Dialogue Tropes (High Plausibility Risk – 3 alternatives): Flashy, expository dialogue meant to explain the supernatural (e.g., “That's an alien, bruv – believe it!”) can feel unnatural and forced; Alternative: Use understated, context-rich dialogue that builds mystery and tension gradually.
3. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (High Plausibility Risk – 3 alternatives): Overtly exaggerated traits (like big glow-in-the-dark fangs and dark blue blood) risk caricaturing the threat; Alternative: Design aliens with subtle, mood-shifting or minimalist features that imply menace without overt displays.
4. Plot and Narrative Progression Tropes (High Plausibility Risk – 3 alternatives): Plot twists such as mass invasions following one kill often appear contrived; Alternative: Develop a complex escalation where each new threat deepens the mystery and challenges the survivors in a logically built-up way.
5. Debate and Isolation (Medium Plausibility Risk – 2 alternatives): Protagonists debating whether to flee or fight while conveniently isolated by technical failures can feel contrived; Alternative: Ground these moments in realistic, fragmented communication that naturally amplifies tension.
6. Break into Two / Confrontation (Medium Plausibility Risk – 2 alternatives): Structural beats like discovering a point-of-no-return or entering the monster’s lair can seem formulaic if overused; Alternative: Infuse these moments with organic, character-driven stakes that resonate with the established world.
7. Midpoint Twist (Medium Plausibility Risk – 2 alternatives): False victories or sudden escalations can come across as predictable; Alternative: Ensure twists emerge as a logical consequence of the characters’ actions and the established supernatural framework.
8. Finale – Confrontation (Medium Plausibility Risk – 2 alternatives): Overused tropes such as villain monologues or last-second ally saves can diminish the impact of the climax; Alternative: Rely on inventive, character-specific tactics and restrained exchanges that reflect the narrative’s internal logic.
9. Gang and Mugging Tropes (Medium Plausibility Risk – 2 alternatives): Depicting a teenage gang engaged in a mugging interrupted by an otherworldly event can feel gimmicky; Alternative: Portray such encounters as tense, context-driven disruptions that force characters to re-evaluate their roles.
10. World and Setting Establishment (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): Elements like a cold-open victim, an eerie establishing shot, and subtle foreshadowing effectively set a tone of imminent dread; Alternative: (Develop a single nuanced detail that hints at a hidden threat while establishing the normal world.)
11. Catalyst and Unleashing Evil (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): Inciting incidents that include an unwitting transgression, a sudden death, or a supernatural sign are accepted genre devices; Alternative: (Integrate a carefully structured trigger that logically initiates the horror.)
12. Bad Guys Close In (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): Rising body counts, internal strife, and mounting terror that isolate the characters effectively intensify dread; Alternative: (Use minimal, potent scares that incrementally erode hope.)
13. All Is Lost (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): Major deaths, failed plans, and complete isolation serve as the narrative’s nadir; Alternative: (Convey the depth of despair through one significant, symbolic moment.)
14. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): Moments of introspection and renewed resolve restore equilibrium for the protagonist; Alternative: (Highlight a single, pivotal internal breakthrough that logically transitions to the final act.)
15. Break into Three (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): The final plan, born from an “aha” moment and fueled by a time constraint, propels the climax; Alternative: (Anchor the plan in a single, well-foreshadowed insight.)
16. Resolution / Final Image (Low Plausibility Risk – 1 alternative): Aftermath scenes that show rescue, transformation, or lingering trauma effectively convey the story’s conclusion; Alternative: (End with one resonant, visual callback that encapsulates both change and continuity.)

[G. Overused Jump Scare Sequences (High Plausibility Risk) – 3 Alternatives] Frequent, predictable jump scares—such as characters exclaiming “Don’t go in there!” before a harmless reveal—disrupt narrative flow and strain credibility; Alternative 1: Replace predictable jumps with slow-building suspense that lets tension simmer before the real scare; Alternative 2: Use ambient sounds and minimal visuals to imply danger rather than overt, flashy scares; Alternative 3: Reserve jump scares for truly pivotal moments and intersperse them with quieter, character-driven suspense.  
[H. Chase and Stumble Sequences (High Plausibility Risk) – 3 Alternatives] Characters repeatedly tripping or stumbling during frantic chase scenes to heighten tension comes off as contrived and overused; Alternative 1: Portray chase sequences with realistic urgency and organic obstacles that naturally slow down or disrupt movement; Alternative 2: Use variations in camera movement and editing to simulate adrenaline without resorting to slapstick mishaps; Alternative 3: Integrate character-specific physical challenges during chases that feel earned rather than formulaic.

1. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Plausibility Risk): A long, atmospheric pan across a deserted setting instantly sets a foreboding mood; Alternative: Use a concise tracking shot that reveals subtle, unsettling details. 2.

Held Gaze (High Plausibility Risk): Prolonged, dramatic stares used to imply deep emotional connection often feel forced; Alternatives: Shorten eye contact to natural, fleeting glances that build over time, integrate subtle, context-driven exchanges instead of overlong staring, and use brief, meaningful looks interspersed with action to suggest connection without cliché. 9. Jump Cut Jumps (High Plausibility Risk): Frequent, predictable jump cuts or flash frames employed for jump scares break immersion; Alternatives: Replace abrupt jump cuts with gradual transitions that build tension, employ controlled cuts that shock less cheaply, and reserve jump cuts for truly pivotal moments to sustain narrative flow. 10. Overly Stylized Color Grading (High Plausibility Risk): Excessively saturated or neon color grading intended to signify the supernatural can appear gimmicky; Alternatives: Adopt a subtle, naturalistic color palette that enhances mood without overwhelming realism, use restrained grading to emphasize atmospheric tension rather than cartoonish visuals, and employ minimal, dynamic lighting shifts that support the narrative tone organically.

Stereotypes play a major role in daily life, and can affect one’s judgement and behaviour without conscious awareness. Once stereotypes are established, they can be difficult to change, as the brain will fit information per an existing stereotype. This can manifest by changes in perception of skin tone or facial emotion expression.[8] A lot of the misattribution is due to the lack of accurate information. This can arise from not receiving proper education on a subject or failures in memory.[8] When there are gaps in knowledge, the brain uses stereotypes and biases to fill in the gaps, especially if these implicit biases are accessible.[8] Counterstereotypes can play a role in updating memories that form these biases. By presenting counter-examples, people can reappraise their views as well as reconsolidate the memory traces related to the pre-existing stereotypes.[8]
Countersterotypes have been applied in research as an intervention to change implicit biases. It has been shown that simply negating a stereotype does not reduce implicit biases.[9] By presenting counterstereotypical exemplars, some research has found a short-term reduction in stereotypes.[10] It was successful in reducing bias by linking in-group members with negativity and out-group members with positivity, or by presenting counterstereotypical exemplars that participants strongly identified with.[10] Interactions with a stereotyped out-group aid individuals in forming their own counterstereotypical exemplars. By forming positive relationships with out-group members, individuals form positive attitudes towards them and reduce implicit biases previously formed by stereotypes.[9]
These techniques have been applied to many different stereotypes. In the medical field, researchers focus on reducing implicit biases. Many biases come in conflict of quality of care, with people of a certain age, weight, gender, race, and socio-economic status receiving lower quality of care.[11] Interventions have not been useful in reducing healthcare workers’ implicit biases toward patients with a certain weight.[12] In educational settings, counterstereotype interventions have been used to counteract the effects of gender stereotypes. Math performance by women improved when the test administrators were women competent in math, and more female students enrol in STEM subjects when female role models are presented.[13]
Besides counterstereotypic exemplars, other interventions to implicit biases are often examined, such as perspective-taking, stereotype replacement, individuating, and evaluative conditioning.[9][10]

    - Cliché: The narrative hinges on one big, convenient twist with little grounding in prior events.
    - Alternative 1: Root every plot turn in visible, character-driven decision-making (individuation of outcomes).
    - Alternative 2: Create perspective misalignments—different characters discover different aspects of the mystery, with truth emerging only through cooperation (perspective-taking).
    - Alternative 3: Allow moral ambiguity to complicate twists; reward character insight rather than convenience (counterstereotypical structure).

  5. Author Avatar and Beleaguered Assistant Tropes (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Cliché: The creator’s surrogate is the silent observer, or the assistant is the wise realist no one listens to.
    - Alternative 1: If autobiographical, cloak self-insertion behind unfamiliar cultural lenses or experiences to avoid audience bias (stereotype replacement).
    - Alternative 2: Let the assistant embody a counterstereotype—emotionally volatile, passionate, or impulsive—but capable (counterstereotypical exemplar).

  6. Big Damn Heroes Tropes (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Cliché: A sidelined character bursts in last-minute to save the group with perfect timing.
    - Alternative 1: Seed the rescue through earlier cooperative behaviors—moments where they’re dismissed or underestimated, setting up their return as credible (individuating trust).
    - Alternative 2: Ensure the rescue is flawed, costly, or emotionally messy, forcing characters to reckon with consequences afterward (perspective-taking).
    - Alternative 3: Tie the rescue into character development—someone acts not because they’re brave, but because they’re afraid and choose action anyway (evaluative conditioning).

  7. Video Credits Tropes (Low Risk – 1 Alternative)
    - Cliché: Closing credits as flashy music video montages.
    - Alternative: Use credits to deepen closure—quiet stills of key locations changed by the events, sound bridges from earlier character dialogue, or fragments of unresolved story threads (evaluative closure).

Plot
In 1932, identical twins and World War I veterans Smoke and Stack Moore return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, after years spent working for the Chicago Outfit. Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from racist landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings that blues music is supernatural.
The twins recruit pianist Delta Slim and singer Pearline (with whom Sammie becomes enamored) as performers, Smoke's estranged wife Annie as cook, local Chinese married shopkeepers Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, and field worker Cornbread as bouncer. Smoke and Annie argue over her belief in the occult, as Annie says her practices kept the twins safe, but Smoke bitterly reminds her of her failure to prevent their infant daughter's death. Meanwhile, Stack reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Mary, who passes for white. Mary resents Stack for abandoning her when he left for Chicago, which Stack says was to protect her. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant vampire Remmick flees from Choctaw vampire hunters and violently turns a married Klansmen couple into vampires.
At the joint's opening night, Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the entranced crowd. Hearing the performance from outside, Remmick and his minions offer money and music for entry. Suspicious, the twins refuse. Mary reminds Stack that the joint needs the income and meets Remmick outside, where she is turned. She returns inside and seduces Stack, lethally biting him. Smoke discovers the pair and repeatedly shoots Mary to no avail. She escapes as Stack dies, while Remmick attacks and turns Cornbread outside.
Smoke closes the joint early and dismisses the patrons, who are turned upon leaving, as is Bo. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie, deducing that their assailants are vampires, educates the survivors: only sunlight, silver, or wooden stakes can kill vampires; they cannot enter a building unless invited; and killing Remmick will neither save nor destroy those he has turned. Although Remmick shares the horde's memories, their personalities remain intact. Remmick, still unable to enter the bar, negotiates; he promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community. He says vampirism offers immortality, freedom, and escape from racism, warning that Hogwood, who secretly heads the local Klan, plans to attack the joint at dawn. When the survivors refuse his offer, Remmick threatens to attack Grace's daughter, Lisa, at her home. Grace, desperate and furious, invites the vampires inside the joint to keep them from Lisa.
In the ensuing battle, Grace is immolated after staking Bo, Delta Slim sacrifices himself, and Annie, upon being bitten, is euthanized by Smoke before she can turn. Mary, distraught over Annie's death, flees the joint. Smoke defeats Stack while Remmick turns Pearline and attacks Sammie, who smashes his silver guitar over Remmick's head, stunning the horde in shared pain. Smoke then stakes Remmick, who is incinerated along with the horde by the rising sun. Smoke urges Sammie to return home before he ambushes and kills Hogwood and the Klan, but is fatally shot. As he dies, Smoke witnesses a vision of Annie and their daughter. Meanwhile, despite his father's pleas to renounce music and seek salvation, Sammie leaves for Chicago and becomes a blues musician.
Sixty years later, an ageless Stack and Mary visit Sammie. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that Sammie would live in peace. After declining the couple's offer of immortality, Sammie performs for them. As they leave, Sammie admits that despite being haunted by that fateful night, until the carnage it was the greatest day of his life. Stack agrees, since it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time he ever truly felt free.

Low- & Medium-Plausibility Clichés Detected in Sinners (2025)

pgsql
Copy code
Sinners (Ryan Coogler, 2025)

  LOW-RISK CLICHÉS
    • 1. Enriched Character Archetypes  
        – Twins Smoke & Stack, the cautious herbalist Annie, the conflicted preacher’s-son Sammie, etc., are all familiar “types” (stoic soldier, healer, prodigal youth) but each carries layered back-stories, trauma from WWI, or cultural ties to blues folklore that deepen them beyond stock roles.

    • 2. Internal Conflict & Redemption  
        – Smoke’s guilt over his daughter’s death, Sammie’s struggle between sacred and “devil” music, and Mary’s shame in passing for white all power personal-growth arcs that run parallel to the vampire siege.

    • 15. Inevitable Consequence Catalyst  
        – The brothers’ decision to fund their juke joint with stolen mob cash and ignore local superstitions (plus Sammie’s un-blessed blues performance) logically summons Remmick’s supernatural threat.

    • 16. Visual Stillness Before Chaos  
        – The joint’s opening-night hush—dust motes floating in lamplight, patrons holding collective breath—precedes the music-induced spirit visitation and Remmick’s arrival.

    • 17. Earned Rescue Transition  
        – Final sunlight’s arrival isn’t deus-ex-machina; it’s earned by Sammie’s silver-guitar blow and Smoke’s sacrificial staking of Remmick, setting up dawn as the logical rescue.

    • 18. Solitary Transformation Moment  
        – Smoke alone with Annie’s body at the stove, realizing he must kill his turned twin, crystallizes his shift from entrepreneur to doomed protector.

    • 19. Symbolic Collapse of Hope  
        – Grace’s desperate invitation that lets vampires cross the threshold visually (and morally) shatters any illusion of safety.

    • 20. Evocative Environmental Mood  
        – Sweltering Delta nights, buzzing cicadas, and shotgun-shack interiors soak every frame in an oppressive, lived-in dread.

    • 21. Thematic Final Echo  
        – The 1990s coda circles back to blues legacy and immortality, echoing Sammie’s first transformative performance but with bittersweet perspective.

  MEDIUM-RISK CLICHÉS
    • 3. Evolving Romantic Subplots  
        – Sammie & Pearline’s tentative flirtations and Stack & Mary’s tragic reunion develop through music sessions and morally fraught choices, not instant chemistry.

    • 4. Integrated Mentors and Allies  
        – Annie’s hoodoo knowledge and Delta Slim’s blues lore offer guidance seeded by earlier kitchen and rehearsal scenes, avoiding last-minute exposition.

    • 22. Foreshadowed Peripheral Victory  
        – The silver-stringed guitar—introduced as Sammie’s prized possession—becomes the key weapon, and Cornbread’s bouncer skills foreshadow his stand before turning.

    • 23. Preparatory Rhythmic Montage  
        – A night-before defense sequence shows characters blessing doorways, whittling stakes, and filling jars with pickled garlic juice, cut to Göransson’s delta-blues heartbeat.

    • 24. False Hope at Midpoint  
        – The heroes believe the barred juke joint and garlic traps will hold; the audience sees subtle cracks (Grace’s fear for her daughter) that telegraph the coming breach.

    • 25. Character-Driven Chase Stakes  
        – Smoke’s shotgun pursuit of Mary through moonlit cotton rows parallels his inner chase to reclaim family honor.

    • 26. Minimalist Slow Motion  
        – Used sparingly: bullets glide through lantern-lit dust when Smoke first fires at Mary, emphasizing the surreal shattering of kinship.

    • 27. Purposeful Subjective Camera  
        – A brief, woozy POV shot from Stack’s perspective on turning underscores blood-lust without disorienting the viewer.

    • 41. Chase Geometry with Emotion  
        – Remmick herding townsfolk toward the sunrise-blocked exit maps physical peril onto the characters’ dread of oppression and eternal night.

    • 42. Montage as Collective Action  
        – Cutaways between Slim tuning the piano, Annie mixing herbs, and Smoke loading silver buckshot bind the group in a shared mission.

    • 43. Purposeful Slow Motion (reinforced)  
        – The sunrise ignition of Remmick and hive is slowed just enough to let faces register horror, triumph, and loss.

    • 44. Grounded Subjective Focus  
        – Shallow depth isolates Sammie’s trembling hands on the fretboard as blues riffs summon spirits, visualizing his conflicted faith.

(High-risk clichés from the master list—e.g., “Predictable Jump Scares,” “Over-Stylized Color Grading,” “One-Liner Heroics”—do **not** appear or are consciously averted in *Sinners*.)

Sinners (Ryan Coogler, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke as the disillusioned protector, Annie as the grounded healer, Sammie as the conflicted prodigy.
    - These roles start archetypal but gain layered motives, contradictions, and emotional depth.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke’s unresolved grief, Mary’s guilt over passing, Stack’s moral fracture.
    - Each internal struggle is meaningfully tied to the story’s theme of community sacrifice and legacy.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie and Pearline’s tender courtship; Stack and Mary’s mournful rekindling.
    - These arcs evolve from shared pain, trust, and temptation rather than genre-convenient chemistry.

  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Annie’s knowledge of folk defense; Delta Slim’s blues mysticism.
    - Their support emerges from existing roles and accumulated wisdom, not plot convenience.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie’s transcendent performance unwittingly draws spirits and Remmick’s attention.
    - The threat rises organically from character-driven actions rooted in legacy and desire.

  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: A hushed joint before Sammie plays; a still field before sunrise.
    - Stillness and ambient tension precede every major eruption of violence or possession.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke’s death followed by Sammie’s walk into daylight.
    - The tonal descent into loss is resolved by quiet survival, not cinematic excess.

  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke cradling Annie before euthanizing her.
    - A moment of internal collapse anchors the moral cost of the fight.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Grace’s invitation breaks the safety threshold; Slim dies at the keys.
    - This beat is visualized as both physical defeat and emotional devastation.

  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The blues circle closes when Sammie plays for the vampires who spared him.
    - A visual and thematic callback to his transformative first performance.

  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Sammie smashing the silver guitar—long foreshadowed—as the pivotal act.
    - The climax is driven by a previously marginalized character completing a hidden arc.

  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Montage of community prepping garlic, silver, and spiritual protections.
    - Grounded in character skills and communal memory, not genre shorthand.

  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Belief that vampire-proofing is sufficient, just before betrayal and threshold breach.
    - Hints of doubt are subtly planted before the safety collapses.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Panning over cotton fields, the sawmill, and the moonlit road to the joint.
    - These shots set tone without over-explanation, using natural detail to induce dread.

  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Still wide shot of the dance floor before Remmick’s arrival.
    - Cinematic calm used for maximum foreboding, not spectacle.

  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sammie performing for Stack mirrors his youthful first gig.
    - Cinematic closure is earned via image, not narration or exposition.

  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Smoke chasing Mary through sugarcane lit by lanterns.
    - Movement and geography reflect character intent, not just plot propulsion.

  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Characters sealing cracks, loading buckshot, mixing herbs.
    - Rhythmically cut but grounded in action that reflects emotional readiness.

  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Silver strings snapping as Sammie swings his guitar.
    - Used once, with emotional weight—never gratuitously.

  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV when Stack turns vampire, surrounded by blurred memory flashes.
    - Emotional and symbolic rather than disorienting.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  21. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Remmick’s unsettling stillness, pale Irish corpse-features, understated menace.
    - Horror is suggested through silence, posture, and unnatural behavior, not exaggeration.

  22. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Use of a silver-stringed guitar and pickled garlic juice.
    - Iconic tools tied directly to the characters’ culture and available resources.

  23. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)

Marvel Studios first teased the formation of a Thunderbolts team within the MCU in 2021. The film was revealed to be in development in June 2022, when Schreier and Pearson were attached. The main cast was revealed in September, with additional casting through early 2023. Lee Sung Jin joined to rewrite the script by March 2023, one of several creatives who returned to work with Schreier from the Netflix series Beef (2023–present). Production was delayed due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, causing some cast changes in early 2024. Calo joined by then for further rewrites. Filming took place from February to June 2024 at Trilith Studios and Atlanta Metro Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and also on location in Utah and Kuala Lumpur.
Thunderbolts* premiered on April 22, 2025, at the Cineworld Leicester Square in London, England, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the final film of Phase Five of the MCU. The film's ending reveals that the Thunderbolts team is rebranded as the "New Avengers", with the end credits revealing the asterisk in the film's title stands for The New Avengers; following the film's opening weekend, Marvel Studios began marketing it with that title. Thunderbolts* received positive reviews from critics, and has grossed $177.3 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2025.
Plot
In Malaysia, Yelena Belova destroys a laboratory on behalf of CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to conceal her involvement with the O.X.E. Group's "Sentry" superhuman project. As de Fontaine faces imminent impeachment for her work with O.X.E. Group, she dispatches Yelena, John Walker, Ava Starr, and Taskmaster to a covert O.X.E. facility under the pretense of a mission. Once there, the operatives are pitted against one another in a deadly confrontation where Ava kills Taskmaster before they unexpectedly discover a mysterious man named Bob. Upon learning that they were sent by de Fontaine to be incinerated along with any evidence of her misconduct, they manage to escape from the trap.
De Fontaine learns that the group has survived, including Bob, who was presumed dead during the Sentry trials. When she arrives at the site, Bob creates a diversion by drawing enemy fire, allowing Yelena, Walker, and Ava to escape, only to sustain no injuries despite being shot. Bob then uncontrollably ascends into the air before passing out and crash-landing back at the compound, where he is captured and transported to the former Avengers Tower in New York City, now renamed the "Watchtower". De Fontaine intends to introduce Bob to the press as a super-powered protector akin to the Avengers, hoping the PR stunt will avert her impeachment. Meanwhile, Alexei Shostakov, who had overheard details of de Fontaine's plot while working as a freelance chauffeur, rescues Yelena, Walker, and Ava. Inspired by Yelena's childhood soccer team, Shostakov refers to the group as the "Thunderbolts".
The Thunderbolts are pursued by de Fontaine's agents before they are ultimately apprehended by Bucky Barnes, who intends to have them testify in the impeachment proceedings. Upon learning that Bob was a subject of one of de Fontaine's top-secret experiments, Barnes joins forces with the group to head to New York to infiltrate the Watchtower. The Thunderbolts discover that de Fontaine has turned Bob into an immensely powerful superhuman known as the Sentry, who easily overpowers the team and forces them to retreat. As the Sentry develops a god-like delusion of superiority, he turns on de Fontaine. However, her assistant, Mel, incapacitates him with a failsafe kill switch. This triggers the emergence of the Sentry's destructive alter ego, the Void, who begins engulfing New York City in supernatural darkness, trapping its citizens in pocket dimensions based on their worst memories.
Realizing the only way to stop the Void is from within, Yelena enters the darkness to reach Bob's consciousness. There, she faces her haunted past as a Black Widow and finds Bob hiding in a recreation of his childhood bedroom, where his father abused him. They are soon joined by the other Thunderbolts, and together they travel back to the memory of Bob's initial experimentation in Malaysia, where he volunteered for the procedure, hoping to improve himself after becoming an aimless drug addict. The Thunderbolts confront the Void, but are swiftly overpowered. As the struggle threatens to fully consume Bob, the team intervenes, affirming their belief in him. Their solidarity empowers Bob to regain control, overcoming the Void as light and normality return to the city.
With the threat neutralized, the Thunderbolts prepare to apprehend de Fontaine. However, she manipulates public perception by staging a press conference in which she rebrands them as the New Avengers. The Thunderbolts reluctantly agree, but Yelena threatens de Fontaine if she betrays them again. In a post-credits scene, the New Avengers and Bob discuss an ongoing problem in outer space[b] when they receive a distress signal from an interdimensional spacecraft with a large "4" emblem.[c]

Plot
edit
Nathan Caine is a mild-mannered introvert with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) working as an assistant manager at a trust credit union in San Diego. His co-worker Sherry Margrave is romantically interested in him, but Nathan is hesitant due to his condition and inexperience with women. At a bar with Sherry, Nathan encounters his middle-school bully, who calls him "Novocaine". Sherry gets revenge for Nathan by tricking the bully into drinking a shot of hot sauce; the two then have sex.
The next morning, on Christmas Eve, a gang of robbers dressed up in Santa suits led by Simon Greenly rob the credit union. Simon murders Nathan's boss Nigel and takes Sherry as a hostage. Nathan impulsively steals a police car in pursuit of the car in which Sherry is being held, but he follows the wrong car and ends up in a confrontation with another robber, Ben Clark, in a restaurant kitchen. He eventually shoots Ben dead, but not before severely burning his hand while retrieving Ben's gun from a deep fryer.
After noticing Ben's tattoo, Nathan asks his only friend, Roscoe Dixon, a gamer whom he has never met in person, to help him find the artist. He successfully tracks down the artist, Zeno, and interrogates him for Ben's address, hoping to find Sherry. After a brawl, Nathan obtains Ben's last name from Zeno, and he calls a colleague to find Ben's home address using his loan documents. Ben's house is booby-trapped, and Nathan ends up stuck in a snare; in desperation, he calls Roscoe. Ben's brother Andre enters the house and begins to torture Nathan, who feigns feeling pain. Roscoe arrives, and together they overpower and kill Andre. Police officer Mincy Langston and her partner Coltraine Duffy arrive at the house and arrest Roscoe, who has switched clothes with Nathan.
Nathan locates Sherry and Simon at an auto shop and discovers she is Simon's adoptive sister and an accomplice to the heist; she originally intended to seduce Nathan to learn the bank vault code but developed real feelings for him (and was horrified that Simon needlessly murdered her boss, Nigel). Simon tries to kill Nathan against Sherry's protests, but he is shot by an arriving Coltraine, while Sherry and Nathan are arrested. Simon in turn shoots Coltraine dead and wounds Mincy, escaping in the ambulance holding Nathan. Sherry frees herself from the handcuffs, and she pursues the ambulance while Roscoe drives a wounded Mincy to the hospital.
After regaining consciousness, Nathan breaks free from the handcuffs and defibrillates Simon, causing him to crash. Having had enough of Nathan, Simon breaks his arm just as Sherry arrives. As he is about to kill Sherry, Nathan injects himself with adrenaline and kills Simon by sticking his exposed arm bone through Simon's jaw before falling unconscious, finally exhausted by his injuries.
When Nathan awakes in a hospital two weeks later, he learns he has been sentenced to six months of house arrest and five years of probation instead of a lengthy prison sentence due to his saving the life of the police officer whose car he took to pursue Sherry as well as Roscoe and Sherry providing support as character witnesses.
One year later, Nathan visits Sherry, who is near the end of a short sentence for her role in the robbery. They share a cherry pie, which Sherry had introduced him to on their first date (the first solid food Nathan had eaten in a long time). As the prison guards lead Sherry back to her cell, Nathan chews and smiles.

Maybe I'm being unclear. Use this format for Thunderbolts* as and example (in plain-text within code fences):

Thunderbolts* (Jake Schreier, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Yelena as the disillusioned assassin, Bob as the traumatized superhuman, Walker as the disgraced patriot.
    - These roles start archetypal but gain layered motives, contradictions, and emotional depth.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Bob's internal struggle with the Void, Yelena's confrontation with her past as a Black Widow.
    - Each internal struggle is meaningfully tied to the story’s theme of identity and control.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Subtle dynamics, such as the camaraderie between team members, develop organically.
    - These arcs evolve from shared pain, trust, and mutual understanding rather than genre-convenient chemistry.

  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Alexei Shostakov (Red Guardian) provides guidance and support, aiding the team's cohesion and mission success.
    - Their support emerges from existing roles and accumulated wisdom, not plot convenience.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Valentina's manipulation and the activation of Bob's powers inadvertently unleash the Void.
    - The threat rises organically from character-driven actions rooted in legacy and desire.

  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moments of calm, such as the team's brief respite before confronting the Void, heighten the tension and underscore impending danger.
    - Stillness and ambient tension precede every major eruption of violence or possession.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Following the Void's defeat, the team's emergence into a restored New York symbolizes renewal and the possibility of redemption.
    - The tonal descent into loss is resolved by quiet survival, not cinematic excess.

  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Bob's internal battle within the Void's realm represents a profound personal crisis, pivotal to the narrative's resolution.
    - A moment of internal collapse anchors the moral cost of the fight.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: The team's initial defeat by the Sentry and the subsequent emergence of the Void convey a sense of hopelessness before their eventual triumph.
    - This beat is visualized as both physical defeat and emotional devastation.

  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The rebranding of the Thunderbolts as the New Avengers at the film's conclusion mirrors earlier themes of identity and transformation.
    - A visual and thematic callback to their transformative journey.

  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bob, initially perceived as a liability, ultimately overcomes his inner demons to save the team and the city.
    - The climax is driven by a previously marginalized character completing a hidden arc.

  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The team's coordinated efforts to confront the Void, including strategizing and arming themselves, are depicted through concise, purposeful sequences.
    - Grounded in character skills and communal memory, not genre shorthand.

  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The temporary subdual of the Sentry provides a fleeting sense of success before the more formidable threat of the Void emerges.
    - Hints of doubt are subtly planted before the safety collapses.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Visuals of the Watchtower and the encroaching darkness of the Void establish an ominous atmosphere.
    - These shots set tone without over-explanation, using natural detail to induce dread.

  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: The stillness preceding the Void's assault amplifies the suspense and underscores the gravity of the situation.
    - Cinematic calm used for maximum foreboding, not spectacle.

  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The closing scenes, juxtaposing the team's earlier disarray with their newfound unity, visually reinforce the narrative's themes of growth and redemption.
    - Cinematic closure is earned via image, not narration or exposition.

  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Action sequences, such as the team's escape from Valentina's trap, are choreographed to reflect character dynamics and escalate tension.
    - Movement and geography reflect character intent, not just plot propulsion.

  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The team's swift coordination and resource gathering are depicted through succinct montages.
    - Rhythmically cut but grounded in action that reflects emotional readiness.

  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Selective use of slow motion, particularly during critical confrontations, accentuates emotional stakes and character determination.
    - Used once, with emotional weight—never gratuitously.

  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Point-of-view shots during Bob's internal struggle provide insight into his psyche without disorienting the audience.
    - Emotional and symbolic rather than disorienting.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  21. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Void's manifestation, characterized by engulfing darkness and distorted realities, presents a unique and unsettling antagonist.
    - Horror is suggested through silence, posture, and unnatural behavior, not exaggeration.

  22. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The team's utilization of unconventional tactics and tools, such as exploiting the Void's weaknesses, showcases ingenuity and adaptability.
    - Iconic tools tied directly to the characters’ culture and available resources.

  23. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bob's confrontation with his childhood trauma within the Void symbolizes the broader theme of facing one's inner demons.
    - Symbolism arises from character arcs, not external plot contrivances.

Novocaine (Dan Berk & Robert Olsen, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Nathan as the pain-insensitive everyman turned vigilante; Sherry as the conflicted insider; Roscoe as the unlikely friend-ally.
    - Each character type begins with familiar cues but is expanded through evolving motives, emotional vulnerability, and surprise competencies.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Nathan’s quiet shame over his condition and perceived unworthiness; Sherry’s struggle with guilt and betrayal.
    - The arcs revolve around reclaiming agency through choice and confrontation, not forgiveness through plot convenience.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Nathan and Sherry’s flirtation and eventual connection develop slowly, with hesitation and mutual vulnerability.
    - Relationship beats build from insecurity, honesty, and shared trauma rather than genre-driven chemistry.

  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Roscoe, a virtual friend, becomes an unexpected support figure who risks his life for Nathan.
    - The bond grows organically from shared trust, humor, and mutual outsider status.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: The robbery is initiated without full knowledge of how Nathan will react; Sherry’s internal conflict leads to unintended consequences.
    - The inciting incident cascades outward through character flaws and secrets, not just plot triggers.

  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s quiet routines and lonely life precede the chaos of the heist and his violent awakening.
    - The stillness and banality of his world make the intrusion of violence more jarring.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s hospital recovery, reduced sentence, and final bittersweet reunion with Sherry close the arc with emotional weight.
    - The conclusion lingers in moral grayness rather than false triumph.

  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan alone and captured in Andre’s trap, facing death and the limits of his condition.
    - The lowest point is defined not just by external peril, but an internal reckoning with pain, mortality, and identity.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Simon killing the police officer and abducting Nathan in the ambulance feels like the final failure.
    - Defeat is both personal (betrayal, injury) and situational (out of options, no support).

  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The cherry pie at the end echoes Nathan and Sherry’s first date and signals a return to humanity and sensation.
    - A small, humble image replaces spectacle, encapsulating emotional resolution.

  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan, underestimated and physically impaired, ends up defeating Simon and saving Sherry.
    - His heroism is reluctant, accidental, and hard-won—rooted in persistence, not power.

  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s DIY journey from office worker to quasi-investigator includes improvised strategy and resource gathering.
    - Pacing compresses time without losing plausibility—grounded in effort and urgency.

  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan successfully kills Ben and believes he’s closing in on Sherry, only to face a worse trap and the truth of her involvement.
    - The perceived win collapses into a deeper emotional betrayal.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: The quiet, holiday-lit city and sterile credit union settings ground the early mood in detachment and routine.
    - Visual calm and emptiness support the film’s creeping tension.

  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Morning quiet at the bank before the costumed robbers enter violently.
    - Framing amplifies the contrast between domestic space and impending chaos.

  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan eating cherry pie in the final scene, mirroring the beginning of his bond with Sherry.
    - A visual symbol of emotional and sensory change—earned and quiet.

  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s pursuit of Sherry’s captors through mismatched cars and messy geography.
    - Sequences reflect inexperience and desperation, not slick polish.

  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s journey across town with help from Roscoe features clipped, urgent edits.
    - Momentum is driven by story needs and emotional stress, not music video logic.

  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The final fight uses brief slow motion sparingly to highlight impact (e.g., bone-through-jaw moment).
    - Violence is exaggerated only where catharsis is emotionally loaded.

  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV and chaotic handheld camera during torture and final confrontation with Simon.
    - Intimacy and pain are emphasized without visual incoherence.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  21. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan uses hot grease, defibrillator paddles, and handcuffs as tools during combat.
    - Improvisation is driven by necessity and character limitation, not flourish.

  22. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The cherry pie as a stand-in for recovery and connection; the defibrillator as reversal and rebirth.
    - These objects evolve thematically from mundane to meaningful through repetition.

Warner Bros. Pictures prioritized a sequel following the successful reinvention of the Batman film series with Batman Begins. Christopher and Batman Begins co-writer David S. Goyer developed the story elements, making Dent the central protagonist caught up in the battle between Batman and the Joker. In writing the screenplay, the Nolans were influenced by 1980s Batman comics and crime drama films, and sought to continue Batman Begins' heightened sense of realism. From April to November 2007, filming took place with a $185 million budget in Chicago and Hong Kong, and on sets in England. The Dark Knight was the first major motion picture to be filmed with high-resolution IMAX cameras. Christopher avoided using computer-generated imagery unless necessary, insisting on practical stunts such as flipping an 18-wheel truck and blowing up a factory.
The Dark Knight was marketed with an innovative interactive viral campaign that initially focused on countering criticism of Ledger's casting by those who believed he was a poor choice to portray the Joker. Ledger died from an accidental prescription drug overdose in January 2008, leading to widespread interest from the press and public regarding his performance. When it was released in July, The Dark Knight received acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances—particularly that of Ledger, who received many posthumous awards including Academy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actor, making The Dark Knight the first comic-book film to receive major industry awards. It broke several box-office records and became the highest-grossing 2008 film, the fourth-highest-grossing film to that time, and the highest-grossing superhero film.
Since its release, The Dark Knight has been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever, one of the best movies of the 2000s, and one of the best films ever made. It is considered the "blueprint" for many modern superhero films, particularly for its rejection of a typical comic-book movie style in favor of a crime film that features comic-book characters. Many filmmakers sought to repeat its success by emulating its gritty, realistic tone to varying degrees of success. The Dark Knight has been analyzed for its themes of terrorism and the limitations of morality and ethics. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020. A sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, concluded The Dark Knight trilogy in 2012.
Plot
A gang of masked criminals rob a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate Gotham's organized crime. Batman's true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's legitimate protector, believing Dent's success will allow him to retire as Batman and romantically pursue his childhood friend Rachel Dawes—despite her being with Dent.
Gotham's mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and Batman. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox, Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, the Joker threatens that his attacks will continue until Batman reveals his identity. He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her.
Wayne struggles to understand the Joker's motives, to which his butler Alfred Pennyworth says "some men just want to watch the world burn." Dent claims he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. Batman races to rescue Rachel while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in reverse. The explosives detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent's face on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and burns it, killing Lau in the process.
Coleman Reese, a consultant for Wayne Enterprises, deduces and tries to expose Batman's identity, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take the law into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his now half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and the mafia involved in Rachel's death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker's disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded.
Dent takes Gordon's family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel's death. He flips his coin to decide their fates, but Batman tackles him to save Gordon's son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs and the truth of his corruption will harm Gotham, Batman takes the blame for his death and actions and persuades Gordon to conceal the truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered letter from Rachel to Wayne that says she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero, and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.

Themes and analysis
Terrorism and escalation
A central theme of The Dark Knight is escalation, particularly the rise of the Joker in response to Batman's vigilantism.[310][311] Batman's vigilante operation arms him with high-tech military equipment against common criminals, and the Joker is the inevitable response and escalation of lawlessness to counter Batman. Critic Siddhant Adlakha considered the Joker an analog for countries such as Iraq, Somalia, and Lebanon, which were targeted by U.S. military campaigns and responded with escalation using terrorism.[311] Batman also inspires copycat vigilantes, further escalating lawlessness. Film studies professor Todd McGowan said Batman asserts authority over these copycats, telling them to stop because they do not have the same defensive equipment as himself, reaffirming his self-given authority to act as a vigilante.[312]
The film has been analyzed as an analog for the war on terror, the militaristic campaign the U.S. launched following the September 11 attacks.[311] The scene in which Batman stands in the ruins of a destroyed building, having failed to prevent the Joker's plot, is reminiscent of the World Trade Center site after September 11.[311] According to historian Stephen Prince, The Dark Knight is about the consequences of civil and government authorities abandoning rules in the fight against terrorism.[313] Several publications criticized The Dark Knight for a perceived endorsement of "necessary evils" such as torture and rendition.[314] Author Andrew Klavan said Batman is a stand-in for then-U.S. president George W. Bush and justified the breaching of "boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that [Batman] will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past".[312][315] Klavan's interpretation was criticized by some publications that considered The Dark Knight anti-war, proposing society must not abandon the rule of law to combat lawlessness or risk creating the conditions for escalation.[316][317] This is exemplified in the covert alliance formed between Batman, Dent, and Gordon, leading to Rachel's death and Dent's corruption.[314] Writer Benjamin Kerstein said both viewpoints are valid, and that "The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, for the first time in decades, an American mainstream no longer exists".[318]
Batman and Dent resort to torture or enhanced interrogation to stop the Joker but he remains immune to their efforts because he has a strong belief in his goals. When Dent ineffectually attempts to torture Joker's henchman, Batman does not condemn the act, only being concerned about public perception if people discover the truth. This conveys the protagonists' gradual abandonment of their principles when faced with an extreme foe.[311] The Joker meets Dent in a hospital to explain how expected atrocities, such as the deaths of several soldiers, and societal failings are tolerated but when norms are unexpectedly disrupted, people panic and descend into chaos.[311][319] Although the Joker wears disguising makeup, he is not hiding behind a mask and is the same person with or without makeup. He lacks any identity or origin, representing the uncertainty, unknowability, and fear of terrorism, although he does not follow any political ideology.[311][320] Dent represents the fulfillment of American idealism, a noble person who can work within the confines of the law and allow Batman to retire, but the fear and chaos embodied by the Joker taints that idealism and corrupts Dent absolutely.[311]
In The Dark Knight's final act, Batman employs an invasive surveillance network by co-opting the phones of Gotham's citizens to locate the Joker, violating their privacy. Adlakha described this act as a "militaristic fantasy", in which a significant violation of civil liberties is required through the means of advanced technology to capture a dangerous terrorist, reminiscent of the 2001 Patriot Act. Lucius Fox threatens to stop helping Batman in response, believing he has crossed an ethical boundary, and although Batman agrees these violations are unacceptable and destroys the technology, the film demonstrates he could not have stopped the Joker in time without it.[311][312]
Morality and ethics
The Dark Knight focuses on the moral and ethical battles faced by the central characters, and the compromises they make to defeat the Joker under extraordinary circumstances.[ay] Roger Ebert said the Joker forces impossible ethical decisions on each character to test the limits of their morality.[221][311] Batman represents order to the Joker's chaos and is brought to his own limit but avoids completely compromising himself. Dent represents goodness and hope; he is the city's "white knight" who is "pure" of intent and can operate within the law.[311][312][319] Dent is motivated to do good because he identifies himself as good, not through trauma like Batman, and has faith in the legal system.[312] Adlakha wrote Dent is framed as a religious icon, his campaign slogan being "I believe in Harvey Dent", and his eventual death leaves his arms spread wide like Jesus on the Cross.[311][319] Eckhart described Dent as someone who loves the law but feels constrained by it and his inability to do what he believes is right because the rules he must follow do not allow it.[65] Dent's desire to work outside the law is seen in his support of Batman's vigilantism to accomplish what he cannot.[41]
Dent's corruption suggests he is a proxy for those looking for hope because he is as fallible and susceptible to darkness as anyone else.[319] This can be seen in his use of a two-headed coin to make decisions involving others, eliminating the risk of chance by controlling the outcome in his favor, indicating losing is not an acceptable outcome for him. Once Dent experiences a significant traumatic event in the loss of Rachel and his own disfigurement, he quickly abandons his noble former self to seek his own form of justice. His coin is scarred on one side, introducing the risk of chance, and he submits himself to it completely. According to English professor Daniel Boscaljon, Dent is not broken; he believes in a different form of justice in a seemingly unjust world, flipping a coin because it is "Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair."[322]
The Joker represents an ideological deviancy; he does not seek personal gain and causes chaos for its own sake, setting a towering pile of cash ablaze to prove "everything burns". Unlike Batman, the Joker is the same with or without makeup, having no identity to conceal and nothing to lose.[az] Boscaljon wrote the residents and criminals believe in a form of order and rules that must be obeyed; the Joker deliberately upends this belief because he has no rules or limitations.[324] The character can be considered an example of Friedrich Nietzsche's "Superman", who exists outside definitions such as good and evil, and follows his own indomitable will. The film, however, leaves open the option to dismiss his insights because his chaos ultimately leads to death and injustice.[325] Christopher described the Joker as an unadulterated evil, and professor Charles Bellinger considered him a satanic figure who repels people from goodness and tempts them with things they supposedly lack, such as forcing Batman to choose between saving Dent—who is best for the city—and Rachel, who is best for Wayne.[326] The Joker aims to corrupt Dent to prove anyone, even symbols, can be broken. In their desperation, Dent and Batman are forced to question their own limitations. As the Joker states to Batman:
Their morals, their code ... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see—I'll show you ... when the chips are down, these civilized people ... they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster ... I'm just ahead of the curve.
— The Joker, in The Dark Knight[327]
The ferry scene can be seen as the Joker's true defeat, demonstrating he is wrong about the residents turning on each other in an extreme scenario.[311][319] According to writer David Chen, this demonstrates, individually, people cannot responsibly handle power but by sharing the responsibility, there is hope for a compassionate outcome.[319] Although Batman holds to his morals and does not kill the Joker, he is forced to break his code by pushing Dent to his death to save an innocent person. Batman chooses to become a symbol of criminality by taking the blame for Dent's crimes and preserving him as a symbol of good, maintaining the hope of Gotham's residents.[311][312][319] Critic David Crow wrote Batman's true test is not defeating the Joker but saving Dent, a task at which he fails.[328] Batman makes his own Christ-like sacrifice, taking on Dent's sins to preserve the city.[325]
Although The Dark Knight presents this as a heroic act, this "noble lie" is used to conceal and manipulate the truth for what a minority determines is the greater good.[312][329] McGowan considered the act heroic because Batman's sacrifice will leave him hunted and despised without recognition, indicating he has learned from the Joker the established norms must sometimes be broken.[312] According to professor Martin Fradley, among others, Batman's "noble lie" and Gordon's support of it is a cynical endorsement of deception and totalitarianism.[312][329] Wayne's butler Alfred also commits a noble lie, concealing Rachel's choice of Dent over Wayne to spare him the pain of her rejection.[311]

The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Bruce Wayne as the reluctant savior, Harvey Dent as the corrupted idealist, Joker as the unpredictable agent of chaos.
    - Archetypes are grounded in contradiction and evolution, defined more by moral ideology than surface traits.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Wayne’s emotional turmoil over Rachel, Dent’s internal battle with justice and revenge.
    - The characters confront inner darkness with lasting consequences, rather than tidy narrative healing.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The triangle between Bruce, Rachel, and Harvey is based on conflicted goals and unspoken regret.
    - Romantic beats are driven by philosophical conflict and deferred longing rather than genre convenience.

  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Alfred and Lucius Fox as moral and strategic anchors.
    - Both offer contrasting forms of support—Alfred through wisdom and withholding, Fox through principled boundaries.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: Batman’s presence escalates Gotham’s criminal arms race, paving the way for the Joker.
    - The story's central villain emerges from the protagonist’s actions, not coincidence.

  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Numerous moments of contemplative stillness—especially in Dent’s hospital scenes—prelude chaos.
    - These pauses amplify dread and moral unease before the next escalation.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Gotham’s citizens react in stunned quiet after the ferry scene and Dent’s death.
    - Emotional fallout is explored through consequence, not catharsis.

  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Batman confronting the surveillance state he’s created; Alfred burning Rachel’s letter.
    - These moral crises arise from internal conflict, not plot requirement.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Rachel’s death and Dent’s transformation to Two-Face mark the moral failure of the protagonists.
    - The emotional low point doubles as a political and spiritual collapse.

  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Batman fleeing into the shadows, his image redefined by Gordon’s closing monologue.
    - The conclusion echoes the film’s core question: can symbolism outweigh truth?

  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Batman must save Gotham by killing its hope (Dent’s legacy), becoming the villain.
    - Heroism is reframed as self-destruction, not applause.

  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Wayne upgrading his suit and Lucius setting up sonar tracking.
    - Preparation is mechanical and grounded, shown in precise, utilitarian beats.

  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Joker’s capture is framed as a triumph, only to result in Rachel’s death and Dent’s ruin.
    - The narrative undercuts every assumption of control, escalating stakes.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: The opening bank heist’s silent aerial descent onto Gotham skyscrapers.
    - Ominous framing replaces exposition, creating a foreboding tone without words.

  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Stillness in the interrogation room before Joker goads Batman into violence.
    - Silence becomes its own weapon in a film driven by tension and collapse.

  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Gordon’s son asking why Batman is running, echoing the film’s themes of sacrifice and public perception.
    - The visual echoes Batman’s transformation from protector to pariah.

  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Tumbler pursuit and Joker truck flip blend practical stunts with moral stakes.
    - Movement and geography reflect escalation, not spectacle for its own sake.

  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Batman equipping sonar surveillance; Gordon’s team prepping for Dent’s convoy.
    - Cutting is tight and functional, rooted in character-specific knowledge and skill.

  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Used sparingly, such as during explosions and Dent’s accident, to emphasize impact.
    - Never indulgent—timed for maximum thematic weight.

  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Minimal use, but brief subjective shots in Joker’s escape and sonar sequences reflect disorientation.
    - Employed strategically to symbolize surveillance or chaos without excess.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  21. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Harvey’s coin symbolizing control, fairness, and the illusion of justice; Joker’s scar stories as narrative misdirection.
    - Symbols and gestures evolve with character deterioration and transformation.

Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley. It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, who, with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw), hunts a man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town. Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.

Shot mostly on location at Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts from May to October 1974, Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean and consequently had a troubled production, going over budget and schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures' release of the film to over 450 screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie-in merchandise.
Regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. Jaws was followed by three sequels (none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley) and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.
Plot
In the New England beach town of Amity Island,[3][4] a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim during a beach party. An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater. Her partially eaten remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the coroner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack, Amity police chief Martin Brody closes the beaches; Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy, Alex Kintner, is killed at a crowded beach. A $3000 bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric and crusty local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming that she was killed by an unusually large shark.
When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the tiger shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes that the killer shark is still out there. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull, where he finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He accidentally drops the tooth in fright after encountering Gardner's corpse. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and nearly killing Brody's son, Michael who is hospitalized with shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint.
Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, as well as Brody's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo, and he reveals that during World War II, he survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, during which many US sailors were killed by sharks. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint speeds the Orca toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the damaged engine is overtaxed and fails.
As the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark viciously attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the ocean bottom. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody thrusts a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to shore, clinging to the remaining barrels.

"Main Title and First Victim"
Duration: 22 seconds.0:22
The main theme for Jaws, revolving around an ostinato of bass notes, which composer John Williams said were meant to represent the shark as an "unstoppable force" of "mindless and instinctive attacks"[76]
Problems playing this file? See media help.
John Williams composed the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award and was later ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute.[77][78] The main "shark" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes—variously identified as "E and F"[79] or "F and F sharp"[80]—became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger[81] (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as "grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable."[82] The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound "a little more threatening".[83] When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked "pirate music", which he called "primal, but fun and entertaining".[76] Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of Claude Debussy's La mer and of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.[80][84]
There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time.[85] Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark's heartbeat.[86] According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes Bernard Herrmann wrote for Taxi Driver, North by Northwest, and particularly Mysterious Island, it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score's strongest motif is actually "the split, the rupture"—when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie's death.[80] The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme,[82] which is exploited toward the film's climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.[85]
Spielberg later said that without Williams's score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career.[76] He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films.[82] The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album.[87][88] In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score,[87][88] and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.[89]
Themes
Influences
Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is the most notable artistic antecedent to Jaws. The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the Pequod who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the Orca, is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.[90] A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of Moby-Dick; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from Moby-Dick could not be licensed from the film's star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder.[7] Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea: "Jaws is ... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway."[25]
The underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Monster That Challenged the World.[91][92] Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: The Thing from Another World, which Gottlieb described as "a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel";[93] and It Came From Outer Space, where "the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to "concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself".[94] Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how Jaws melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the Orca, and a supernatural horror based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace.[95] Ian Freer describes Jaws as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla.[96] Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared Jaws to Godzilla;[97] and Spielberg cited Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the "masterful" way in which "it made you believe it was really happening."[98]
Critics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People.[99] Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to Jaws as "Moby-Dick meets Enemy of the People".[100] The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in Jaws by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a "deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play".[99]
Scholarly criticism
Jaws has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent Watergate scandal. He argues that Brody represents the "white male middle class—[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film", who restores public order "with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency".[101] Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine Jaws as a signal example of the film as "industrial product" that sells on the basis of "the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of Jaws is to be the most profitable movie)".[102]
Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it "a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence." He suggests that the experience of the film is "inconceivable" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.[103] In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that "individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change".[104] Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era—involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. "The Man"—the overarching conflict in Jaws does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.[105]
Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,[104] Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. "Authority must be restored", he writes, "but not by Quint". The seaman's "working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening ... irrational and out of control". Hooper, meanwhile, is "associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.[106] Britton sees the film more as concerned with the "vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them", which in turn helps generate a "pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity".[107]
Fredric Jameson's analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones ... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence."[108] He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations ... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it."[109]
Neal Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.[110]
Audience emotional response
While in theaters, the film was said to have caused a single case of cinematic neurosis in a 17-year-old, female viewer.[111] Cinematic neurosis is a condition in which viewers exhibit mental health disturbances, or a worsening of existing mental health disturbances, after viewing a film.[112] The symptoms first presented as sleep disturbances and anxiety, but one day later the patient was screaming "Sharks! Sharks!" and experiencing convulsions.[113]
This case study caused the film to become notable in the medical community alongside The Exorcist for causing stress reactions in its viewers, and was later used in a study by Brian R. Johnson to test how susceptible audiences were to cinematic stress inducers.[114] His study found that stress could be induced by cinema in segments of the general population, and Jaws specifically caused stress reactions in its viewers. While Johnson could not find an exact cause for the stress response in viewers, whether it be the suspense, the gore or the music production, a 1986 study by G. Sparks found that particularly violent films, including Jaws, tended to cause the most intense reactions in viewers.[115]
Release
Reception
Box office
Jaws opened in 409 theaters with a record $7 million weekend[144] and grossed a record $21,116,354 in its first 10 days[145] recouping its production costs.[146] It grossed $100 million in its first 59 days from 954 playdates.[147] In just 78 days, it overtook The Godfather as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office,[129] sailing past that picture's earnings of $86 million,[148] and became the first film to earn $100 million in US theatrical rentals.[149] It spent 14 consecutive weeks as the number-one film in the United States.[150] Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals.[146] Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and Summer 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.[148]
The film entered overseas release in December 1975,[151] and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore,[152] New Zealand, Japan,[153] Spain,[154] and Mexico.[155] On January 11, 1976, Jaws became the highest-grossing film worldwide with rentals of $132 million, surpassing the $131 million earned by The Godfather.[156] By the time of the third film in 1983, Variety reported that it had earned worldwide rentals of $270 million.[157] Jaws was the highest-grossing film of all time until Star Wars, which debuted two years later. Star Wars surpassed Jaws for the U.S. record six months after its release and set a new global record in 1978.[158][159]
Across all of its releases Jaws has grossed $476.5 million worldwide;[160] adjusted for inflation, it has earned almost $2 billion at 2011 prices and is the second-most successful franchise film after Star Wars.[161] Including its 2022 reissue, it has grossed $265.8 million in the United States and Canada,[160] equivalent to $1.2 billion at 2020 prices (based on an estimated 128,078,800 tickets sold),[162] making it the seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for ticket price inflation.[163] In the United Kingdom, it is the seventh-highest-grossing film to be released since 1975, earning the equivalent of over £70 million in 2009/10 currency,[164] with admissions estimated at 16.2 million.[165] Jaws has also sold 13 million tickets in Brazil, a quantity first surpassed by Titanic in 1998, and that still ranks as the sixth most attended film in the country.[166][167]
On television, ABC aired it for the first time on November 4, 1979, right after its theatrical re-release.[168] The first U.S. broadcast received a Nielsen rating of 39.1 and attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second-highest televised movie audience at the time behind Gone with the Wind and the fourth-highest rated.[169][170] In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second-biggest British TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.[171]
Critical reception
Jaws received mostly positive reviews upon release.[172][173] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars, calling it "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings. It's a film that's as frightening as The Exorcist, and yet it's a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we're being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of a brimstone-and-vomit devil."[174] Variety's A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance "absolutely magnificent".[175] According to The New Yorker's Pauline Kael, it was "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made ... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way".[176] For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark."[177] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" and complimented its acting and "extraordinary technical achievements".[178] Rex Reed praised the "nerve-frying" action scenes and concluded that "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".[179] David Thomson wrote that "like Coppola on The Godfather, Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements of a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings. The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting. You have only to submit to the travesty of Jaws 2 to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean, the perils, the sinister beauty of the shark, and the vitality of its human opponents."[180]
Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, "It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims. ... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action ... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did describe it as "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun".[181] Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. ... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written."[182] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was "often flawed by its busyness".[183] William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" and "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a "scare machine that works with computer-like precision. ... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy".[177] The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up",[183] and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature."[85] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster."[184]
Accolades
Jaws won three Academy Awards, those being for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery, and John Carter).[77][185] It was also nominated for Best Picture, losing to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.[186] Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director.[177]
Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the Grammy Award,[187] the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music,[188] and the Golden Globe Award.[189] To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.[190] The film was voted Favorite Movie at the People's Choice Awards.[191]
It was also nominated for Best Film, Director, Actor (Richard Dreyfuss), Screenplay, Editing and Sound at the 29th British Academy Film Awards,[188] and Best Motion Picture–Drama, Director and Screenplay at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards.[189] Spielberg was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for the DGA Award,[192] and the Writers Guild of America nominated Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script for Best Adapted Drama.[193]

Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Brody as the fearful but determined everyman, Hooper as the idealistic academic, Quint as the obsessive sea-hardened veteran.
    - Each character adheres to recognizable tropes but deepens into psychological realism through conflict and camaraderie.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Brody’s fear of the water and need to prove himself; Quint’s trauma from the USS Indianapolis.
    - Redemption is earned not through grand speeches but through action under pressure and moral commitment.

  3. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Quint mentors through grit and storytelling; Hooper supports via science and technical acumen.
    - These roles deepen organically through tension, failure, and eventual solidarity.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  4. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The town's decision to keep beaches open for profit leads directly to more shark attacks.
    - Capitalism and denial seed the arrival of the true threat, making the catalyst human, not supernatural.

  5. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Several quiet beach scenes, including Chrissie's swim and the stillness before the Fourth of July attack.
    - These lulls highlight the threat’s unpredictability, adding weight to each eruption.

  6. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: The town's slow acknowledgment of danger after multiple deaths, culminating in Brody’s decision to act.
    - The story lingers on civic guilt and reluctant courage rather than clean rescue beats.

  7. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: The drunken bonding scene aboard the Orca where Quint recounts the Indianapolis tragedy.
    - An emotionally raw moment that shifts tone, reframing the hunt as existential rather than just heroic.

  8. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quint's death, the destruction of the Orca, and Brody stranded on a sinking mast.
    - This is the lowest point for all three men—isolated, overmatched, and facing certain death.

  9. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Brody paddling to shore with Hooper, visually and thematically returning to land reborn.
    - The man who once feared the sea is now transformed through hardship and survival.

  10. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Brody, the least experienced of the trio, ultimately kills the shark.
    - Heroism emerges not from strength or skill but sheer will and adaptive courage.

  11. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Orca is quickly outfitted for the shark hunt, with brief glimpses of tools and weaponry.
    - These scenes are fast but motivated, grounded in each man’s skills and experience.

  12. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The tiger shark’s capture leads the town to celebrate prematurely.
    - The film undermines safety and optimism with Hooper’s grim discovery of the truth.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  13. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Chrissie’s nighttime swim opens the film in complete isolation and quiet menace.
    - The natural setting becomes weaponized through implication and negative space.

  14. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: The flat, calm beach and empty water before each major attack.
    - These shots are unbroken and observational, letting tension rise in stillness.

  15. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The concluding image of Brody and Hooper returning to shore echoes Brody’s initial discomfort with the sea.
    - Closure is visual, silent, and understated—a quiet return from chaos.

  16. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The shark dragging barrels and Orca through the water plays as a nautical pursuit.
    - Spielberg stages these moments as kinetic without overwhelming realism.

  17. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Quick sequences of baiting lines, preparing barrels, and charting their plan.
    - Pacing quickens but never loses track of character-specific intent.

  18. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Not literal slow motion, but Spielberg uses prolonged shots for tension during key attacks.
    - The action rhythmically slows via composition rather than camera trickery.

  19. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Underwater POV shots from the shark’s perspective and Brody’s point of view on the beach.
    - Subjectivity is used economically to enhance suspense, not disorient.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  20. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The repeated motif of Brody cleaning his glasses, the broken radio, the compressed air tank.
    - Symbolism is earned through repetition, escalation, and integration into the climax.

Shot mostly on location at Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts from May to October 1974, Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean and consequently had a troubled production, going over budget and schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures' release of the film to over 450 screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie-in merchandise.
Regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. Jaws was followed by three sequels (none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley) and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.
Plot
In the New England beach town of Amity Island,[3][4] a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim during a beach party. An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater. Her partially eaten remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the coroner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack, Amity police chief Martin Brody closes the beaches; Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy, Alex Kintner, is killed at a crowded beach. A $3000 bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric and crusty local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming that she was killed by an unusually large shark.
When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the tiger shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes that the killer shark is still out there. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull, where he finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He accidentally drops the tooth in fright after encountering Gardner's corpse. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and nearly killing Brody's son, Michael who is hospitalized with shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint.
Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, as well as Brody's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo, and he reveals that during World War II, he survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, during which many US sailors were killed by sharks. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint speeds the Orca toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the damaged engine is overtaxed and fails.
As the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark viciously attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the ocean bottom. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody thrusts a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to shore, clinging to the remaining barrels.

"Main Title and First Victim"
Duration: 22 seconds.0:22
The main theme for Jaws, revolving around an ostinato of bass notes, which composer John Williams said were meant to represent the shark as an "unstoppable force" of "mindless and instinctive attacks"[76]

John Williams composed the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award and was later ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute.[77][78] The main "shark" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes—variously identified as "E and F"[79] or "F and F sharp"[80]—became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger[81] (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as "grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable."[82] The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound "a little more threatening".[83] When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked "pirate music", which he called "primal, but fun and entertaining".[76] Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of Claude Debussy's La mer and of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.[80][84]
There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time.[85] Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark's heartbeat.[86] According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes Bernard Herrmann wrote for Taxi Driver, North by Northwest, and particularly Mysterious Island, it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score's strongest motif is actually "the split, the rupture"—when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie's death.[80] The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme,[82] which is exploited toward the film's climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.[85]
Spielberg later said that without Williams's score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career.[76] He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films.[82] The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album.[87][88] In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score,[87][88] and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.[89]
Themes
Influences
Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is the most notable artistic antecedent to Jaws. The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the Pequod who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the Orca, is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.[90] A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of Moby-Dick; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from Moby-Dick could not be licensed from the film's star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder.[7] Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea: "Jaws is ... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway."[25]
The underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Monster That Challenged the World.[91][92] Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: The Thing from Another World, which Gottlieb described as "a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel";[93] and It Came From Outer Space, where "the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to "concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself".[94] Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how Jaws melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the Orca, and a supernatural horror based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace.[95] Ian Freer describes Jaws as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla.[96] Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared Jaws to Godzilla;[97] and Spielberg cited Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the "masterful" way in which "it made you believe it was really happening."[98]
Critics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People.[99] Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to Jaws as "Moby-Dick meets Enemy of the People".[100] The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in Jaws by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a "deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play".[99]
Scholarly criticism
Jaws has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent Watergate scandal. He argues that Brody represents the "white male middle class—[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film", who restores public order "with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency".[101] Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine Jaws as a signal example of the film as "industrial product" that sells on the basis of "the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of Jaws is to be the most profitable movie)".[102]
Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it "a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence." He suggests that the experience of the film is "inconceivable" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.[103] In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that "individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change".[104] Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era—involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. "The Man"—the overarching conflict in Jaws does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.[105]
Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,[104] Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. "Authority must be restored", he writes, "but not by Quint". The seaman's "working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening ... irrational and out of control". Hooper, meanwhile, is "associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.[106] Britton sees the film more as concerned with the "vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them", which in turn helps generate a "pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity".[107]
Fredric Jameson's analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones ... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence."[108] He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations ... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it."[109]
Neal Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.[110]
Audience emotional response
While in theaters, the film was said to have caused a single case of cinematic neurosis in a 17-year-old, female viewer.[111] Cinematic neurosis is a condition in which viewers exhibit mental health disturbances, or a worsening of existing mental health disturbances, after viewing a film.[112] The symptoms first presented as sleep disturbances and anxiety, but one day later the patient was screaming "Sharks! Sharks!" and experiencing convulsions.[113]
This case study caused the film to become notable in the medical community alongside The Exorcist for causing stress reactions in its viewers, and was later used in a study by Brian R. Johnson to test how susceptible audiences were to cinematic stress inducers.[114] His study found that stress could be induced by cinema in segments of the general population, and Jaws specifically caused stress reactions in its viewers. While Johnson could not find an exact cause for the stress response in viewers, whether it be the suspense, the gore or the music production, a 1986 study by G. Sparks found that particularly violent films, including Jaws, tended to cause the most intense reactions in viewers.[115]
Release
Reception
Box office
Jaws opened in 409 theaters with a record $7 million weekend[144] and grossed a record $21,116,354 in its first 10 days[145] recouping its production costs.[146] It grossed $100 million in its first 59 days from 954 playdates.[147] In just 78 days, it overtook The Godfather as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office,[129] sailing past that picture's earnings of $86 million,[148] and became the first film to earn $100 million in US theatrical rentals.[149] It spent 14 consecutive weeks as the number-one film in the United States.[150] Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals.[146] Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and Summer 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.[148]
The film entered overseas release in December 1975,[151] and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore,[152] New Zealand, Japan,[153] Spain,[154] and Mexico.[155] On January 11, 1976, Jaws became the highest-grossing film worldwide with rentals of $132 million, surpassing the $131 million earned by The Godfather.[156] By the time of the third film in 1983, Variety reported that it had earned worldwide rentals of $270 million.[157] Jaws was the highest-grossing film of all time until Star Wars, which debuted two years later. Star Wars surpassed Jaws for the U.S. record six months after its release and set a new global record in 1978.[158][159]
Across all of its releases Jaws has grossed $476.5 million worldwide;[160] adjusted for inflation, it has earned almost $2 billion at 2011 prices and is the second-most successful franchise film after Star Wars.[161] Including its 2022 reissue, it has grossed $265.8 million in the United States and Canada,[160] equivalent to $1.2 billion at 2020 prices (based on an estimated 128,078,800 tickets sold),[162] making it the seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for ticket price inflation.[163] In the United Kingdom, it is the seventh-highest-grossing film to be released since 1975, earning the equivalent of over £70 million in 2009/10 currency,[164] with admissions estimated at 16.2 million.[165] Jaws has also sold 13 million tickets in Brazil, a quantity first surpassed by Titanic in 1998, and that still ranks as the sixth most attended film in the country.[166][167]
On television, ABC aired it for the first time on November 4, 1979, right after its theatrical re-release.[168] The first U.S. broadcast received a Nielsen rating of 39.1 and attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second-highest televised movie audience at the time behind Gone with the Wind and the fourth-highest rated.[169][170] In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second-biggest British TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.[171]
Critical reception
Jaws received mostly positive reviews upon release.[172][173] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars, calling it "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings. It's a film that's as frightening as The Exorcist, and yet it's a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we're being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of a brimstone-and-vomit devil."[174] Variety's A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance "absolutely magnificent".[175] According to The New Yorker's Pauline Kael, it was "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made ... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way".[176] For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark."[177] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" and complimented its acting and "extraordinary technical achievements".[178] Rex Reed praised the "nerve-frying" action scenes and concluded that "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".[179] David Thomson wrote that "like Coppola on The Godfather, Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements of a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings. The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting. You have only to submit to the travesty of Jaws 2 to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean, the perils, the sinister beauty of the shark, and the vitality of its human opponents."[180]
Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, "It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims. ... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action ... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did describe it as "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun".[181] Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. ... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written."[182] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was "often flawed by its busyness".[183] William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" and "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a "scare machine that works with computer-like precision. ... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy".[177] The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up",[183] and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature."[85] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster."[184]
Accolades
Jaws won three Academy Awards, those being for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery, and John Carter).[77][185] It was also nominated for Best Picture, losing to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.[186] Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director.[177]
Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the Grammy Award,[187] the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music,[188] and the Golden Globe Award.[189] To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.[190] The film was voted Favorite Movie at the People's Choice Awards.[191]
It was also nominated for Best Film, Director, Actor (Richard Dreyfuss), Screenplay, Editing and Sound at the 29th British Academy Film Awards,[188] and Best Motion Picture–Drama, Director and Screenplay at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards.[189] Spielberg was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for the DGA Award,[192] and the Writers Guild of America nominated Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script for Best Adapted Drama.[193]

Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Brody as the landlocked lawman, Hooper as the privileged expert, Quint as the obsessed loner.
    - Each fits a recognizable mold but reveals emotional history, flaws, and evolving dynamics over time.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Brody’s fear of water, Quint’s survivor’s guilt from the USS Indianapolis.
    - Their arcs culminate not in melodrama but in decisions of courage under pressure.

  3. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Quint provides brutal experience, Hooper offers science, and both shape Brody's transformation.
    - Their guidance is hard-earned and friction-filled, grounding their roles in ideological conflict and mutual respect.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  4. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The mayor's decision to keep the beaches open for economic gain unleashes the shark’s continued rampage.
    - Human denial and economic short-sightedness, not the supernatural, provoke catastrophe.

  5. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quiet ocean scenes before attacks—such as Chrissie's swim and the calm before the Fourth of July chaos.
    - Stillness reinforces dread without relying on music or fast cuts.

  6. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: The community's gradual reckoning with the threat, culminating in Brody's final confrontation and Hooper’s survival.
    - Survival is presented as ambiguous triumph rather than clean rescue fantasy.

  7. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quint’s monologue about the USS Indianapolis.
    - This moment deepens Quint’s character and frames the shark as more than a creature—it’s a mythic adversary.

  8. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quint’s death, the boat’s destruction, and Brody left alone with the shark.
    - Visually and structurally, it’s the moment where all hope collapses before a final reversal.

  9. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Brody and Hooper paddling to shore on barrels—contrast with Brody’s earlier land-bound discomfort.
    - A quiet bookend that signals earned survival and internal change.

  10. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Brody, the least qualified, ultimately defeats the shark.
    - His triumph is not through strength, but through resolve and ingenuity under pressure.

  11. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Outfitting the Orca before the final hunt.
    - A brisk yet character-driven sequence, grounded in practicality rather than flashy escalation.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  12. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Opening nighttime ocean shots and aerial views of Amity.
    - Sets an ominous tone using natural elements rather than overt supernatural cues.

  13. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Long, wide shots of the empty water just before an attack.
    - Uses negative space and visual restraint to amplify fear.

  14. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The quiet, steady final shot of the sea and shore.
    - Echoes the opening in tone but now contains resolution instead of ambiguity.

  15. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The shark pursuit at sea, with barrels trailing and quick boat maneuvers.
    - Chases use geography, tension, and weight instead of flashy speed.

  16. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Quick cuts of Brody, Hooper, and Quint loading the Orca.
    - Edited to reflect rising urgency while showing skill and preparation.

  17. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Minimal but present—seen in shark attacks and Brody’s final stand.
    - Used sparingly, enhancing emotion without overwhelming realism.

  18. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Underwater POV shots from the shark’s perspective.
    - Subjectivity is used for suspense but never disorients; it deepens viewer anxiety.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  19. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Brody’s use of a scuba tank as a last-ditch explosive.
    - The moment is iconic, but earned through setup and grounded in character desperation.

  20. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Quint’s scar-sharing scene and Hooper’s damaged cage represent vulnerability and fate.
    - Symbolism emerges from interaction, not decoration or forced metaphor.

Slither was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on March 31, 2006, by Universal Pictures and TVA Films respectively. It was a box office failure, grossing only $12 million worldwide against a $15 million budget, though received positive reviews from critics.
Plot
edit
A meteorite brings a malevolent, sentient extraterrestrial parasite to Earth. The parasite enters the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina, where it infects wealthy resident Grant by taking over his body and absorbing his mind. With the alien in control of him, Grant begins to transform into a grotesque, tentacled monstrosity. He also abducts and infects a local woman, Brenda, to serve as a breeder for his alien larvae. His wife Starla learns that he hasn't been to the doctor's in over a year and she becomes suspicious over the changes in his appearance and behavior, leading to Grant attacking her. When the police arrive to rescue Starla, Grant flees.
During their search for Grant, a posse led by police chief Bill Pardy discovers Brenda, whose body has become inhumanly bloated from the larvae growing inside her. The slug-like larvae burst from her body and infest everyone in town except Starla, Bill, Mayor Jack MacReady, and teenager Kylie Strutemyer. Those infected by the larvae become part of a hive mind controlled by Grant, who intends to consume all lifeforms until only his consciousness remains. However, Grant also retains his love for his wife and seeks to be reunited with her. The survivors deduce that killing Grant will eliminate the rest of the aliens before they are attacked by the infected townspeople. Bill and Kylie escape, but Starla and Jack are captured.
Armed with a grenade to kill the monster, Bill and Kylie head to Grant's home, where the infected are being absorbed by the increasingly mutated Grant. Jack and others are turned into breeders for more larvae, while Grant keeps Starla uninfected in the hope of regaining her love. After waking up, Starla arms herself with a sharp brush and goes downstairs to find Grant. She tricks him into believing she still loves him and stabs him with the brush. Grant becomes angry and throws her across the room. Bill and Kylie enter the house after shooting several alien townfolk, and euthanize an infected Jack who begs for death. Bill tries to use the grenade, only for Grant to knock it into the pool, and Grant subdues Kylie with a couch and attempts to infect Bill with his tentacles. While one of the tentacles stabs Bill in the stomach, Bill attaches the other tentacle to a propane tank. Starla shoots Grant who, filled with flammable gas, explodes, killing the rest of the aliens in the process. With everyone else in Wheelsy dead, the three survivors head off to seek help.
In a post-credits scene, a cat approaches Grant's remains and becomes infected by the alien parasite.
Cast
Themes and influences
edit
Controversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with Fred Dekker's 1986 horror-comedy Night of the Creeps. According to journalist Steve Palopoli:
When the trailer for Slither came out, Internet boards about the movie suddenly lit up with protests from a legion of fans of the 1986 film Night of the Creeps. "Alien slugs that turn people into zombies!" they cried. "What a rip-off!" I bring this up not because I think Slither— which is a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of at least a dozen '80s horror films—could really be considered a rip-off of any one of them.[3]
Palopoli then goes on to directly compare Slither to the aforementioned Creeps as well as the 1975 film Shivers. Gunn has stated that both Cronenberg's Shivers and his 1979 film The Brood were the two biggest influences on the story in Slither, along with the 2000 manga Uzumaki by Junji Ito.[4][5][6][7][8] In an interview with Jeff Schubert, Gunn also states that Slither was inspired by and pays homage to the horror-comedies from the 1980s.[9]
The film pays homage to other horror films, such as a farm being owned by Castevet in reference to the Satan-worshiping next-door neighbors in Rosemary's Baby. Jack MacReady, the mayor of Wheelsy, is named after Kurt Russell's characters Jack Burton and R.J. MacReady from the John Carpenter films Big Trouble in Little China and The Thing.

Box office

Slither was a box office flop,[14] failing to recoup its production budget[15] following its debut in the United States and Canada on March 31, 2006, in 1,945 theaters. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $3,880,270 and ranked #8 at the U.S. and Canadian box office.[14] Slither grossed $7,802,450 in its theatrical run in the United States and Canada.[16] Slither also under-performed in France, grossing $236,261 from 150 screens.[17] The film grossed $5,032,486 as of February 6, 2008 in territories outside the United States and Canada for a worldwide gross of $12,834,936.[16] Its box office performance was substantially less than its total budget of $29.5 million, including marketing costs.[14] The production budget took up about $15 million of the total.[15]
Paul Brooks, president of the film's production company, Gold Circle Films, said the company was "crushingly disappointed" by the gross.[14] Universal distanced itself from Slither's poor box office performance, citing their distribution of the film as merely part of a deal with Gold Circle.[18] The Hollywood Reporter speculated that Slither's performance "might have killed off the horror-comedy genre for the near future."[14] Producer Paul Brooks suggested that Slither failing to catch on indicated that filmgoers were no longer interested in horror-comedies.[14]
Critical response
edit
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 87% of 141 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "A slimy, B-movie homage oozing with affection for low-budget horror films, Slither is creepy and funny — if you've got the stomach for it."[19] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[20]
The movie was featured in the April 14, 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly as #1 on "The Must List"; "Ten Things We Love This Week".[21] Guest critic Michael Phillips named Slither his DVD pick of the week on the television show Ebert & Roeper.[citation needed] Slither was listed as one of the "Top 25 DVDs of the Year" by Peter Travers in Rolling Stone magazine.[22]
Among the critics who did not like the film, Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave Slither a "two thumbs down" rating on their television show, with Roeper saying he was "all zombied out" after reviewing a wave of zombie-themed films from the year before.[23]
Accolades
edit
Slither picked up the 2006 Fangoria "Chainsaw Award" for Highest Body Count and garnered nominations in the categories Relationship From Hell, Dude You Don't Wanna Mess With, and Looks That Kill.[24] Additionally, the horror magazine Rue Morgue named Slither the "Best Feature Film of the Year".[25]

Slither (James Gunn, 2006) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Bill as the reluctant sheriff, Starla as the conflicted spouse, Grant as the grotesque tragic monster.
    - Each starts with familiar traits but subverts or deepens those roles with humor, trauma, and desire.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Grant’s lingering humanity despite being host to the alien hive, Bill's leadership under pressure.
    - Redemption arises not through heroism, but by resisting despair and choosing others over self.

  3. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Kylie serves as an unexpected moral compass and source of intel; Jack adds both comic relief and cynical foil.
    - Each supporting figure enriches the main arc and expands the world’s psychological landscape.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  4. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The meteorite's arrival and Grant’s infection open the door to annihilation.
    - The alien menace escalates organically from human vulnerability and curiosity.

  5. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quiet domestic moments—Grant watching Starla sleep or Starla walking through their home—precede carnage.
    - Calm is used to magnify terror, not relax the viewer.

  6. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: The town is devastated, but the survivors walk into dawn—not triumph, but endurance.
    - The ending evokes survival through loss rather than Hollywood catharsis.

  7. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Starla confronting the remnants of her husband inside the monster.
    - A metaphorical and literal reckoning with what has been lost and what remains worth saving.

  8. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Starla and Jack are captured; Bill’s grenade fails; Kylie is pinned—chaos overtakes all plans.
    - The emotional low point where survival seems hopeless.

  9. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The trio walking away as the only survivors recalls the intimacy of earlier group scenes, now fractured.
    - It reflects thematic loss while visually reinforcing survival.

  10. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bill, not the alpha or action archetype, ultimately kills the monster through luck and resolve.
    - The ordinary man’s resourcefulness trumps the trope of physical domination.

  11. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The discovery of Brenda seems to offer clarity, but it’s a trap that spreads infection.
    - Hope turns into escalation, not relief.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  12. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Opening shots of Wheelsy and the meteorite’s crash set a foreboding but ironic tone.
    - Foreshadows the invasion with slow-burn dread and B-movie homage.

  13. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Still frames of townspeople mid-infection contrast with the chaos to follow.
    - Uses stillness to tease horror lurking beneath the familiar.

  14. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The three survivors leaving town echoes their earlier, mundane small-town lives—now altered forever.
    - A visual epilogue of loss and unlikely kinship.

  15. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bill and Kylie fleeing infected townsfolk through suburban streets and alien-infested homes.
    - Geography and movement build suspense rather than spectacle.

  16. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Weapon gathering and town defense sequences before the final showdown.
    - Chaotic, comedic, and pragmatic—reflecting genre tone.

  17. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The explosion of Grant is stylized but brief.
    - Used for grotesque effect, never lingering for glamor.

  18. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV slug-cam sequences simulate infection and disorientation.
    - Adds narrative clarity through horror perspective without excessive chaos.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  19. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The parasitic slug design and Grant’s grotesque mutation mix horror, humor, and body horror tradition.
    - Taps into primal disgust while innovating visually.

  20. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Propane tanks, brushes, and ad hoc gear used in life-or-death scenarios.
    - Desperation fuels creativity, with real-world logic intact.

  21. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Grant sparing Starla out of love even in monstrous form.
    - Symbolizes the tragic persistence of human memory within corruption.

Plot
edit
On Guy Fawkes Night, trainee nurse Samantha Adams is mugged by a gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest, Dennis, Jerome, Biggz and leader Moses. When a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a dog-sized alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron and his boss Hi-Hatz, a local gang leader, who instead recruits Moses to work for him.
More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site, where they find one dead alien, but other living aliens. However, they find these aliens are much larger and more threatening. After one kills Dennis's pet pitbull Pogo, the gang flee but are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives it away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car when they pass through a nearby building's parking space. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman, who accuse Moses of trying to kill Hi-Hatz in order to replace him as the local drug lord. An alien arrives and kills the henchman but is killed in turn by Hi-Hatz.
The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, a tower block, but are attacked outside by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin, though he is later saved by a pair of their young neighbours who manage to kill the alien. Meanwhile, Pest is bitten in the leg by an alien who breaks into their building. They discover that Samantha also lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts into her flat and Moses kills it with a samurai sword. Realising that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them.
The gang move upstairs to the flat where Tia, Dimples, Dionna and Gloria live, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. Two aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and decapitating Dennis. Samantha kills an alien, saving Moses in the process, while Tia and Dimples manage to kill the other one by ganging up on it. The girls believe the boys to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen arrive and attack the gang, blaming them for the death of the first henchman, but another alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift; only Hi-Hatz makes it out alive.
Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang run into more aliens, but use fireworks as a distraction and manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find Hi-Hatz waiting, who prepares to shoot Moses but he is then suddenly attacked and killed by the rest of the aliens who break in through the window. The group flee and are joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a zoology student. Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.
In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a habitable planet; after landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong pheromone to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species; Moses has been carrying scent since he killed the female, which is how the males have always been able to find them. Moses persuades Pest to return Samantha's stolen ring and together they form a plan. As Samantha has not been stained with the alien pheromone she can to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.
Samantha successfully bypasses the aliens and turns on the gas in the flat. She leaves the tower block, and Moses, with the corpse of the small female alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas-filled flat with all of the big male aliens following him. He throws the corpse into the flat; with a firework he ignites the room and leaps out of the window. The resulting explosion kills all the aliens but leaves the high-rise flat in flames. Moses survives by grabbing onto a flag hanging from the balcony.
In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis and Ron are arrested and held responsible by the arriving police for all of the recent deaths around the block that night. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers who had arrested Moses earlier. Instead, Samantha says the boys are her neighbours and they protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses; they both smile.
Cast
edit
Representative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast (many of whom spoke Multicultural London English during the film) were young, relative unknowns and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.[6] John Boyega found out about this film from an advert placed on the internet. The cast includes:
John Boyega as Moses, a low-level crook, teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.
Jodie Whittaker as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower.
Alex Esmail as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and loyal second-in-command of Moses's gang.
Franz Drameh as Dennis, a hotheaded pizza delivery boy and the enforcer of the gang.
Leeon Jones as Jerome, the most level-headed member of the gang and the most academically inclined.
Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a recycling bin after he is cornered by the aliens.
Nick Frost as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of Wyndham Tower and knows everyone.
Luke Treadaway as Brewis, a posh student stoner who is one of Ron's customers.
Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, the local psychopathic gangster who is Ron's feared boss.
Danielle Vitalis as Tia, a girl living in Wyndham Tower who is Moses's love interest and friend to the gang.
Paige Meade as Dimples, Tia's quick tempered roommate who is also a friend to the gang.
Sammy Williams as Probs, a child who wishes to join Moses's gang.
Michael Ajao as Mayhem, Probs's best friend, who shares his goal of joining Moses's gang.
Jacey Sallés as Biggz's mum.
Karl Collins as Dennis' dad.
Joey Ansah as Policeman.
Chris Wilson as arresting Police Officer.
Production
edit
Big Talk Pictures, known for films including Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, produced the film alongside Film4, The UK Film Council and StudioCanal.[2]
The plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. The director wanted to counter the trend of 'hoodie horror' films which demonised urban youths.[7] Cornish also based the character of the stoner Brewis on himself in his twenties.
Filming
edit
Attack the Block is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the Stockwell district of London. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:
We wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early on, and since we couldn't show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.[8]
The name Wyndham Tower appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional tower block, referencing the English science-fiction writer John Wyndham, author of the 1953 novel, 'The Kraken Wakes' , which similarly begins with aliens invading Earth from outer space, as well as other science-fiction monster works such as 'Day of the Triffids'. Other buildings in the estate are named for J. G. Ballard, author of a number of novels set in large urban tower blocks, including High-Rise where mayhem breaks out in a high-rise London apartment block, and famous science fiction authors H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley and Douglas Adams.
The film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots[9] on the Heygate Estate in Elephant and Castle; Myatts Field, Brixton; Oval Underground station and the Bemerton Estate in Islington. Interior scenes were filmed at Three Mills Studios in Newham, part of the East End of London.[10]
Creature effects
edit
The creatures began with two men in gorilla-like suits with animatronic jaws; post-production added the unearthly qualities such as the spiky fur which doesn't reflect any light, the claws, the rows of bioluminescent jaws, and even some of their movement. In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house Fido.[11] The creatures have no eyes, navigating their environments by echolocation and using a highly developed sense of smell to hunt and find mates. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of dolphin sonar mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.[12] Some puppets were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast. In 2023, Cornish stated the creature designs were partly based on his pet cat who "engulfs darkness".
Release
Reception
edit
Box office
edit
On its opening theatrical weekend in the United Kingdom in May 2011, Attack the Block garnered £1,133,859, putting it in third place only slightly behind American blockbusters Thor and Fast Five; also in the opening weekend Attack the Block had the highest cinema site average by almost twice of the other films.[18] On a screen-by-screen basis, Attack the Block was the week's strongest performer.[19] In North America, the film's theatrical run began in July 2011 and was a box office flop[20] despite receiving overall good reviews. Its theatrical run began in July 2011 and, in limited release for less than two months with 66 cinemas at its peak, it managed to gross US$1,024,175 in North America.[3]
Critical response
edit
Attack the Block received acclaim from critics. Review aggregation Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on 183 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Effortlessly mixing scares, laughs, and social commentary, Attack the Block is a thrilling, briskly-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor."[21] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[22]
The website Slash film lists Attack the Block as a "true cult classic" deserving of its own action figures.[23] In his review, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert praised the film's use of character development and the performance given by Boyega.[24] Scott Wampler of The Examiner rated it A+ and said it was officially the best film of the 2011 film festival season and likened it to other debuts such as Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.[25] Matt Patches writing for Cinemablend said "Attack the Block, even on its small scale, may wind up as one of the best action movies of the year".[26] Christ Tilly at IGN gave it four stars saying "Cornish directs with the confidence of a seasoned pro" and calling the film "a blast from start-to-finish."[27] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy awarded the movie four stars, saying that it is "exactly the kind of distinctly homegrown product that the British film industry should be making".[28] Mark Kermode gave a mixed review saying he did not dislike the film, but "wanted it to be funnier" and "needed it to be scarier".[29]
Attack the Block was revisited by critics following the casting of its two lead actors as stars of flagship science fiction franchises – Boyega as Finn in Star Wars and Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor in Doctor Who. In a 2017 retrospective, Tom Philip writing for GQ described the film as "one of the most confidently-delivered debut feature films in recent memory" and said it "still stands out as one of the best genre-mashup films of the decade",[30] while Nathan Rabin for Rotten Tomatoes said that the film deserved cult status and called it "a star-making vehicle in the truest sense".[31] It was listed among Wired Magazine's best films of the 2010s.[32]

Attack the Block (Joe Cornish, 2011) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Moses as a teenage gang leader with depth, Samantha as a cautious nurse forced into alliance, Brewis as the unlikely academic.
    - Archetypes are subverted through moral transformation, empathy, and generational exchange.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses grapples with guilt and societal judgment, ultimately risking his life to save his block.
    - His arc moves from alienation to heroic responsibility, reframing urban youth as potential protectors.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Hints of romantic interest between Moses and Tia, restrained and quietly respectful.
    - Never prioritized above survival or character growth, avoiding genre shortcuts.

  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ron, the laid-back drug dealer, and Brewis, the clumsy stoner/zoologist, both offer insight and assistance.
    - Their value lies in surprising competence and emotional loyalty.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The gang’s killing of the first alien triggers the invasion by attracting the males via pheromones.
    - Violence backfires, rooted in misunderstanding, not malice.

  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Interludes of quiet—kids walking home, characters hiding—precede sudden violence.
    - Used for tension rather than cheap jumps.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses survives the explosion, arrested but hailed as a hero by the neighborhood.
    - A grounded resolution that blends realism with redemption.

  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses learning his actions brought danger, deciding to sacrifice himself for the block.
    - The emotional low point reorients him from survival to self-sacrifice.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Most of the gang is dead, the aliens overwhelm every safe space, and Moses prepares to die.
    - Reflects not just physical danger, but emotional isolation.

  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The cheering block bookends Moses’s introduction, now recast through admiration rather than fear.
    - Reflects earned identity transformation.

  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Moses, the marginalized protagonist, saves the block alone by drawing all the creatures to himself.
    - Heroism emerges from circumstance and conviction, not design.

  12. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Temporary safety in the girls’ flat quickly unravels with Dennis’s death.
    - Illusions of safety collapse under relentless escalation.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  13. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Tower block exteriors lit by fireworks create foreboding with urban authenticity.
    - Grounded visual tone replaces stylized menace.

  14. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Stillness during stealth scenes contrasts with frenzied attacks.
    - Builds rhythm and anticipation.

  15. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses in handcuffs, framed as a hero through crowd chants and a proud smile.
    - Cinematic punctuation of internal transformation.

  16. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The gang sprinting through the estate’s stairwells and alleys.
    - Geography reflects territory and stakes.

  17. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Weapon-gathering scenes use tight edits and tension-building cuts.
    - Kinetic but thematically driven by desperation.

  18. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV shots during alien chases through smoke and darkness.
    - Enhances immersion without sacrificing clarity.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  19. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bioluminescent jaws, eyeless black fur, and echolocation-based tracking.
    - Design combines menace with minimalism, avoiding cliché humanoid features.

  20. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fireworks, baseball bats, and machetes are repurposed with DIY strategy.
    - Emphasizes ingenuity over brute force.

  21. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Moses running with the female alien’s corpse as bait.
    - Becomes a metaphor for guilt, responsibility, and earned adulthood.

Plot
edit
Matthew "Matt" King is a Honolulu-based attorney and the sole trustee of a family trust of 25,000 acres (100 km2) of pristine land on Kauai. The land has great monetary value, but is also a family legacy. While Matt has ably managed his own finances (as his father did), most of his cousins have squandered their inheritances. With the trust expiring in seven years due to the rule against perpetuities, the King clan is pressuring Matt to sell the land for hundreds of millions of dollars. Amidst these discussions, a boating accident has rendered Matt's wife, Elizabeth, comatose. With Elizabeth hospitalized, Matt is forced to cope with his two troubled daughters, 10-year-old Scottie, who seeks attention by bullying other children, and 17-year-old Alex, who has a history of substance abuse and is away at a private boarding school on the Big Island. Elizabeth's coma is determined irreversible and her living will directs all life support be discontinued. When Matt tells Alex, she reveals that Elizabeth was having an affair, which had caused a major rift between mother and daughter.
Close family friends, Kai and Mark Mitchell, tell Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy and loved Brian Speer, a real estate agent. She also wanted a divorce. After Matt informs friends about Elizabeth's condition so they can say goodbye, he decides Brian should have an opportunity to do the same. He and the girls, along with Alex's slacker friend Sid, travel to Kauai to find Brian. While there, Matt's cousin, Hugh, mentions that Brian is brother-in-law to Don Hollitzer, the developer to whom the majority of the family wants to sell the land. Brian stands to make a small fortune from sales commissions for the properties that will be developed on the land. Matt and his daughters find Brian vacationing with his family at an oceanside cabin. Matt privately confronts Brian and informs him Elizabeth is dying, and offers him an opportunity to say goodbye. Matt asks Brian if Elizabeth loved him, and he says she did, but he only considered her a fling and still loves his wife and children. Brian then apologizes to Matt for the pain he caused and asks he not tell his wife.
Frustrated and fragile from recent events, Matt asks the doctor to explain Elizabeth's inevitable death to Scottie. Elizabeth's father, Scott, admonishes Matt for failing to be a more generous and loving husband. Withholding his wife's affair, Matt agrees with him, but Sid and Alex unexpectedly defend Matt. At the King family meeting, Matt overrules the majority vote of his cousins, preferring to keep the land and find a way around the rule against perpetuities. Shocked, Hugh warns Matt that the family will take legal action, but Matt is undeterred.
After learning about Brian's affair, his wife, Julie, comes to the hospital. She tearfully tells a comatose Elizabeth that she wants to hate her for "trying to destroy" her family, but that she has to forgive her for her own peace of mind. Matt comes to terms with his wife's infidelity and impending death. He kisses her goodbye, followed by Alex and Scottie. After she dies, they scatter Elizabeth's ashes in the ocean off Waikiki.
Later, Matt, Scottie and Alex eat ice cream and watch March of the Penguins, covering themselves in a blanket that Elizabeth had at the hospital.

The Descendants (Alexander Payne, 2011) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Matt King as a passive land baron forced into active moral decision-making, Alex as a rebellious teen with hidden empathy, Sid as a slacker masking deeper emotional intelligence.
    - Characters avoid oversimplification by evolving through grief, confrontation, and layered relational shifts.

  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt's journey from emotional detachment to active parenting and moral leadership.
    - Redemption is earned through exposure to betrayal, familial collapse, and existential uncertainty.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Example: No new romance is forced into the narrative, but Matt's re-examination of love post-infidelity serves as a subtle reawakening.
    - The emotional space left by Elizabeth’s coma is respected rather than filled.

  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Characters like Julie Speer and Scott Thorson act as emotional mirrors and boundary enforcers for Matt.
    - These figures add moral complexity without providing easy answers.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The boating accident and Elizabeth’s coma catalyze Matt’s unraveling family structure and inheritance dilemma.
    - The inciting trauma is mundane but life-altering, driving internal and external conflict.

  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Long, quiet scenes on hospital grounds, beaches, and in cars precede revelations and emotional collapse.
    - Used to accentuate interiority rather than tension.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt and his daughters eat ice cream post-funeral, silently recovering together under a hospital blanket.
    - The healing is modest, symbolic, and believable.

  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt quietly watching his comatose wife while learning the affair was real and that she wanted a divorce.
    - The emotional climax is inward, not performative.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt must tell Scottie the truth about her mother and face the looming familial vote on the land.
    - He appears cornered both emotionally and ethically.

  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The family huddled under the same hospital blanket watching TV mirrors earlier scenes of disconnected cohabitation.
    - Signals earned intimacy and unspoken reconciliation.

  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt goes against the financial interests of his extended family to preserve the land’s legacy.
    - His heroism is moral and civic, not physical or confrontational.

  12. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Finding and confronting Brian Speer feels like catharsis, but changes nothing about Elizabeth’s condition.
    - Emotional relief is replaced by moral ambiguity and further grief.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  13. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Aerial shots of untouched Hawaiian landscape reflect both paradise and impending erosion—literal and emotional.
    - Natural imagery functions as both setting and metaphor.

  14. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quiet walks through hospital corridors or lingering wide shots before a revelation.
    - Allows emotional tension to build through space, not sound.

  15. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ice cream on the couch with Elizabeth’s hospital blanket bookends the arc of familial alienation.
    - Closure is achieved without dialogue.

  16. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Occasional use of soft-focus or long lens to reflect Matt’s growing detachment or realization.
    - Minimalist and selective, not melodramatic.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  17. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scattering Elizabeth’s ashes into the ocean off Waikiki signifies both cultural rootedness and emotional release.
    - Symbolism is emotionally grounded, not abstract or manipulative.

  18. Family Legacy and Responsibility Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The contested inheritance of the Kauai land serves as a metaphor for stewardship, identity, and values.
    - Tropes of generational wealth are interrogated through ethical rather than dramatic conflict.

  19. Secret Affair Discovered Post-Trauma (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Alex’s reveal of Elizabeth’s affair complicates Matt’s grief and propels the film’s second act.
    - A common device, but handled with restraint and psychological complexity.

Williamson, who was struggling to get his projects off the ground, was inspired by reports of a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper as he wrote a screenplay that satirized the clichés of the slasher genre popularized in films such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Developed under the title Scary Movie, Williamson's script became the subject of an intense bidding war from multiple studios before Miramax Films purchased the rights. Craven, despite turning down the opportunity multiple times, agreed to direct the film after he had read the script as he was determined to re-establish himself after several career setbacks. The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio. Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of $15 million. Craven trimmed down the violence in the film after being involved in a tense conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) over the desired R-rating.
Released on December 20, Scream was not expected to perform well due to concerns over releasing a slasher film in a time normally reserved for holiday entertainment. However, it went on to gross approximately $173 million worldwide through the strength of word of mouth, becoming a surprise success and one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Contemporary reviews were positive, with praise going to the performances of its cast and its unique meta humor, but criticism was directed at its excessive violence and lack of suspense in favor of that humor. Scream revitalized both Craven's and Barrymore's careers and helped bolster the careers of its young cast.
In the years since its release, Scream's reception has been positive. It has been credited with rekindling interest in the horror genre during the 1990s following a decline in the genre's popularity and has been credited for shifting the genre towards younger audiences and casting established actors. The film's opening sequence, in which Barrymore's character is killed by Ghostface, is considered one of the most shocking and subversive in cinematic history. The success of the film launched a multimedia franchise, which comprises the sequels Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000), Scream 4 (2011), Scream (2022), Scream VI (2023), and Scream 7 (2026), as well as an anthology television series.
Plot
edit
In the small town of Woodsboro, California, high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person. They discuss horror films until the caller turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steve, is tied up on her patio. The caller demands she answer questions about horror films to save his life, but Casey gives an incorrect answer about Friday the 13th, resulting in Steve's death. Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a "Ghostface" costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents.
The next morning, the news media descend on the town as a police investigation ensues. Casey's classmate, Sidney Prescott, struggles with the impending first anniversary of the rape and murder of her mother Maureen by Cotton Weary. The trauma has made her unable to consummate her relationship with her boyfriend, Billy Loomis. As her father Neil is traveling for work, Sidney waits at home alone for her best friend, Tatum Riley. She receives a call taunting her about Maureen's death and is attacked by Ghostface, who disappears just before Billy climbs through her window. Sidney immediately grows suspicious when he drops a cell phone, and Billy is arrested by Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley, Tatum's brother. Outside the police station, Sidney gets into a physical altercation with investigative journalist Gale Weathers. Gale had written a book claiming that Maureen had multiple extramarital affairs, including one with Cotton, whom Gale believes was falsely accused of Maureen's homicide. Sidney stays at Tatum's home but receives another taunting call from the killer. The calls are traced to Neil's phone, but the police are unable to locate him.
Following his release, Billy encounters Sidney at school and further upsets her by comparing his absent mother to Maureen's death. After suspending classes in the wake of the murders, Principal Himbry is killed in his office. To celebrate the school's closure, Stu Macher, Tatum's boyfriend, hosts a party at his secluded home. Dewey and Gale keep watch on the party in case the killer strikes again. Tatum is isolated in the garage by Ghostface, who crushes her neck in the garage door. As fellow high schooler Randy Meeks details the rules of surviving a horror film, news arrives of Himbry's murder. Most partygoers leave to see his body, nearly running over Dewey and Gale while inadvertently leading them to Neil's hidden car. Billy arrives at the house to reconcile with Sidney, and they finally have sex. Afterward, they are attacked by Ghostface, and Billy is stabbed. Sidney evades Ghostface, who kills Gale's cameraman Kenny and stabs Dewey when he returns. Gale, attempting to flee in her van, crashes and is knocked unconscious. Sidney seeks refuge inside the house, locking Stu and Randy outside as they accuse each other of being the killer.
A seemingly wounded Billy emerges and allows Randy inside before shooting him in the shoulder, revealing himself as the killer and Stu as his accomplice. Billy confesses they killed Maureen because the discovery of her affair with his father led to his mother's abandonment. The pair abducted Neil to frame him for their crimes and proceed to stab each other to depict themselves as the last survivors. However, they are distracted by Gale's return, allowing Sidney to incapacitate Billy and kill Stu by dropping a television set on his head. Billy nearly stabs Sidney but is shot by Gale. After Randy remarks that horror film killers revive for a final scare, Billy lunges for them, but Sidney shoots him in the head, killing him. As dawn breaks, Neil is rescued, Dewey is taken away by ambulance, and Gale provides an impromptu news report about the night's events.

Writing

Screenwriter Kevin Williamson (pictured in 2012)
In 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs. Tingle (1999).[a] While house-sitting, Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled. Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support. The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.[26][28] The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream. He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl.[24][26][28]
Williamson spent the next three days writing a script for a slasher film he called Scary Movie while listening to the score to Halloween (1978) for further inspiration.[b] He also drafted two five-page outlines for possible sequels.[28][30] He developed much of the script around a single line of dialogue, "movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative". This was his response to contemporary concerns about the influence of cinematic violence on audience, and he "thought it was a great line".[25] Williamson's script drew upon many of his favorite horror films, such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Prom Night (both 1980), and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).[29] At the time, the successful slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s had fallen out of favor, in part because of increasingly poorly received sequels to long-running horror franchises.[31][26][27]
His characters were intentionally designed to be knowledgeable about these horror films and their typical elements, with the intention of creating a unique killer who was not only aware of horror film clichés but also exploited them for his own advantage. Williamson expressed his approach, "I thought if you could expose the rules and play with them, then the audience doesn't know what they're going to get. Suddenly they're on edge. I started playing with the tropes, and the 'rules' were part of that."[27][26] The opening scene depicting Casey Becker's death emulates that of Janet Leigh's character in Psycho (1960) by killing off a possible main character early on. Williamson believed it would hook studio executives and leave audiences unsure how the plot would progress.[26] Williamson set the script in his hometown of Bayboro, North Carolina, believing its quiet atmosphere would provide a strong contrast with a serial killer's actions.[32]
Williamson pursued Scary Movie because it was the type of horror film he enjoyed as a child but believed were no longer being made.[33][26][34] Even so, he did not believe studios would develop and intended to use it to garner attention and secure other work.[25] Williamson's agent had him scale back the gore, removing descriptions such as "the insides are slowly rolling down her leg", because it would make it difficult to sell the script. Williamson refused to cut any dialogue, however, believing it set it apart from similar films.[29][28]
Development
edit
 
Director Wes Craven (pictured in 2010)
By 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to Scary Movie, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone.[c] The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films. She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films' genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films.[35] Potter expected a "stupid spoof" but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights.[25][26][36] He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others.[37] Although others offered larger figures, Williamson's lawyer advised him take Weinstein's offer ($400,000–$500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately.[d]
Williamson revised the script based on studio input, removing some gorier content (such as exposed internal organs and severed limbs) and adding the murder of principal Himbry because Weinstein said there was too long a period following the opening without any deaths. This solved a separate difficulty Williamson was having explaining why all but the core group of characters leave Stu's party in the finale, as they go to see Himbry's corpse.[38][28][39] The Scary Movie title was also changed to Scream late in production because Weinstein was concerned Scary Movie would lead audiences to believe it was a comedy instead of a horror.[e]
The search for a director was protracted, with Danny Boyle,[33][28] Tom McLoughlin,[42] Sam Raimi,[28] George A. Romero,[42] Bryan Singer,[43] Quentin Tarantino,[26] Robert Rodriguez,[26][33] and Anthony Waller[44] being considered. No agreements were secured because those approached for the role interpreted the script as a comedy instead of a horror satire.[f] Wes Craven was discounted by the studio due to his lack of experience directing satires.[43][33] Craven liked the script but he wanted to work on less gory and more mainstream content (including a film adaptation of the 1959 horror novel The Haunting of Hill House) because of the negative public perception of him based on his previous films.[g]
Craven's assistant Julie Plec and producer Marianne Maddalena continued to push Scream to Craven.[25][26][48] His interest was renewed after The Haunting of Hill House adaptation was cancelled and he experienced the personal disappointment of his failed horror comedy, Vampire in Brooklyn (1995).[26][44][49] After reading the script, Plec said Craven suggested the studio "'make him an offer he can't refuse.' And so Dimension did. And he took it."[26][25] The deal also offered Craven his choice of other projects to direct after Scream.[36]
Williamson met Craven to discuss the script, believing he would request substantial rewrites, but Craven's notes related mainly to typos and some minor additions including restoring some of the gorier content and refining the ending which was not yet fully realized.[h] Williamson said "The story stayed pretty much intact, but we added some scares, and shortened it. Wes reworked some of the action sequences, and we would argue and go back and forth, but there's a point where I had to realize that Wes is more experienced than I am."[50] Describing the script Craven said, "what it forces you to do is sort of look at the reality of things we typically look at as amusing, like the Friday the 13th type of deaths where people have arrows through their heads and kids scream and laugh. But that suddenly starts happening in their actual lives."[51]
Casting
edit
 
 
Rose McGowan (pictured in 2007) and Jamie Kennedy (2010)
Atypical for the genre at the time, Scream featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors.[25][26] Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore's agent to cast her in the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she later requested the smaller role of Casey Becker.[i] Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey.[54] The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during Scream's opening and convince audiences that no character was safe.[25][55][26] Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott. Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast, and Williamson's choice, Molly Ringwald, believed she was too old for the part.[28][54] The final choices came down to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Neve Campbell.[26][31][25] According to Williamson, Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and, to improve her chances, they filmed her screen-test first, forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance.[25] Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability.[26] Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was "a fantastic character for any kind of movie" who transitions from "tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong".[56]
Woods suggested Courteney Cox for the cold and calculating Gale Weathers, believing it would be interesting to play against her typical personable characters in series such as Family Ties (1982–1989) and Friends (1994–2004). Craven did not believe Cox could play the part and so she wrote a letter assuring him that "being 'a bitch' wouldn't be a stretch at all".[26][25] Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo were considered but a more established actress was preferred.[21] David Arquette auditioned for unspecified younger characters, but he was attracted to the role of Dewey and acting against Cox. The character was written as a "dumb jock" but Arquette interpreted it as a "position of authority getting no respect ... He wants to be John Wayne ... He wants to be this tough guy, but he's just got a heart of gold."[26][25] Rose McGowan's agent jeopardized her chance to play Tatum by insisting on a payment of $250,000 instead of the offered $50,000, which was lower than the $100,000 received by some other principal actors. As a result, McGowan had to reaudition for the role twice.[57][9] McGowan influenced Tatum's design, dying her hair blonde to avoid having two dark-haired main female characters,[9] removing an Indigo Girls poster from Tatum's bedroom (because she would not listen to the relatively older band), and rejecting costuming suggestions in favor of her self-bought outfits.[58] Thora Birch and Natasha Lyonne also auditioned for the role; Lyonne was the preferred choice but, as she was under 18, could not consent to joining without parental permission.[57]
Believing he was rising in popularity, Vince Vaughn was the studio's preferred choice for Billy Loomis, but he was too ill to audition.[20] Skeet Ulrich did not attend auditions because of scheduling conflicts but his girlfriend did and mentioned Ulrich brought her; Beach went out to meet him personally.[20] Ulrich liked playing a serial killer after more innocent and naive previous roles.[25][59] To develop his character, Ulrich researched serial murders, psychological profiles, and outfitted one of his hotel rooms to the Billy persona to help him get into character, outfitting it with punk rock posters and blacklights. He said, "I was into punk music in my teens and really just trying to recapture that angst ... I would sit in there and read about serial killers and watch Faces of Death (1978) ... anything to get into that gory mindset."[59][60] Ulrich and Campbell starred together in The Craft (1996), which they believed fostered a natural relationship between their characters.[61] Matthew Lillard auditioned for Billy, but the casting directors did not consider him the right actor to "make out with [Campbell]" and had him audition as Stu for Craven, who immediately offered him the part.[27][25][26]
Seth Green, Jason Lee, and Breckin Meyer were all preferred for Randy, the "lanky, gangly, opinionated fifth wheel, who really has a love and passion for movies", but Craven and Williamson appreciated the innocence and comedy that Jamie Kennedy brought to his portrayal. Kennedy credited Craven for supporting his casting.[25][27][62] W. Earl Brown and Craven were friends and he was not required to audition but did have to gain about 20 lb (9.1 kg); he originally wanted to portray Dewey.[25][19] Roger L. Jackson was hired based on his voice work for Mars Attacks! (1996).[17][26] He recounted overhearing his competitors discussing the Ghostface as the "new Freddy Krueger", but Jackson interpreted it as a more subtle role which required charisma and sexiness to keep his target on the phone even though they want to hang up.[26][25] Barrymore wanted someone to act against in her scene instead of the character's lines being read to her, and while the filmmakers intended to dub over Jackson's voice with Tom Kane, Craven liked his performance.[17][25][63] Henry Winkler shared an agent with Craven and made his cameo appearance as a favor.[64] Lynn McCree, Sidney's mother, was a Sonoma local; she spent two hours taking pictures with Campbell for the role but had no knowledge of the character's backstory.[19] Liev Schreiber took the part of Cotton Weary for $20,000 during an unrelated meeting with Bob Weinstein.[25][65] Extras were drawn from locals including the owners of a restaurant frequented by the cast and crew.[66]
Pre-production

An isolated home in Tomales, California served as the location of Scream's finale.
It was determined early on that Scream required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets. Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties.[67] Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility.[68] Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations: "I wanted to have very American looking houses ... and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn't look attractive to me."[68][32] Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California.[68][32]
Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, California offered most features the filmmakers required, but the Weinsteins rejected the additional $1 to 2 million required to film there until the filmmakers convinced them that Craven's name would attract enough audiences to compensate for the added cost.[j] The opening scene used a house in Glen Ellen.[26][70] Miller said, "We didn't want homes that looked like castles, or that you could really protect yourself in ... so if somebody was going to be stalking them, they could get to them very quickly."[71] Other Santa Rosa locations used in Scream include Sidney's House at 1820 Calistoga Road, interiors of Tatum's house at 824 McDonald Avenue, and the Bradley Video store, where Randy works.[72][70][73] The Healdsburg, California town square appears as the location of the Woodsboro Town Square, the fountain, and the exterior of the town police station.[70][72][74]
Stu's home was an unoccupied property in Tomales which offered a dark and isolated atmosphere for the finale.[27][75][76] Cinematographer Mark Irwin unsuccessfully argued against using the property because it was on top of a hill, introducing logistical challenges for accessing trailers and equipment.[77] Miller built a facade of barns in front of the house so trailers could be sited closer while remaining concealed.[78] The art department extensively modified the house, adding Gothic elements such as beams and stained-glass windows to give it a haunted feel, painting the walls red (although they realized later this made the blood stand out less), and adding a white picket fence.[77][75] The farmhouse-style home offered a "convoluted" layout for a convincing setting where the murders could occur without the other characters realizing. The production crew also added a volleyball net to make it appear as if a teenager lived there.[75]
Santa Rosa High School was selected to portray Woodsboro High School due to its gothic and castle-like imposing visuals.[32][79] Ten days of filming were to take place there in early June at a cost of $30,000 to 50,000, but permission was revoked in March 1996 by the Santa Rosa school district. The change was ostensibly because of the disruption filming would cause during school hours and scheduled exams, but several school board members objected to the violent content in the script, and hundreds of locals attended a council meeting to debate against and for the production; the board ultimately voted against allowing filming.[80][79][32]
The Sonoma Community Center served as a replacement filming location, but scenes had to be rewritten to accommodate the new location and additional costs to transform the former elementary school into one appropriate for young adults, including larger desks and installing lockers.[81][79] Craven estimated the disruption and location changes caused by the Santa Rosa district's decision cost the production $350,000, including the $27,000 the center was paid for three days of filming.[81][71][79] The disruption to filming by the school was not forgotten, with the film's credits stating "No thanks whatsoever to the Santa Rosa city school district governing board."[79]
Williamson's script had not described the killer's appearance beyond wearing a "ghostly white mask".[82][83] Special effects company KNB EFX Group was commissioned to design a mask, but the filmmakers disliked their "gargoyle-ish", witch, and goblin-like masks designs.[82][26][83] While location scouting a house, Maddalena came across what would become the Ghostface mask.[84][83] This mask, featuring a white shroud, was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as "the Peanut-Eyed Ghost" for the novelty company Fun World in 1991, based on a design by makeup artist Loren Gitthens.[85][83] However, Craven and the studio wanted to own the design used in the film and tasked KNB EFX with creating a similar but legally distinct design, stretching the nose and chin.[86][83] Unhappy with the results, Craven eventually decided to pursue the original Fun World design.[86] The killer's outfit was completed with a black shroud to avoid their clothing or movements hinting at their identity.[87]
Filming
edit
Principal photography began on April 15, 1996, on a $14 million budget.[88][26][89][k] The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes.[26] To elicit the necessary emotions, Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate.[26][53] To enhance her performance, Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him.[26][90] Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes, and never met the cast in person.[25][17] He said "the scariest monsters are the monsters you don't see, but the monsters you make in your mind. So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds".[26]
For safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening.[28][91] The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed.[87] Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together. The effect was enhanced with various rubber and vinyl guts.[92] For Steve Orth's death, KNB created an open back chair allowing the actor to kneel behind a hollowed out anatomical mannequin torso cut open at the abdomen and filled with latex, rubber, and gelatin intestines.[93]
After viewing the dailies raw footage, Bob criticized the quality of Craven's work as "workmanlike at best", believing it lacked tension and had an inconsistent tone.[94][25] He was critical of the Fun World Mask—believing it was "flat" and not scary—and ordered that the opening scene be re-filmed with alternative masks to see which worked best.[95][25][96] Barrymore was also criticized for lacking sex appeal because of the pageboy hairstyle she had chosen.[94] Williamson recounted Craven receiving a call from the brothers and seeing "his back slump. He just started sliding down the chair."[95][25] The studio considered firing Craven, and sent him dailies from other films, such as Nightwatch (1997), to demonstrate what they wanted for Scream.[l]
Konrad defended Craven to the brothers, and in response Bob Weinstein sent Dimension executives Cary Granat and Andrew Rona to the set to directly intervene.[94][97] Craven, Konrad, Maddalena, and line producer Stuart M. Besser met with Granat, who wanted the opening reshot with each of the Weinstein's alternative mask suggestions.[25][96] Instead, they offered to edit together the existing footage to prove the scene and mask worked and if it did not, then the project would be cancelled.[m]
Editor Patrick Lussier worked with Craven to piece together most of the opening, adding temporary music and sound effects.[98][26] The Weinsteins barred Craven and the producers from attending screening of the footage.[99] Afterward, Bob Weinstein told the filmmakers, "What do I know about dailies? Keep going", and provided additional financing.[26][25][86][99] The producers suggested Weinstein had an "ulterior motive" to force the filmmakers to complete the footage – the upcoming Milan Film Festival, as edited footage was not typically allowed to be screened until eight weeks after filming concluded.[100]
The next main scene filmed was of the central cast sitting around a fountain. Ulrich admitted he did not realize Scream was intended to be a horror with comedic elements and was confused by Lillard's and Kennedy's "humorous moments", believing they were "ruining the movie ... Like, 'This isn't funny. This isn't supposed to be funny.' And man, was I wrong."[60][89] Craven encouraged improvisation throughout filming, much of it coming from Arquette and Lillard, with Williamson acknowledging that Lillard's ad-libs improved the script.[n]
The finale
edit

The film's 42-minute end sequence set at Stu's party was filmed at night over three weeks.[102][26][75] Issues filming at the location, including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape, exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin's footage. Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio. However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens. The crew, including Lussier, had raised concerns about lens flares and out-of-focus images, partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin.[78] Lussier explained, "You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody's eye usually,  ... and the focus puller just hasn't moved with the actor".[103] As a result, there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus.[104] Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that 35 days of scenes needed to be reshot. After an argument with Maddalena, Irwin was immediately fired and replaced by Peter Deming for the final three weeks of filming.[87][105] Irwin believed he was made a scapegoat for the film's behind-schedule status, risking Craven forfeiting his salary, but Konrad denied this.[104]
Kennedy's horror rules scene was initially performed in a single take, but he requested additional takes, feeling he could enhance the performance (Craven ultimately chose the third take).[27] During Tatum's death scene, McGowan had trouble staying in the pet door as the garage door rose. To address this, the crew nailed her shirt to the frame to hold her in place.[28][9] Craven found it challenging managing the scene's tone, aiming to avoid trivializing Tatum's death while paying homage to other horror films.[101] McGowan improvised the screams for her mother to give the character more humanity.[106] When Gale drives a van with Kenny's corpse on top, Brown was on top of the van, but the unprepared stunt driver accelerated at full speed. When he hit the brakes, Brown fell off the side of the van and the stunt coordinator grabbed Brown's pants and ankle, saving him from harm.[107]
Five nights were spent on the kitchen confrontation between Billy, Stu, and Sidney.[59][3] By the time they had filmed Gale returning with a gun, Ulrich said he and Lillard were "roaming around like caged animals" to keep the intensity of their performances high, to the point Craven asked them to relax because they were scaring Cox. Lillard described maintaining that level of adrenaline as exhausting.[59][102][3] Campbell, Kennedy, Lillard, and Ulrich endured multiple nights covered in fake blood, and the costumes could not be washed to maintain continuity (they were dampened each night to make the blood appear fresh).[26][102][108] When Ulrich stabs a sofa, the filmmakers were unaware it was stuffed with feathers which stuck to the fake blood; Maddalena considered Craven "nuts" for keeping the feathers in the scene.[26] Lillard improvised lines such as "My mom's gonna be so mad at me" and "You fucking hit me with the phone, you dick", the latter taking place when Ulrich threw a phone near him as intended but the sticky blood caused it to veer off and inadvertently hit Lillard.[26][25][91] Ulrich suggested Billy cracking his neck before shooting Gale, and the sound was added in post-production.[59] Campbell's stuntwoman accidentally stabbed Ulrich with an umbrella tip, missing the protective vest he was wearing and hitting the site of an open heart surgery Ulrich had as a child.[107]
Filming concluded on June 14, 1996.[88] The cast spoke fondly of the "summer camp" atmosphere during filming and the camaraderie they formed.[25][109] The main cast and select crew members, including Craven, often gathered together in the early mornings after filming for meals, activities, and socializing.[110][3] Arquette's hotel room was transformed into a makeshift club where they would congregate.[27][31] However, due to complaints from other residents, they eventually relocated their early morning gatherings to a nearby barn.[110]
Post-production
edit
The Scary Movie title remained late into production, appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming.[26][9][111] Harvey Weinstein suggested Scream based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song "Scream".[40][37][112] Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change. Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax, claiming Scream infringed on their copyright of Screamers (1995). The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use Scream going forward.[112] Although Arquette's and Kennedy's characters were killed in the script, alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences.[113][114] The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two Scream sequels.[101]
Scream was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), restricting its audience to those over 17 years of age, which was considered "box-office suicide" by industry experts.[115] The MPAA told Craven that Scream would never receive a more commercial R-rating, allowing younger people to see the film when accompanied by an adult.[115][116][26] Craven said, "I'm a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen. And they ultimately get you, as they did on this one, on intensity. They say, 'it's not a specific shot, it's not blood, it's just too intense'".[116][117] The filmmakers eventually convinced the MPAA that Scream was a spoof, believing they were too focused on the horror aspects.[25]
It took up to nine cuts to address the MPAA's complaints,[36][118] including removing any movement of Steve Orth's internal organs,[116] trimming Kenny's throat being slit (because the actor's pained expression was too "disturbing"), moving Billy and Stu stabbing each other off screen, and reducing scenes of Casey's hanging body and Tatum's crushed head.[25][25][119] The slow motion stabbing of Casey was considered excessive but was allowed with only a few frames removed because there was no alternate footage to use.[25] The final cut runs for 111 minutes.[120]

Marco Beltrami – Sidney's Lament
Duration: 18 seconds.0:18
The theme for the main character of Sidney Prescott by Marco Beltrami
Problems playing this file? See media help.
Despite having no background in film scoring or an interest in the horror genre, Marco Beltrami was recommended to Plec and Craven, who found his music samples original compared with Beltrami's contemporaries.[o] Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose "The Cue from Hell", the score for the film's opening sequence, which secured his hiring. Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey's perspective and used an "operatic" style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass.[124][121][25] Beltrami described himself as "bumbling" through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles.[122][125][124] He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey's theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer.[122][125][124]
Due to budget constraints, Beltrami had to work with a small orchestra of fewer than 50 performers.[126][125] To compensate for the lack of string harmonics, he instructed the string players to whistle, and asked Craven, Lussier, Maddalena, and Woods to join and boost their numbers.[25][127][128] Beltrami identified most with Sidney's character and considered her theme – "Sidney's Lament" – to be one of the score's crucial pieces.[25][126] He chose not to assign a distinctive motif to Ghostface, to avoid hinting at the killer's identity.[125] Licensed music for Scream was provided by TVT Records and includes covers of "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" by Gus Black and "Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)" by Soho, "School's Out" by Alice Cooper, "First Cool Hive" by Moby, and "Drop Dead Gorgeous" by Republica.[129][130][131] Excepts from the Halloween score are also present.[29]

Critical response

Drew Barrymore (left; pictured in 2014) was considered for the role of Sidney Prescott before she was cast as Casey Becker. The Prescott role went to Neve Campbell (right; pictured in 2010). Both were praised for their performances.
Scream received generally positive reviews.[152] Critics, such as Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli, and Owen Gleiberman, praised Scream's meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self-referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense, and criticizing the excessive violence.[q] Some critics said that the film's intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by "sophisticated viewers",[22][166] but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was "defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it".[156]
Janet Maslin wrote that while Scream offered original ideas for the genre, it quickly exhausted them.[162] John Hartl offered a similar sentiment, believing Scream was so focused on referencing other films that it did not know when to "settle down to tell a coherent story".[155] Bill Stamets considered these references insightful, particularly the killers' motives, saying "Killers without motives are far more scary."[161]
Critics such as Berardinelli, Thomas, and Leonard Klady wrote positively of the ensemble cast and their instrumentality in the film's success.[r] Peter Stack and Dave Kehr praised Campbell for her standout performance that successfully carried the central focus on her character, portraying a tough, capable heroine who avoids the "damsel in distress" archetype.[s] While some reviewers appreciated Cox for delivering a strong performance in an against-type role, others criticized her for being unconvincing as a tough and career-obsessed reporter.[t] Thomas and John Hartl wrote that Arquette delivered a "goofily charming" performance.[157][155] Lisa Alspector described Ulrich as the only cast member capable of balancing genuine characterization with self-parody.[167][157][159]
The film's opening sequence received praise for building tension and suspense. Gleiberman and Richard Harrington appreciated the absence of gratuitous nudity in the scene, which was atypical for the genre.[u] Kevin Thomas credited Irwin's "resourcefulness" and Lussier's "razor-sharp" editing as key to Scream's success.[157]
Accolades
edit
At the 23rd Saturn Awards in 1997, Scream won awards for Best Actress (Campbell), Best Writing (Williamson), and Best Horror Film.[169] The film was named Best Movie at the MTV Movie Awards, and Campbell was nominated for Best Female Performance.[170] Scream was named Best Film by the International Horror Guild.[171] Craven also received the Grand Prize at the Gérardmer Film Festival.[172]
Post-release
Thematic analysis

Themes
edit
Scream is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice. In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say "'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back".[26][162][161] This self reference is extended when Randy (Jamie Kennedy), watches Halloween and yells at the lead character Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to look behind her, oblivious to the killer approaching himself from behind. Further, Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera.[161] When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu, she says "You've seen one too many movies", to which Billy replies "Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative."[w] Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real-world violence.[192] Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because "you can't speak that kind of truth".[25]
Writers Adam White and Michelle Delgado wrote that Scream is an exploration of the "exploitative" nature of the news media using traumatic events as entertainment. The debut of Scream coincided with growing discourse in the United States on the impact of on-screen violence and its potential consequences for society. During this time, the Clinton administration introduced the V-chip, a device designed to enable parents to block mature television content. However, news programs remained exempt from the ratings system, which Delgado said continued to "exploit" violent incidents to captivate audiences.[193][194] Gale portrays a relentless television reporter who used Maureen's murder to further her own career and seeks to do the same with the Woodsboro murders. Although Gale advocates for the innocence of Cotton Weary in Maureen's death, she does so both because she believes he is innocent and to secure a lucrative book deal.[193][194][192] While Gale's actions revolve around profiting from the suffering of others, she is depicted not as a villain but a careerist and an antagonist to Sidney who evolves into a heroic figure, aiding in the deaths of Billy and Stu. Gardener wrote that making a living from murder is not morally equal to committing murder, but that it represents the commodification of crime and female trauma. Scream acknowledges the audience's voyeuristic interest in murder and horror, underscoring the monetary value placed on sensationalized crimes.[192]
White described Williamson's script as emblematic of its time, featuring a "picture-perfect" mother raped and murdered in American suburbia and the stalking of her daughter one year later. He compared it to contemporary sensationalized cases such as the Murder trial of O. J. Simpson, Lorena Bobbit's assault of her husband, the Long Island Lolita case, and the Gainesville Ripper.[193] The Ripper's defence included his assertion of being influenced by films such as The Exorcist III (1990). Despite public concerns about the influence of violent media, instances of violent crime were decreasing when Scream was released and there remained no direct link between violent media content and real-life crimes.[194] Even so, public fascination with these media portrayals created a form of celebrity for the victims or perpetrators, with dramatic events being turned into documentaries and films. In Scream, Sidney jokes that a film will be made about the traumatic events of her life and, in the sequels, the film-within-a-film Stab horror series is created, based partly on the events of each preceding Scream entry.[193]
Analysis
edit
Author Padraic Maroney wrote that Scream was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting. The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market.[195] Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven's Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films.[195] The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected. Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven's intention, the film's narrative effectively conveys this theme. She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney's mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents' marriage. Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney's emotional vulnerability caused by her death. In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains.[192]
Scream has been analyzed for homosexual or queer undertones, influenced by Williamson's own experiences as a gay man. He has expressed how his personal struggles informed Sidney's character because he identified parallels between her survival tactics and those of young gay individuals. In a 2021 interview, he said "as a gay kid, I related to the final girl and to her struggle because it's what one has to do to survive as a young gay kid, too. Subconsciously, I think the Scream movies are coded in gay survival."[196] Several publications have highlighted the positive response from gay fans of the franchise to these underlying themes.[197][196][198]
Some writers, such as Maroney, Brant Lewis, and Joe Lipsett, have discussed the theory that Billy and Stu are in a homosexual relationship or that Stu held unrequited feelings for Billy.[x] Professor David Greven wrote that Billy and Stu are representative of the changing notions of masculinity and the underlying currents of queer desire in 90s films. The interactions between them throughout the movie contain themes of homoeroticism, such as when Stu playfully touches Randy's earlobe or leans on Billy during the climax before they stab each other with phallic weapons. Greven believed that although it is easy to assign homosexuality to Stu because of his lack of motive to kill and apparent willingness to please his friend, Billy also features homoerotic characteristics such as the gay trope of fixating on his maternal relationship, similar to Norman Bates in Psycho, and Billy's visual styling resembling actor James Dean, considered a queer icon.[197] Williamson loosely based the characters on Leopold and Loeb,[200] queer individuals who committed murder to prove their intellectual superiority.[y] In a 2022 interview he said he was "very hesitant to present the gay side of me in [Scream]" and that any queerness in Billy's and Stu's characters was "a little coded and maybe accidental".[202]

Scream (Wes Craven, 1996) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Final Girl Archetype (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sidney Prescott is positioned as a traditional “final girl,” but with meta-awareness and evolving agency.
    - Unlike classic slasher heroines, Sidney adapts, fights back, and retains narrative control.

  2. Charismatic Killer (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Billy Loomis and Stu Macher are flippant, articulate, self-aware, and pop-culture literate.
    - Their likability masks psychopathy, leaning on the trope but subverting it with coded subtext and satire.

  3. Pop-Culture Savvy Youths (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Randy Meeks acts as a walking encyclopedia of slasher rules.
    - The device walks a line between insightful parody and overused trope, but is well-integrated.

  4. Faux-Victim Turned Killer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Billy fakes being stabbed to appear a victim.
    - The bait-and-switch tactic is effective but later became widely imitated across the genre.

  5. Overbearing Parent Figure (Low Risk)
    - Example: Maureen Prescott’s posthumous legacy drives the entire plot.
    - Her choices and reputation control the arcs of multiple characters, though she never appears alive on screen.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. Self-Aware Genre Deconstruction (Low Risk)
    - Example: Randy's horror survival rules and the meta-commentary in nearly every scene.
    - Forms the backbone of the narrative and revitalized the horror genre; not just a gimmick.

  7. Red Herring Setup (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Cotton Weary, Neil Prescott, and even Billy himself until he’s “cleared.”
    - The misdirection adds tension, but is a staple trope repeated across many slasher films.

  8. Double Killer Twist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Both Billy and Stu revealed as Ghostface.
    - Highly effective in this first instance, but now an expected twist in ensemble slashers.

  9. Opening Scene Kill (Low Risk)
    - Example: Drew Barrymore’s shocking death.
    - The subversion of casting expectations raised the bar for all future horror openings.

  10. Framed Innocent (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Cotton Weary, falsely convicted of Maureen’s murder.
    - Common in mystery-thrillers, but used here to expand the narrative world across sequels.

  11. House Party Climax (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Stu’s house serves as the setting for the final 42-minute bloodbath.
    - While it’s thematically and logistically functional, it’s a familiar teen horror setup.

  12. Killer Monologue (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Billy’s “movies don’t create psychos” speech, and his justification for revenge.
    - Justified by the genre commentary, but still leans on a standard exposition trope.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  13. Prolonged Chase Scenes (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sidney’s multiple escapes and defensive maneuvers.
    - Tense but grounded in believable spatial logic and character competence.

  14. Masked Killer POV Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Several sequences shot through the lens of Ghostface’s perspective.
    - Classical horror technique; used here with clarity but not innovation.

  15. Horror Score Subversion (Low Risk)
    - Example: Beltrami’s mix of Western themes and horror beats.
    - Underscores suspense while avoiding recycled cues; effective reimagining of genre music.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  16. Female Trauma as Plot Engine (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Maureen’s past as a victim and alleged adulterer directly motivates the killers and drives Sidney’s arc.
    - While addressed and critiqued within the film, it still leans on female suffering to fuel male violence.

  17. Phone Call Threats (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Casey and Sidney’s scenes with the killer voice.
    - Used to iconic effect, but replicates a trope now common in horror films.

  18. Comic Relief Male (Low Risk)
    - Example: Dewey as the bumbling yet lovable officer.
    - Not just comic relief—he’s shown to be brave, competent, and emotionally grounded by the finale.

  19. Twist Ending + Fakeout Kill (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Billy’s final leap at Sidney before she shoots him “in the head.”
    - Now a widely parodied ending beat, but was fresh at the time.

  20. Gratuitous Female Deaths vs. Male Pathology (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Female characters like Tatum and Casey die brutally, while Billy and Stu’s motivations are contextualized.
    - Though the film critiques these tropes, it also embodies them, particularly in its visual excess.

Discussion for the film began following the release of The Wolverine in 2013, with Mangold in negotiations to write the treatment for the film and Lauren Shuler Donner returning to produce. After updates followed that December to May 2016, principal photography began that May, and ended that August, mainly in Louisiana, New Mexico, and Mississippi. The film was designed to look like it takes place in the near future, with slight updates to technology and the social environment, and written with a dark and violent tone closer to the Western than the traditional superhero genre.
Logan premiered at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 3. It was praised by critics for its action scenes, emotional depth, performances, and Mangold's direction, becoming the best-reviewed film in the X-Men franchise. The National Board of Review named Logan one of the top-ten films of 2017, and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 90th Academy Awards, becoming the first live-action superhero film to be nominated for screenwriting. Grossing $619.2 million worldwide, it became the third-highest-grossing R-rated film at its release. Jackman and Keen reprised their roles in the film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024).
Plot
edit
In 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years, and an aging Logan suffers as his healing ability is failing, slowly poisoned by his adamantium skeletal grafts. Working as a limousine driver in El Paso, Texas, he and the mutant tracker Caliban take care of the elderly Charles Xavier, in an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico. Xavier suffers from dementia that causes him to have destructive telepathic seizures, one of which killed several of the X-Men years prior.
Logan reluctantly agrees to escort Gabriela López, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, and a young girl named Laura to Eden, a supposed refuge near the American-Canadian border. After finding Gabriela dead, Logan is confronted by Donald Pierce, Transigen's cyborg chief of security, who was the one who killed her, and was looking for Laura, who has stowed away in Logan's limo and has powers similar to his. She, Logan, and Xavier escape from Pierce and his Reavers, but Caliban is captured. Pierce tortures Caliban into tracking Laura. Xavier and Logan watch a video on Gabriela's phone, revealing that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA to become weapons. The children proved challenging to control and were to be executed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some escape. Xavier reveals to Logan that Laura was created from Logan's DNA and calls her Logan's daughter.
In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in Laura's X-Men comic and tells her it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Xavier has a seizure that incapacitates everyone except Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Xavier with his medication. As they flee, Dr. Zander Rice, the head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.
Logan, Laura, and Xavier help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident, accepting an offer of dinner at their home, where Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm. Rice unleashes X-24, a mindless clone of Logan in his prime created as Transigen's ultimate weapon. X-24 murders Will's family and Xavier before capturing Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers but only injuring Pierce. Logan is outmatched by X-24, but Will pins X-24 with his truck before dying from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Xavier's body.
After burying Xavier, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to prove that the site in North Dakota is not Eden. They find Rictor and other Transigen children preparing to cross into Canada. Laura finds an adamantium bullet that Logan has kept since he escaped from the Weapon X facility, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides not to accompany them, to Laura's dismay.
When the Reavers ambush the children, Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily enhances his healing abilities and boosts his strength. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers before the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago at the Weapon X facility, that no new mutants have been born due to genetically engineered crops created by Transigen and distributed through the world's food supply. Logan, having found a gun, shoots Rice dead and injures Pierce. X-24 fights Logan as the children combine their powers to kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his powers to flip a truck onto X-24, but X-24 frees himself and impales Logan on a large tree branch, mortally wounding him. Laura loads Logan's revolver with the adamantium bullet and shoots X-24 in the head, killing him.
Near death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon she was made to be, and after she tearfully acknowledges him as her father, Logan dies peacefully in Laura's arms. She and the children bury Logan, with Laura reciting as his eulogy the closing speech from Shane, which Logan, Xavier, and she had watched in the Oklahoma City hotel. Before the children depart, Laura tilts the cross on his grave marker to create an X, honoring him as the last of the X-Men.

In July 2016, Cliff Martinez was announced as the composer of Logan's musical score.[165][166][167][168] In December 2016, Mangold announced that Marco Beltrami, who had previously collaborated with Mangold on 3:10 to Yuma (2007) and The Wolverine (2013), would take over from Martinez and score Logan instead.[169]
Beltrami's musical score received critical acclaim, praising the composition and the minimalistic approach.[170] Jonathan Broxton, in his critical review, wrote "there will be a significant disconnect between it and those who grew up listening to Michael Kamen, John Ottman, and John Powell's X-Men scores, because Beltrami's Logan is just so different from anything we have heard in a super-hero movie before. On the one hand, this is commendable; bucking expectations and taking an entirely new approach to a well-defined musical genre is not an easy thing to do, but that's exactly what Beltrami has done here. On the other hand, listeners will still need to be comfortable with music that shifts between being dissonant, ambient, and jazzy, and which has more in common with the work of Ennio Morricone, Jerry Fielding, Elliot Goldenthal, and Bernard Herrmann, than anyone who has scored a super-hero movie before. If you're cool with that, then Logan will find a way to at least entertain you and allow you to experience its unusual tonal palette. If not, then you may find yourself recoiling in horror like Caliban from the sun, or experiencing a psychic attack of your own."[171]

Logan grossed $226.3 million in the United States and Canada and $392.7 million in other countries for a worldwide gross of $619.2 million, against a production budget of $97 million.[2] Worldwide, the film had a global debut of $247.4 million from 82 markets, as well as the second-biggest R-rated IMAX debut, with $20.6 million from 1,068 screens.[240] The film grossed $440.9 million in its first 13 days of release, surpassing the entire theatrical gross of The Wolverine ($414.8 million).[241][242]
United States and Canada

Predictions for its opening in the US and Canada were revised upwards from $55 million to $80 million or even higher.[243][244][245][246][247] Fox, however, predicted an opening in the mid-$60 million range.[248] Some critics said the film's R rating—the second such for a X-Men film—might hinder the film's mass appeal.[244] Two days before the film's release, ticket selling site Fandango reported that the film was outpacing all previous X-Men movies (except Deadpool) at the same point in their sales cycle.[249]
Logan was released in 4,071 theaters, the widest release for an R-rated film, breaking American Sniper's previous record of 3,888 theaters. Five hundred and eighty theatres were premium large-format screens,[243] including 381 IMAX theaters, setting the IMAX record for an R-rated film.[250]
Logan earned $9.5 million from Thursday night previews, which began at 7 p.m. This marked the second-biggest previews in the X-Men franchise, behind Deadpool's $12.7 million.[251] On its opening day, the film scored the biggest R-rated March opening with $33.1 million, breaking 300's previous record, as well as the third-biggest R-rated opening day, after Deadpool ($47.3 million) and The Matrix Reloaded ($37.5 million).[252] Earning a total of $88.4 million during its opening weekend, the film scored the biggest Wolverine movie opening, the biggest R-rated March opening, the fourth-biggest March opening weekend behind Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($166 million), The Hunger Games ($152.5 million) and Alice in Wonderland ($116.1 million), the fifth-largest X-Men opening, and the fourth-biggest R-rated opening weekend overall (ninth in terms of inflation adjusted) behind Deadpool ($132.4 million), The Matrix Reloaded ($91.7 million) and American Sniper ($89.2 million).[253][254][255] This made it the highest opening weekend for a 2017 film at the time of its release, surpassing The Lego Batman Movie ($53 million).[256][257] It was also the biggest R-rated opening weekend that did not take place on a holiday.[258] Additionally, Logan achieved the fifth-highest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film, trailing only behind Deadpool ($132.4 million), Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith ($108.4 million), X-Men: The Last Stand ($102.7 million) and X-Men: Days of Future Past ($90.8 million).[253] About 8.2% of the total ticket sales were in Canada, with premium large formats comprising $12.3 million (15%) from 558 screens, and IMAX comprising $10 million (12%) of the film's total opening weekend.[259]
The opening-weekend audience was 63% males and 83% people between 18 and 44 years old.[259] In an opening-weekend poll conducted by Fandango, 71% of responders said that more superhero films should be rated R, while 86% were interested in seeing a more violent, adult X-Men film that weekend. Furthermore, 96% said they were excited to see Hugh Jackman, 94% were intrigued to see Patrick Stewart reprise his role as Professor X, and 76% were interested in watching newcomer Dafne Keen.[260]
In its second weekend, the film dropped 56.9%, grossing $38.1 million and finishing second at the box office behind newcomer Kong: Skull Island ($61 million).[242] In its third weekend, it made $17.8 million, finishing in third behind Beauty and the Beast ($174.8 million) and Kong: Skull Island ($27.8 million).[261] In its fourth weekend, it made $10.1 million, dropping 43.1% from the previous week and finishing 5th at the box office.[262]
Other countries
edit
Logan was projected to open as high as $105 million. However, US forecasters believed that it could post an even higher opening if it were to overperform in major markets—most notably China. It opened day-and-date in almost every major market except Japan, where Doraemon the Movie 2017 was released. Fox ultimately decided to postpone the film's release there in order to avoid competition.[243] Through Sunday, the film exceeded expectations and posted a five-day opening worth $159 million from 81 markets. This is Fox International's third-biggest launch of all time, behind X-Men: Days of Future Past ($172 million) and Avatar ($164 million).[240] It debuted at No. 1 in 80 markets, surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey ($156 million) to have the highest international opening weekend for an R-rated film. It broke the record for the biggest R-rated IMAX release ever and the biggest 2D IMAX opening, with $10.6 million on 687 screens.[240]
China is the movie's best-grossing market outside America, contributing $106 million in box office.[263] The film was the first to feature an age-restriction warning in its marketing material, as required by a Film Promotion Law that took effect on March 1, 2017. Nevertheless, the film is still trimmed by 14 minutes, totaling 123 minutes. It is very likely that the move was due to usual censorship by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, because of the violence depicted.[264] Despite such restrictions, the film managed to debut with a better-than-expected $48.9 million, including previews, according to data from Ent Group (Fox reported $46.3 million). This marked the second-biggest X-Men opening in the country, trailing behind only Apocalypse. Tracking showed that the film opened with 85,000 screenings on Friday, which increased to about 95,000 on Saturday and Sunday, from a 9.98 million attendance. Included within that total was $4.4 million from 388 IMAX screens.[265]
In Brazil, it recorded the biggest opening for Fox, and the seventh-biggest opening overall, with $8.2 million. The top openings were in China ($46.3 million), Korea ($8.2 million), and Russia ($7.1 million).[240] In the UK, Logan made $11.4 million during its opening weekend, beating The Lego Batman Movie to reach the number one spot, while also achieving the second-highest opening weekend of the year, behind Sing.[266] Meanwhile, in India, the film debuted with an estimated 17 crore ($2.5 million) net, equating to a gross of $3.4 million, on 1,400 screens. According to Fox, that was the highest debut for any X-Men title in the territory, marginally ahead of X-Men: Apocalypse. While the debut was not enough to break any significant records, it ranked as the second-biggest opening weekend for a Hollywood release in the January–March quarter, behind Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[267]
Critical response
edit
 
 
 
The performances of (left to right) Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen received critical acclaim.
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 427 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.0/10. The website's consensus reads: "Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine with a gritty, nuanced performance in a violent but surprisingly thoughtful superhero action film that defies genre conventions."[268] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[269] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak-surveyed audiences gave the film five out of five.[259] Some reviewers noted Logan as one of the greatest superhero films ever made.[270] Critics praised the film for its emotional depth, Mangold's direction, action sequences, screenplay, uncompromising tone, thematic profundity, and the performances of Jackman, Keen and Stewart.[271][better source needed][272][better source needed]
Scott Collura of IGN gave Logan a score of 9.7/10, and called it, "an emotional, heavy picture, but it's also an uplifting one that reminds us that it's okay to fight for something more, something better", and "perhaps the best X-Men movie yet".[273] A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave an 'A−' and said that "[the film] manages to deliver the visceral goods, all the hardcore Wolverine action its fans could desire, while still functioning as a surprisingly thoughtful, even poignant drama—a terrific movie, no 'comic-book' qualifier required".[274] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave it a 'B−', and called it "both the most violent film in the series and the most sentimental one. When it's not showering you in blood, it's trying to make you spill tears."[275] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter reacted positively, saying: "Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology, [director] James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down standalone feature, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman's nuanced turn as a reluctant, all but dissipated hero."[276]
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it four out of five, stating "It is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film, and signals its wintry quality with the title itself" and compared Wolverine's hitting of his truck during the film to Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers.[277] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave it three and a half out of four, and said "In terms of tone and content, Logan is Deadpool's polar opposite but both productions refuse to play by traditional superhero movie rules ... With his glimpse into what superhero movies can be, James Mangold has given us something sadly lacking in recent genre entries: hope."[278] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com stated, "Logan has stakes that feel real, and fight choreography that's fluid and gorgeous instead of just computer-generated effects. Most importantly, Logan has characters with which you identify and about whom you care. It's not just 'great for a superhero movie', it's a great movie for any genre."[279]
Brian Truitt of USA Today said, "Easily the best Wolverine outing, Logan is [the] Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important."[280] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave three and a half out of four, and called it "a hard-ass, R-rated rager that explodes with action".[281] Amy Nicholson of MTV called it "a phenomenal, throat-slashing, gut-stabbing superhero movie".[282] Germain Lussier of io9 said, "Logan is beautiful, sophisticated, and still a kick-ass superhero film".[283] Debbie Holloway of Crosswalk gave the film four out of five, praising how the "script also has several powerful themes, and is truly deft in its handling of them".[284] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound called the film "A game-changing masterpiece".[285] Matt Donato of We Got This Covered said, "It's not just one of the best superhero movies ever, it's a damn-fine cinematic representation of the human condition in all its agonizing forms."[286] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said, "It's the best superhero film to come out of the comic-book world, and I'm not forgetting Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'."[287] Jackman's acting as Wolverine has been praised, and his performance topped The Hollywood Reporter's Greatest Superhero Movie Performances of All Time list.[288]
Anthony Lane of The New Yorker was underwhelmed, commenting on the film's parallel with Shane, "These quiet images (from Shane) brand themselves on the mind, and the gunshots come as an overwhelming release, whereas when Logan and Laura unleash their furious scythes nothing feels settled or satisfied."[289] Mara Reinstein of Us Weekly gave the movie two and a half out of four, in a lukewarm review, said that "[t]he film loses its way during the 20-minutes-too-long journey. For all the breathless talk about how Logan transcends the superhero genre, there's nothing groundbreaking about a road trip movie in which adults try to elude the bad guys to protect a super-special child."[290] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave it two out of four and said, "Logan is deadly serious, and while its gamer-style killing sprees are meant to be excitingly brutal, I found them numbing and, in the climax, borderline offensive."[291] Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine said, "The grim side of human nature is all over James Mangold's Logan. But that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie."[292]

Logan (James Mangold, 2017) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. The Old Warrior (Low Risk)
    - Example: Logan is aged, weary, and suffering physical decline.
    - The trope is given full narrative weight and explored with genuine empathy and depth.

  2. Father-Daughter Surrogate Bond (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan and Laura form a reluctant but emotional parent-child bond.
    - The trope is common in action-adjacent dramas but handled here with rich subtext and gradual development.

  3. Terminal Mentor (Low Risk)
    - Example: Xavier, once powerful, is now frail and mentally unstable.
    - Played with intense vulnerability, providing dignity and danger in equal measure.

  4. Child Weapon Turned Innocent (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Laura is a genetically-engineered killing machine who learns empathy and identity.
    - Despite surface cliché, her arc is individuated and never reduced to simplistic purity.

  5. Comic Relief Mutant (Low Risk)
    - Example: Caliban is used sparingly for tension relief and moral weight.
    - A restrained version of this trope that avoids undermining tone or stakes.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. One Last Job (Low Risk)
    - Example: Logan takes on one final mission despite personal cost.
    - A core structure of many Westerns, used here to deepen existential themes rather than glamorize action.

  7. Road Trip as Redemption (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The journey north becomes a path to self-realization and closure.
    - Familiar structurally but elevated by the bleak setting and the film's refusal to offer easy answers.

  8. Shadow Clone Villain (Medium Risk)
    - Example: X-24 is a mindless, younger version of Logan.
    - As a literal embodiment of Logan’s past and violent legacy, it walks the line between trope and metaphor.

  9. Heroic Sacrifice (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan dies saving the next generation, rejecting his role as weapon.
    - Iconic within genre fiction, but fully earned here by thematic and emotional groundwork.

  10. Corporate Eugenics Conspiracy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Transigen engineers children to suppress and replace mutants.
    - Familiar dystopian trope, but it supports Logan’s political and philosophical tone.

  11. Weaponized Children as Hope (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The new generation of mutants represents salvation for the future.
    - The idea verges on cliché but avoids sentimentality by keeping stakes grounded and ambiguous.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  12. Neo-Western Visual Language (Low Risk)
    - Example: Desert landscapes, long takes, silences, and Shane references.
    - Clear genre homage, but deeply integrated with theme and tone, not just aesthetic mimicry.

  13. Hero Walks into Ambush (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan confronts Rice and Pierce head-on.
    - Standard setup in action drama; partially subverted by Logan’s exhaustion and loss.

  14. Showdown at the Homestead (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Xavier is killed and Laura is kidnapped during the family’s hospitality.
    - Evokes Western massacre tropes; emotionally devastating but narratively familiar.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  15. Mutant Serum as Deus Ex Machina (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan uses a green serum to recover temporarily for the final battle.
    - The effect is telegraphed but serves the structure more than character growth.

  16. Unseen Mass Extinction (Low Risk)
    - Example: No mutants have been born in 25 years, and most are presumed dead.
    - Used for mood and thematic backdrop rather than over-explained world-building.

  17. Legacy Cross (Low Risk)
    - Example: Laura turns Logan’s grave cross into an “X.”
    - Visually powerful and understated—symbolic rather than melodramatic.

  18. Found Family (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The group of mutant children become a new tribe.
    - Common in genre fiction but modestly portrayed without over-sentimental beats.

  19. Offscreen Tragedy Backstory (Low Risk)
    - Example: Xavier’s seizure killed the X-Men, but it’s never shown.
    - Evocative use of implied trauma rather than visual exposition.

  20. Child Recites Classic Film Line as Eulogy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Laura quotes Shane during Logan’s burial.
    - Poignant but recognizable; justified by prior scene integration.

Lionsgate Films began developing a Black Widow film in April 2004, with David Hayter attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the character's film rights had reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with Iron Man 2 (2010), and began discussing a solo film with Marvel. Work began in late 2017 and Shortland was hired in July 2018. Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson contributed to the script before Pearson joined. The film was written to be a prequel that expands on Romanoff's history and helps end her MCU story following the character's death in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Shortland put an emphasis on the fight sequences and said this was the most violent MCU film so far. Filming took place from May to October 2019 in Norway, England, Budapest, Morocco, and Macon, Georgia.
Black Widow premiered at events around the world on June 29, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 9, simultaneously in theaters and through Disney+ with Premier Access. It is the first film in Phase Four of the MCU, and was delayed three times from an original May 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Black Widow broke several pandemic box office records and grossed over $379 million worldwide.[a] The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for the action sequences and for the performances of Johansson and Pugh. In July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against Disney over the simultaneous release, which was settled two months later.
Plot
edit
In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow assassin Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training as Widows. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov's Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia.
In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords.[b] She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control agent. Belova sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials came from Budapest. There she finds Belova, who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still active. Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.
Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows. Vostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. At the Red Room, a secret aerial facility, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff's disguise. He reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage in the Budapest bombing that was so severe Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her. This turned Antonia into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow, but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing her olfactory nerve. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility's engines, and they then lock Taskmaster in a cell.
Dreykov escapes as other Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov's computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane while Belova blows up Dreykov's aircraft, killing him. In freefall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.[b]
In a post-credits scene set after Romanoff's death,[c] Valentina Allegra de Fontaine visits Belova at Romanoff's grave. De Fontaine blames Romanoff's death on Barton and assigns him as Belova's next target.

Background
edit
"What I tried to do was use the backdrop of the splintered Soviet Empire—a lawless insane asylum with 400-some odd nuclear missile silos. It was all about loose nukes, and I felt it was very timely and very cool. Unfortunately, as I was coming up on the final draft, a number of female vigilante movies came out. We had Tomb Raider and Kill Bill, which were the ones that worked, but then we had BloodRayne and Ultraviolet and Æon Flux. Æon Flux didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'"
—David Hayter on his version of the film and why it failed to move forward[61]
In February 2004, Lionsgate acquired the film rights for the Marvel Comics character Black Widow,[62] and in April announced David Hayter as writer and director of the film, with Marvel Studios' Avi Arad producing.[63] By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter did not feel that they found another place "that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously". Hayter said this left him heartbroken, and he hoped the film would be made some day.[64]
Marvel Studios entered early talks with Emily Blunt to play Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Iron Man 2 (2010) in January 2009,[65] but she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels (2010).[66] In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.[67] In September 2010, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but Marvel's focus was on the crossover film The Avengers (2012).[68] Johansson reprised her role in that film,[69] as well as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014),[70] Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),[71] Captain America: Civil War (2016),[72] Avengers: Infinity War (2018),[73] and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[74] After the release of Age of Ultron, Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the "demand of the character", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's positive response to the character and Johansson's performance.[75]
After teasing Black Widow's past in Age of Ultron, Feige said in February 2014 that he would like to see it explored further in a solo film. Development work for this had already started,[76] including a "pretty in depth" treatment by Nicole Perlman who co-wrote Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).[77] The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film and said it would be driven by demand from the audience.[78] That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,[79] while director Neil Marshall said a month later that he "would love to do a Black Widow film". Marshall said he was fascinated by a superhero with "extraordinary skills" rather than superpowers who is also an ex-KGB assassin.[80] In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the character's different layers as depicted in her previous appearances. However, she felt that the character was being "used well in this part of the universe" at that time.[75] While promoting Civil War the next April, Feige noted that due to Marvel's announced schedule of films for Phase Three of the MCU, any potential Black Widow film would be four or five years away.[81] He added that Marvel was "creatively and emotionally" committed to making a Black Widow film eventually.[82]
Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, said in July 2016 that he was open to directing a Black Widow film. He liked the idea of making it a paranoid spy thriller that was "John le Carré on crack".[83] In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, "you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it." She cautioned that she may not want to wear a "skin-tight catsuit" for much longer.[84] The next February, Johansson said she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film "amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone [film] and its own style and its own story."[85] Due to the development work already done and the public support for the project, Marvel Studios decided to move forward with the film at the beginning of the MCU's Phase Four in 2020 following the conclusion of the Infinity Saga storyline in Endgame.[20] Johansson said this decision had become "more of a reality" during the filming of Infinity War. Following Romanoff's death in Endgame, Johansson felt there was "no pressing urgency" to make a Black Widow film and this would improve the project's quality.[10]
Development

Director Cate Shortland at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con
Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a Black Widow film in October 2017. Marvel then began meeting with writers for the project, including Jac Schaeffer and Jessica Gao.[86][87] Gao's pitch was influenced by Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), in which Romanoff would have been planted in a high school to assassinate a target and then 20 years later attends a high school reunion where she has to deal with the fallout of her earlier actions.[87] The pitch heavily featured the character She-Hulk, and Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum felt Gao was instead pitching a She-Hulk film that featured Black Widow. Gao would later be hired by Marvel Studios as the head writer for the Disney+ television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022).[88] Schaeffer met with Feige in December, and was hired to write the screenplay by the end of 2017.[89][90] Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.[91]
Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.[92] By the end of April 2018, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an "extremely thorough" search,[93] including Deniz Gamze Ergüven, Chloé Zhao—who went on to direct Marvel's Eternals (2021)[94]—Amma Asante,[92] and Lynn Shelton.[95] Lucrecia Martel was also approached, but was discouraged when she was told that she would not have to "worry about the action scenes". She also felt the music and visual effects of Marvel films were "horrible".[96] Coralie Fargeat was in contention following the success of her film Revenge (2017), but chose to develop The Substance (2024) instead believing Marvel would not give her final cut privilege.[97] In the following months, a shortlist of 49 directors was made before the top choices of Cate Shortland, Asante, and Maggie Betts met with Feige and Johansson in June.[98] Mélanie Laurent and Kimberly Peirce were also in the "next-to-final mix".[8][99] Johansson was a fan of Shortland's previous female-starring film Lore (2012),[8] and was the one who had approached her about directing the film;[24]: 1  Shortland was hired in July,[8] and watched all of Romanoff's MCU appearances in preparation for making the film.[100]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the "low-seven figure salary" that she earned for starring in The Avengers. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the third films in their MCU franchises—Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok (2017), respectively—as well as for Infinity War and Endgame. Despite The Hollywood Reporter claiming that their report had been confirmed by "multiple knowledgeable sources", Marvel Studios disputed its accuracy and said they "never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms".[101] The Walt Disney Company later said Johansson had earned $20 million by the end of July 2021 for her work on the film,[102] including her role as an executive producer.[103]
As Romanoff dies during the events of Endgame, the film is set earlier in the MCU timeline.[10] It primarily takes place between the main plot of Civil War and that film's final scene, in which the Avengers escape from prison.[104] Johansson and Feige felt this was "the best place to start" because it is the first time that Romanoff is on her own and not tied to a larger organization such as the Red Room, S.H.I.E.L.D., or the Avengers.[10][105] This setting means the film is not an origin story for Romanoff, which Feige wanted to avoid because he felt that was the expected direction for a prequel to go.[25] He was influenced by the television series Better Call Saul (2015–2022), which is a prequel to the series Breaking Bad (2008–2013), calling it "a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... because it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before".[106]
Pre-production
edit
In February 2019, Ned Benson was hired to rewrite the script,[107] and Feige confirmed that, despite rumors, the studio did not want the film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association.[108] The following month, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy,[109] later revealed to be Yelena Belova.[19] Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018, but began looking at other actresses in early 2019, including Saoirse Ronan[20][110] who passed on the role.[111] The studio returned to Pugh after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film Fighting with My Family (2019).[20] Devin Grayson and J. G. Jones, who co-created Belova, expected to receive $25,000 for her role in the film based on a 2007 agreement with Marvel Comics, but ultimately received $5,000 due to a provision in the contract which allowed Marvel to reduce creators' payments;[112] after Grayson went public with this, Marvel agreed to pay her the remaining amount.[113] In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside David Harbour,[27] Rachel Weisz,[34][114] and O-T Fagbenle.[34] An early version of the script included a scene from Civil War featuring Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man,[115] and Downey was reported to be appearing in the film.[116] Fans also expected Jeremy Renner to reprise his MCU role as Clint Barton.[117] Shortland and Feige ultimately decided against including other heroes so Romanoff could stand on her own,[117][118] though Renner does have an uncredited voice-only cameo.[42]
Eric Pearson, who started his writing career in Marvel's screenwriting program and went on to work on several MCU projects, was hired during pre-production to rewrite the film's script again.[13][119] He ultimately received sole screenwriter credit, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credits.[120] Shortland and Johansson had decided to take inspiration from the television series The Americans (2013–2018), which is about a Russian undercover spy family, by introducing Romanoff's own "family" of Russian spies including Belova.[13] When Pearson joined the film, the opening sequence—a prologue set in the 1990s with Romanoff and her "family" living undercover in the Midwestern United States—had already been written.[121] The rest of the film focuses on this family coming back together in the "present day", with a pivotal scene later in the film where they are all reunited around a dining table.[13] Of all the MCU projects that he had worked on, Pearson found Black Widow's setting within the MCU timeline to be the most difficult to get right. This was because he wanted the audience to feel that the villain could succeed without breaking the timeline, which would be difficult considering audiences had already seen Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame. He chose to focus on the Red Room—where the Black Widows are trained—and its leader, who "wields power from the shadows". Pearson thought that the film's spy thriller tone helped alleviate his concerns about the villain.[121][122] A scene at the end of the film in which Thaddeus Ross pursues Romanoff was deliberately left unresolved, as Shortland wanted to leave the audience "on a high" and questioning how Romanoff escapes rather than exhausted with another fight.[123] This is then followed by a scene that connects this film to the end of Civil War by showing Romanoff leaving on a Quinjet to save the Avengers. She is wearing a vest given to her by Belova and has dyed her hair blonde, which matches the character's appearance in Infinity War.[119]
Pearson said there were discussions about ensuring the film was an appropriate farewell for Romanoff. They wanted it to feature "the greatest hits" of the character, including expanding on the backstory that was mentioned in The Avengers. In that film, Romanoff and Barton discuss a past mission in Budapest and there is a mention of "Dreykov's daughter". Black Widow expands on the Budapest hints by having Romanoff return there and revealing some of that mission's details. Dreykov is revealed to be the head of the Red Room, who Romanoff believes to have been killed during the earlier Budapest mission.[122] Johansson wanted the film to comment on the #MeToo movement which saw women supporting each other and "coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side",[124] and this is seen in the way that Romanoff is forced, by the arrival of Belova, to confront Dreykov and her past trauma. Johansson was grateful to have the film to comment on these ideas.[124] Pearson felt the truth behind "Dreykov's daughter" needed to be "something pretty bad. Natasha is ashamed of it. We've been doing allusions to her having a dark past [throughout the MCU]... It had to be something actively tough that she did that haunts her dreams." He settled on the idea that Romanoff and Barton used Dreykov's young daughter as bait to kill him and believed the girl had also died in the process. There was "heated conversation" with Marvel over how much of Romanoff's dark past to show, and Pearson successfully argued for including this element. Early versions of the script included the comic book character Tony Masters / Taskmaster as a villain. Pearson moved towards the more subtle villain Dreykov who he felt fit better into the story and the timeline, but decided to reveal that Dreykov's daughter is alive and now a version of Taskmaster that he compared to a Terminator. He felt this was a way to have some "Marvel fun" within the otherwise grounded story.[122] Fagbenle auditioned for the original version of Taskmaster, who he called a maniac with an African accent, and said the role was down to him and another actor. After the story changes, Marvel asked if Fagbenle was interested in playing Rick Mason instead, which he accepted.[125]
Filming
edit
Principal photography began on May 28, 2019, in Norway.[126] Shortland took inspiration from such films as How to Train Your Dragon (2010),[31]: 63  No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. She looked at combat films and those with armies and militia, allowing her to imagine females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow.[127] Shortland also referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film's fights to resemble "real fights" rather than wrestling matches.[100] She edited together fight scenes from different films into shorts that helped her explore the style of fighting that she wanted in the film. Shortland said this was the most violent film in the MCU and she wanted to approach that aspect with the same "truth" that she was approaching the rest of the film.[117]
Early reports suggested that Rob Hardy would be the film's cinematographer, but he left the production before filming began. Gabriel Beristain served as cinematographer instead,[128] having previously done so for the Marvel One-Shot short films Item 47 (2012) and Agent Carter (2013), for the television series Agent Carter (2015–2016),[24]: 3 [129] and for additional photography on Iron Man (2008) and six other MCU films.[130] Beristain was initially not credited in Black Widow's trailers, as pointed out by Jeff Sneider at Collider who wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting the cinematographer at that point. Sneider felt Beristain would be credited in later marketing materials,[128] and his hiring was confirmed in the film's official press advance.[24]: 3  Beristein later confirmed that he joined the film after production had already begun, opting to leave a television directing job and move to London so he could be the main cinematographer for an MCU film.[130] Shortland preferred to avoid technical equipment where possible and prioritize natural lighting, which provided a challenge for Beristain in having to match the light of the location shoots to later additional photography filmed in Los Angeles. The naturalistic approach was also reflected in interior scenes, lighting from outside the set or using lights with strong diffusion to create the same effect. An anamorphic format was chosen to highlight the expansive movements and landscapes in the film, with a special system used that split the camera's image sensor from its body to help with this approach.[131]
 
Hankley Common in Surrey, England, was made to look like a Russian farmstead for the film.[132][133]
The production moved to Pinewood Studios in London in early June.[134] Shortland hired someone to help Johansson and Pugh bond through trust exercises and other bonding activities, but the pair felt their "real bonding" happened during Pugh's first two days of filming when they were working on an early fight scene between Romanoff and Belova. Pugh had some stunt experience from her work on Fighting with My Family, and Johansson gave her advice that she had received from Samuel L. Jackson while working on Iron Man 2. Pearson was on set to hear a joke from Pugh about the "ridiculous" pose that Johansson often lands in while fighting as Romanoff throughout her MCU appearances, which led to him adding some jokes from Belova to Romanoff about the poses in the script.[135] Ray Winstone joined the film's cast later in June,[49] when filming took place on location in Budapest.[136] 13 BMW X3s were used to create a car chase involving Romanoff and Belova in Budapest, with the crew often switching off the electronic stability control and safety assistance functions to be able to do what the script asked for. They also swapped the X3's electronic parking brake for a hydraulically actuated one. Second unit director Darrin Prescott explained that the crew would often "replace the engine or tear the entire body off the car and rebuild it from scratch". The sequence's plot and locations were adjusted to help Prescott create the "spontaneous" stunts that he wanted.[37]
Shooting took place in mid-July 2019 at Hankley Common in Surrey, England, under the working title Blue Bayou. The site was made to look like a Russian farmstead, with added helicopter crash sites. The Thursley Parish Council objected to this filming, as it had occurred while Marvel Studios' application to use the site was still pending. The production planned to revisit the site in late August for further filming.[132][133] Black Widow was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con later in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.[19] In August, bodybuilder Olivier Richters revealed that he had been cast in the film,[137] playing a character that was subsequently confirmed to be Ursa Major.[42][59] That same month, crew undertook scanning and texture photography at the Well-Safe Guardian oil rig in the North Sea as a reference for visual effects.[138] A wrap party was held at the end of September, before production moved to Macon, Georgia, for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including Terminal Station, were dressed to portray Albany, New York.[139] Set photos from the start of October revealed that William Hurt would appear in the film, reprising his MCU role as Thaddeus Ross.[47] Additional filming in Georgia took place in Atlanta and Rome.[140] Also in early October, filming took place in Tangier, Morocco, with local production services provided by Zak Productions.[141][142] Principal photography lasted for 87 days[24]: 3  and officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.[143]

Matthew Schmidt and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as editors on the film.[24]: 3  Pearson said the film's handling of Romanoff's Budapest backstory had been "85% cracked" prior to the start of filming, and the rest was determined during the editing process as well as additional photography.[122] Winstone disliked returning for the additional photography, feeling his performance was being criticized by Marvel Studios executives. He wanted his role to be recast instead, but was contractually obligated to return.[144] A scene of Romanoff wearing underwear and a T-shirt that Shortland enjoyed due to "how sexy [Johansson] is [when] she's in control" was cut from the film because test audiences criticized the scene as using the "male gaze".[100] Black Widow is one of the few Marvel films to feature an opening credits sequence, which Feige explained was because Shortland felt strongly about exploring what Dreykov is responsible for at the beginning of the film.[145][146] The sequence was designed by Perception, who worked with Shortland to film various vignettes on set that were made to look as if they were captured on 8 mm film, 90's digital video, and VHS. These were combined with old photographs and documents that Perception's team created and manipulated to tell the story.[147]
In mid-March 2020, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[148] In early April, Disney announced that Black Widow would be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted to accommodate this.[149] In September 2020, Disney pushed the release back again to May 7, 2021,[150] followed by a third shift in March 2021 to July 9, 2021.[151] In April 2021, following Julia Louis-Dreyfus's appearance as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the Marvel Studios television series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair reported that Louis-Dreyfus had been expected to first appear in Black Widow before the delays pushed its release to after The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's premiere on Disney+.[152] Feige later confirmed this, explaining that Black Widow's post-credits scene was originally intended to be the character's introduction but instead became a reference to her appearance in the series. He said this was the only change to Marvel's Phase Four plans that was forced by the pandemic.[153] The post-credits scene was added after Hawkeye (2021) showrunner Jonathan Igla expressed interest in having Yelena Belova appear in his series. Pearson was asked to write the scene, in which De Fontaine assigns Clint Barton as Belova's next target, without knowing who the target would be.[154] Shortland considered the setting of the scene, at Romanoff's grave in a remote clearing, to be a response to fans who were upset that Romanoff did not receive a funeral in Endgame. Shortland said the character was private and would not have wanted a large funeral, so this scene allowed the character's ending "to be the grief the individuals felt, rather than a big public outpouring".[25][155] Shortland said in May 2021 that the film had been completed a year prior and had not been altered, despite the release delays.[156] Olga Kurylenko's role as Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster was revealed with the film's release.[38]

The film's visual effects vendors included Cinesite, Digital Domain, Industrial Light & Magic, Mammal Studios, SSVFX, Scanline VFX, Trixter, and Wētā FX.[157] Digital Domain was responsible for the final battle sequence and completed around 320 visual effects shots for the film. They created the Red Room, an airborne fortress hidden in the clouds, which was inspired by the brutalist architecture of the Soviet Union.[158][159] A combination of practical and visual effects were used to create the sequence where the Red Room is destroyed and falls from the sky: actors and stunt performers were filmed in a wind tunnel against bluescreens while being held with wires and mechanical arms, and the surrounding environment of sky and debris was created digitally.[158][159] Cinesite primarily handled the Russian prison that Harbour's Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian is found in.[160] Wētā FX created the mountain range that surrounds the prison, based on photography from Svalbard, Norway, as well as an avalanche. Wētā also created the Mil Mi-8 helicopter that is seen in that sequence,[161] while Cinesite created it for other sequences.[160] For the pigs on the farm of Weisz's Melina Vostokoff, Wētā filmed live Kunekune pigs as reference for the digital pigs in the final shots.[161]
Industrial Light & Magic completed approximately 800 VFX shots for the film, working on the opening airplane escape scene, the Budapest apartment fight and subsequent motorcycle and car chase, and the fight between Romanoff and a group of Black Widows in Dreykov's office. The opening airplane scene was created with half of an airplane rig on a hydraulic platform. Footage filmed on location in Atlanta was played on LED screens on the soundstage to create interactive lighting for the actors on set. To create the Budapest scenes, ILM worked with second unit director Darren Prescott. Romanoff and Belova's chase across the rooftops was a combination of practical and visual effects, while scenes involving smokestacks were created using virtual actors. The car chase scene in Budapest features a practical tank driven by Taskmaster that was created by Paul Corbould, the film's special effects supervisor. Digital cars were added to the scene to make it appear more dangerous and for better interaction with the tank. For the fight scene in Dreykov's office, ILM worked on the graphic displays in the background as well as the lighting that interacts with the Widows' bodies.[162] In addition to creating the film's opening credits sequence, Perception designed the graphics for Dreykov's screens and other Red Room technology, researching Soviet Union technology for inspiration.[163] Trixter created Taskmaster's mask and worked on several action sequences as well.[160]
Music
edit
Main article: Black Widow (soundtrack)
Alexandre Desplat was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.[164] Late in post-production, Lorne Balfe replaced Desplat as composer, which Desplat confirmed in May 2020.[165][166] Balfe briefly references Alan Silvestri's motif for Romanoff and main theme for the Avengers from The Avengers in the score,[167][168] but otherwise wanted to focus on creating a new identity for Romanoff. His discussions with Shortland led to him writing an original piece in the style of Russian folk music that he thought Romanoff and Belova may have grown up listening to. The rest of his score developed from that piece, and also took inspiration from Russian composers Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. Balfe completed recording for the score at Abbey Road Studios as the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact studio recording sessions.[167]
The film's opening credits sequence features a cover of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Think Up Anger, featuring Malia J,[16] which was suggested by Perception.[147] "American Pie" by Don McLean and "Cheap Thrills" by Sia are also featured in the film.[169] A soundtrack album featuring Balfe's score was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on July 9, 2021.[170]

Box office

Black Widow grossed $183.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $196.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $379.8 million.[3][4] The film's opening weekend earned $226.2 million globally, which included $80.4 million at the domestic box office, $78.8 million at the international box office, and $67 million in Disney+ Premier Access global revenue.[6][7] The opening weekend gross was within or had exceeded various pre-release projections.[192][232] In June 2021, Fandango reported that the film had the most ticket presales in 2021, and surpassed other MCU films from previous years like Doctor Strange (2016) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[233]
Black Widow earned $39.5 million on its opening day, including $13.2 million from Thursday night previews, which was the best preview night and opening day since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Its total weekend gross was $80.4 million, making it the top film of the weekend.[5][234][235] This was the largest box office opening since the COVID-19 pandemic began, surpassing F9's opening of $70 million,[195] and the largest opening weekend since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).[5] The domestic gross was within some of the pre-release projections for the film,[192][232] but it was below some updated industry projections that were made during the weekend after the opening night and preview grosses were known; Deadline Hollywood partially attributed this to the film's availability on Disney+ with Premier Access.[5] When the $80.4 million theatrical gross was combined with the domestic Premier Access revenue of $55 million, totaling over $135.4 million for its opening weekend, Disney noted that Black Widow was the only film to surpass $100 million in domestic consumer spend on opening weekend since the start of the pandemic, and it marked the third largest opening ever for an MCU origin film behind Black Panther ($202 million) and Captain Marvel ($153.4 million).[5][225] Following its opening weekend, Black Widow posted the largest non-holiday Monday ($7.16 million) and Tuesday ($7.6 million) gross in the pandemic.[236] The film passed $100 million at the domestic box office in six days, the fastest to do so in the pandemic.[237]
In its second weekend, the film grossed $25.8 million,[238] finishing second behind Space Jam: A New Legacy. Its 67% drop marked the largest sophomore week decline for an MCU film, passing Ant-Man and the Wasp (62%).[239] Box office analysts attributed Black Widow's second-week decline to its Disney+ Premier Access release, as well as widely reported piracies of the film online.[240][241] In its third weekend, the film earned a further $11.6 million and became the fastest film to reach $150 million in total domestic box office gross in the pandemic.[242][243] Black Widow was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States and Canada.[244]
Outside of North America, Black Widow earned $78.8 million in its opening weekend, from 46 markets. It was the number one film in nearly all of these markets, including the markets in the Asia Pacific region where it opened—excluding Japan, where it was third[6][245]—and all markets in the Latin America region. Black Widow had the top pandemic opening weekend in 15 European markets. IMAX accounted for $4.8 million of the weekend gross, from 59 countries, 11 of which set opening weekend records for the pandemic. In South Korea, the film's opening day was the second-best of 2021, with $3.3 million, and Hong Kong had the best opening of the pandemic, with $3.2 million. The film had the largest opening day of the pandemic in Austria, the Czech Republic, Qatar, and Slovakia, while in Saudi Arabia, the film earned the highest opening day for a Disney release ever. It was the number one film on opening day in many other markets. As of October 2021, the top markets for the film outside of North America were South Korea ($26.3 million), the United Kingdom ($25.8 million), and France ($15.1 million).[3][6]
Streaming viewership
edit
With Disney+ Premier Access, Black Widow earned $67 million worldwide in its opening weekend.[6][7] It was the first film that Disney revealed Premier Access revenue for, with the revenue skewing heavily towards the United States with $55 million.[5][225] Viewer tracking application Samba TV, which measures at least five minutes of viewership on smart televisions in over 3 million U.S. households, reported that 1.1 million households watched the film in its opening weekend. Deadline Hollywood noted that this viewership translated to about $33 million in revenue for Disney, considering the US$30 price of Premier Access, which lined up with the announced worldwide revenue.[246] The site also stated that Disney was receiving about 85% of the Disney+ Premier revenue, sharing the rest with platform providers such as Amazon Firestick and Apple TV+.[247]
The following weekend, Deadline Hollywood reported that Black Widow had become the most-pirated film of the past week,[239] while some industry sources believed it had become the most-pirated film of the pandemic.[248] Samba TV later updated the film's Disney+ Premier Access viewership, reporting that the film had been streamed over 2 million times in the U.S. over its first 10 days of release, which resulted in around $60 million in overall domestic revenue from Disney+. Samba TV also reported updates to 10-day viewership in the United Kingdom (258,000), Germany (116,000), and Australia (47,000).[247] In October, Samba TV reported that over 1.1 million U.S. households had watched Black Widow in the first five days of its availability to all subscribers on Disney+. They also reported viewership in the United Kingdom (190,000) and Germany (96,000) during that same time frame.[249] As of August 2021, Black Widow had earned $125 million through streaming and digital downloads.[224] In its first 30 days, the film was watched in over 2.8 million U.S. households. Deadline Hollywood reported the film had been pirated over 20 million times, resulting in at least $600 million in lost revenue for Disney.[250] In January 2022, tech firm Akamai reported that Black Widow was the third-most pirated film of 2021.[251]
Critical response
edit
 
 
The performances of Scarlett Johansson (L) and Florence Pugh (R) were praised by critics.
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 79%, with an average score of 6.9/10, based on 462 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Black Widow's deeper themes are drowned out in all the action, but it remains a solidly entertaining standalone adventure that's rounded out by a stellar supporting cast."[252] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 58 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[253] Critics commonly praised the cast, particularly Johansson and Pugh, as well as the action sequences.[254][255][256] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported that 88% of audience members gave it a positive score and 69% said they would definitely recommend the film.[5]
Owen Gleiberman of Variety initially feared that Black Widow would just be two hours of Johansson fighting, but found the film to be more interesting than that despite still having fight sequences that would "give a mainstream audience that getting-your-money's-worth feeling". He praised Shortland's direction and said, "from the opening credits, most of it has a gritty, deliberate, zap-free tone that is strikingly—and intentionally—earthbound for a superhero fantasy".[16] Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney felt the film's move away from the superhero genre into a "high-octane espionage thriller" made it a more satisfying female-starring MCU film than the "blandly bombastic" Captain Marvel.[257] At IGN, Nicole Clark discussed the ambition of the film to go beyond the superhero genre to explore the abuse and "intense tragedy" from Romanoff's past.[258]
At The Hollywood Reporter, Rooney described the film as a "stellar vehicle" for Johansson and praised her vulnerability in the film,[257] while Gleiberman said Johansson "holds the film together and gives it its touch of soul" with her vulnerability which he said was unusual for a superhero film performance.[16] Several critics praised the film's supporting cast,[256] with the chemistry between Johansson and Pugh in particular a highlight.[254] Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood said "Natasha's awkward shyness [is] counterpunched by the lively and cynical Yelena", and praised Johansson's presence in her role. He felt Pugh was ready to lead her own franchise and also praised the performances of Weisz, Harbour, and Winstone.[259] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the relationship between Romanoff and Belova was the "real love story" of the film,[260] and Nicole Clark felt the film was at its strongest in the scenes where the pair were fighting against or beside each other.[258] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said Pugh was the film's MVP and had found "just the right shades of strength and vulnerability".[261] Caryn James at the BBC also praised Pugh and said Belova was "more lived-in than most action-movie characters".[262]
IndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B grade, saying it delivered on action and praising the lower stakes. He positively compared the film's fight sequences to the Bourne franchise and said, "If this is the last time we get to see Johansson mete out justice to her assailants with gymnastic velocity, it's an apt send-off."[263] Hammond of Deadline Hollywood agreed, writing that Johansson "goes out with all guns blazing as this [film...] does not stint one bit on the action".[259] Gleiberman also compared the film to the Bourne franchise,[16] while James compared it to the Mission: Impossible franchise and said it was "the least Avenger-like movie in the [MCU] so far". She gave the film four out of five stars, but did criticize the ending as being typical of the franchise.[262] Writing for Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson praised Shortland's direction of the action sequences and the film's more grounded physics.[264]
Despite calling the film stylish and fun, Joshua Rivera of Polygon said it came across as "hollow" and like an "apology" for Romanoff's death in Endgame.[265] Similarly, Hoai-Tran Bui at /Film felt the film was "too little, too late" after the character's death,[266] and Matt Goldberg at Collider felt the film wasted the chance to further explore the Budapest mission in Romanoff's past in favor of introducing Belova as a replacement Black Widow.[267] Ann Hornaday at The Washington Post had similar thoughts, noting the set-up for Pugh to continue in the franchise and feeling the film did not make up for Johansson getting "short shrift" in earlier MCU installments.[268]

Black Widow (Cate Shortland, 2021) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Tragic Past Heroine (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha’s past as a child assassin and her guilt over “Dreykov’s daughter.”
    - While effective in giving her complexity, it relies on overused trauma-as-backstory beats.

  2. Surrogate Sister Dynamic (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha and Yelena form a quippy, tense, but ultimately affectionate bond.
    - The chemistry is praised, and the relationship avoids lazy rivalry or idealized sisterhood.

  3. Female Assassin Turned Redeemer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha works to dismantle the Red Room and save future Widows.
    - A genre staple but balanced here with commentary on systemic abuse and manipulation.

  4. Stoic Spy as Action Lead (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha keeps her cool under pressure, relying on cunning over superpowers.
    - Her emotional restraint is integrated with plot rather than flat character masking.

  5. Comic Relief Sidekick (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Alexei’s bluster and self-importance provide levity.
    - Frequently veers into broad caricature but has occasional emotional beats.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. Found Family of Misfits (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha reunites with her spy “family” for one last mission.
    - A well-worn setup that gains freshness through tonal whiplash between dysfunction and care.

  7. Face-Switch Reveal (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha and Melina swap identities using mask tech.
    - Classic spy trickery that fits the genre and timeline naturally.

  8. Evil Father Figure (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dreykov rules over the Widows with controlling and dehumanizing systems.
    - Real-world metaphors are embedded, but the depiction borders on mustache-twirling villainy.

  9. Chemical Mind Control (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Widows are controlled via engineered pheromone blockers and chemical agents.
    - Narrative function is solid, but the trope is well-worn in sci-fi and spy genres.

  10. Brainwashed Super Soldier (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Taskmaster is revealed to be Antonia, now programmed for violence.
    - Conceptually rich but limited character agency makes her arc feel underexplored.

  11. One Final Mission Before the End (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha confronts her past before rejoining the Avengers.
    - Typical framing for “prequel-finale,” but helps reframe her legacy.

  12. Redemption via Sacrifice (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha’s arc concludes with a mission focused on freeing others.
    - Earned within the character's legacy; avoids overly sentimental framing.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  13. Midair Fortress Collapse (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Red Room explodes mid-sky, triggering a high-altitude fall sequence.
    - Visually elaborate but narratively familiar; nearly every major spy/superhero film has a sky-fall.

  14. Rooftop Chase and Car Crashes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha and Yelena flee Taskmaster across Budapest.
    - Highly kinetic but structured around genre-standard geography and beat progression.

  15. Dual Fight Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Shostakov vs Taskmaster and Romanoff vs Widows occur simultaneously.
    - Adds momentum but relies on typical parallel fight structure to maintain tension.

  16. Feminine Grit Gaze (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Opening credits juxtapose young girls’ faces with oppressive Cold War imagery.
    - Intense and ambitious, but runs the risk of stylizing real trauma into genre mood.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  17. Antagonist Reveal Twist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Taskmaster is actually Dreykov’s daughter.
    - While thematic, the twist lacks emotional payoff due to limited character development.

  18. Sentimental Object as Legacy (Low Risk)
    - Example: Yelena’s vest is passed to Natasha, later seen in *Infinity War*.
    - Works well to bridge character continuity; subtle and tactile.

  19. Villain Monologue Before Escape (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dreykov gloats before narrowly escaping.
    - Standard genre habit, but here it costs narrative urgency.

  20. Posthumous Retcon Tribute (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha’s grave and Yelena’s visit retroactively frame her MCU death with meaning.
    - Emotionally effective, but a classic device to retrofit emotional closure.

Production went through various phases in development since 2013, beginning with Warner Bros. Pictures after beating Hasbro and Universal Pictures in a lawsuit over the film rights to the tabletop game, before moving to Paramount Pictures, each with various writers and directors. Goldstein and Daley were the final writers/directors, using elements from the previous attempt by director Chris McKay and screenwriter Michael Gilio. Filming began in April 2021 in Iceland and later Northern Ireland.
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2023, and was released in the United States on March 31 by Paramount. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of the cast, the direction, visual effects, writing, score, humor, and tone. It grossed $208.2 million worldwide on a $150 million budget, making it a box office disappointment.[13]
Plot
edit
Prior to imprisonment, bard Edgin Darvis served in the Harpers, an order of peacekeepers, until his wife was killed by disciples of a Red Wizard he arrested.
Accompanied by barbarian Holga Kilgore, Edgin attempted to make a new life for himself and his daughter Kira by turning to theft, teaming with amateur sorcerer Simon Aumar, rogue con artist Forge Fitzwilliam, and Forge's mysterious acquaintance Sofina. While raiding a Harper stronghold, Edgin attempted to steal a "Tablet of Reawakening" to resurrect his wife, but he and Holga were captured, though their accomplices escaped.
After two years' imprisonment in frozen Revel's End, Edgin and Holga escape to Neverwinter and learn Forge has become Lord there after its prior Lord was mysteriously incapacitated. He has been taking care of Kira, convincing her that Edgin's greed led to his arrest. It is revealed that Sofina is a Red Wizard and together they orchestrated Edgin and Holga's capture.
Sofina orders Edgin and Holga's execution, but they escape and decide to rob Forge's vault and bring Kira home during the upcoming High Sun Games, needing the tablet to prove their innocence to Kira and resurrect Edgin's wife. Edgin and Holga track down Simon to help. With his help, the group also recruits Doric, a druid whose forest community is fighting forced logging ordered by Forge.
After shapeshifting into a fly, Doric infiltrates Forge's castle and finds the vault has magical defenses from Mordenkainen, which Simon cannot disable. He believes the magic relic, "The Helm of Disjunction," could help, and the group travels to a graveyard to ask Holga's ancestors where to find it. Simon resurrects the dead with a talisman long enough for them to answer the group's questions. The corpses reveal they gave the Helm to Xenk Yandar, a paladin who fled Thay, his country, when Red Wizard Szass Tam turned Thayans into an undead army.
After forcing Edgin to swear to distribute any gained bounty to the people, Xenk guides the group through the Underdark to retrieve the Helm. With the help of a teleportation staff obtained from Holga's halfling ex-husband, they find the relic but are attacked by Thayan assassins sent by Sofina. Xenk fights them off and helps the group escape from the obese red dragon Themberchaud before departing.
Simon has trouble mastering the Helm's power, so they decide to use the staff to enter the vault during the games. Simon and Holga infiltrate the vault but find the room empty except for a magical trap. Sofina, disguised as Kira, subdues Edgin. The group is captured and forced to participate in the games, but escapes the stadium. Doric discovers Forge has loaded the treasure onto a boat and is preparing to flee. The group steals the boat for themselves and rescues Kira from Forge.
As they escape, the group realize Sofina organized the games to draw a massive crowd and turn them into an undead army using the curse that destroyed Thay. The group returns, transporting Forge's stolen riches out of the boat with the teleportation staff and spreading them across the city by hot-air balloon, drawing people out of the stadium before Sofina's spell takes effect.
Enraged at her failure, Sofina attacks the group. Simon nullifies her time-stop spell, allowing Kira to use the invisibility pendant Edgin and Holga gave her as a child to place an anti-magic bracelet on Sofina. Although the group manages to incapacitate Sofina, Holga is fatally injured. Edgin uses the tablet to bring her back to life, realizing he wanted to bring back his wife only for his own sake, while Holga had become a true part of their family. Doric expresses being open to a relationship with Simon.
Restored, the old Lord of Neverwinter declares the team heroes of the realm. Xenk sends Forge to Revel's End, where he fails to escape as Edgin and Holga did when his pardon is denied.

Development and casting
edit
In May 2013, Warner Bros. Pictures and Courtney Solomon's Sweetpea Entertainment announced a film based on Dungeons & Dragons with David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick writing the script and Roy Lee, Alan Zeman, and Solomon producing.[30] Two days later, Hasbro issued a lawsuit saying that they were co-producing a Dungeons & Dragons film at Universal Pictures with Chris Morgan writing and directing.[31][32][33][34][35] In August 2015, after U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee urged Sweetpea Entertainment and Hasbro to settle the film rights case, the Warner Bros. film was set for pre-production with Hasbro.[36] In March 2016, Rob Letterman was in negotiations to direct Johnson-McGoldrick's script,[37] with his role confirmed in May 2016.[38] In April 2017, actor Joe Manganiello, an avid fan of Dungeons & Dragons, revealed that he had written a script with John Cassel for the project and was "talking to all the right parties" to make the film happen.[39] Upon completing the script, Manganiello worked in collaboration with Brad Peyton and Dwayne Johnson, who were both in negotiations to develop the film.[40]
In December 2017, after varying degrees of progression, the film was moved by Hasbro to Paramount Pictures and was scheduled for a release date of July 23, 2021.[41] In February 2018, Paramount was in talks with both Chris McKay and Michael Gilio to direct and write the film, respectively.[42] In March 2019, it was revealed that Gilio had completed a first draft and studio executives expressed excitement for the film. The studio began negotiations with various talent, as the casting process began.[43] In July 2019, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley were in talks to direct.[44] Goldstein and Daley began meeting with Paramount following Daley talking about his career with a literary agent at a sports bar in Sherman Oaks during a game between the Chicago Cubs, which Daley is a fan of, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. After saying to the agent that he and Goldstein had left directing duties on The Flash, the agent asked if they were looking for work. The agent tipped off Paramount, who presented Goldstein and Daley with the script for Dungeons & Dragons.[45]
In June 2016, Ansel Elgort was in talks to star in Letterman's iteration of the film.[46] In December 2020, Chris Pine was cast to star in the film.[47] Michelle Rodriguez, Justice Smith, and Regé-Jean Page were added in February 2021.[48][49] Hugh Grant and Sophia Lillis would join the next month, with Grant cast as the antagonist.[50] In April, Chloe Coleman joined the ensemble cast.[51] In May, Jason Wong and Daisy Head joined the cast.[52][53] During post-production, Bradley Cooper was cast in a cameo role. He filmed his part on blue screen and was inserted into preexisting footage shot with Rodriguez.[54]
Writing
edit
By January 2020, Goldstein and Daley announced that they had co-written a new draft of the script.[55][56] Ultimately, Daley, Goldstein, and Gilio received screenplay credit, while McKay and Gilio received story credit.[57] The film is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons.[58][2] Goldstein stated that "ours is a movie that doesn't take itself with great seriousness, but it's never a spoof. It honors the world of D&D and celebrates it but, hopefully, it gives the audience an engaging and fun ride".[59] Daley commented that the film's influences include The Princess Bride, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Lord of the Rings, and Indiana Jones, with the Indiana Jones structure evoking both a "dungeon crawl" and the heist film genre that they wanted to draw on. Daley highlighted that the heist genre is familiar to the audience, which provides the framework for the "uninitiated" so that "they understand what our characters are setting out to do without being overwhelmed by lore or proper nouns".[59] Daley also wanted the film to be accessible for those unfamiliar with the fantasy genre.[60] The Austin Chronicle highlighted "since the basis of most tabletop campaigns is a group of strangers coming together to complete a job, the thematic parallels between heist movies and fantasy roleplaying campaigns offer a shared language for newcomers".[60]
Goldstein commented that they use the sorcerer character in the film to address why magic can't "solve all problems"—"it makes storytelling nearly impossible if you can solve any problem with a magical spell".[59] Goldstein stated that when discussing the visual presentation of the film with Daley that they decided they didn't want "two people standing there with their hands out and rays coming out of their hands".[60] As a result, the film pulls directly from the magic system of Dungeons & Dragons with magic users "combining physical components and verbal spellcasting to show a variety of magical effects onscreen".[60] Justice Smith, who plays the sorcerer, commented that he worked with the choreographer "to create unique gestures for each spell" with many of the spells incorporating actual sign language into the gestures.[61][62]
Filming and visual effects
edit
Filming began in early April 2021, with a crew of 60–70 people in Iceland.[63] Principal photography commenced in Belfast, Northern Ireland later that month.[64][65] Goldstein stated that when the cast arrived in Northern Ireland they "played a several-hours-long game of D&D" with the actors role-playing as their film characters which "gave those who were not familiar with [D&D] a quick taste of what the game is like and how you interact".[59] This game "also informed the directors' takes on the characters" with Goldstein commenting that "I think we incorporated some of the things we learned from that game into the film".[59] On August 19, 2021, Daley announced that filming had completed.[66] The visual effects are provided by Industrial Light & Magic, Moving Picture Company and Crafty Apes.[67]
Music
edit
Main article: Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (soundtrack)
Lorne Balfe scored the film; Balfe stated "I used to play Dungeons, so when I heard they were making that, I knew I wanted to be part of the team".[68] On March 10, 2023, Tame Impala released the single "Wings of Time" for the film.[69][70] Marisa Mirabal, for IndieWire, wrote that "Balfe heightens the tension with a unique mixture of verbal chanting and rhythmic beats that properly enhance the meticulous stuntwork. The score morphs into a creature of its own and is unlike the soothing, sweeping scores of other fantasy films. Balfe also successfully leans into the bard lore of Pine's character by composing songs that are light-hearted, poetic, and heavy with string instruments".[71] The soundtrack album for the film was released on March 31, 2023, by Mercury Classics Soundtracks & Scores label.[72]
On March 19, Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez revealed that the track "l'Emprise" appearing on Mylène Farmer's eponymous album will be on the soundtrack in French-speaking countries.[73]
A companion album was released on June 23, 2023, with 14 songs inspired by the world of Taverns in Dungeons & Dragons, written by Lorne Balfe with directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley.[74]

Box office

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves grossed $93.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $114.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $208.2 million.[6][12]
After the premiere at South by Southwest, A.A. Dowd at Chron noted that "the reaction at the Paramount Theatre last night suggests that this could be a bigger hit than plenty have predicted, if word of its canny exploitation of the Marvel model travels fast and far."[112] In the United States and Canada, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was released alongside A Thousand and One and His Only Son, and was projected to $30–40 million from 3,850 theaters in its opening weekend.[10][11] The film made $15.2 million on its first day, which included $5.6 million in advance screenings in the week leading up to its release, with $4.1 million coming from Thursday previews.[113] It went on to debut to $37.2 million, topping the box office; 61% of the opening weekend audience was male and 63% was between 18 and 34 years old.[114] The film made $13.9 million in its second weekend (a drop of 62%), finishing in third.[115] In its third weekend, the film grossed $7.5 million, a decline of 46% from the previous weekend.[116] Kayleena Pierce-Bohen of Screen Rant called the film a "box office bomb" and said that the film's disappointing profits were due to poor marketing of the film, tough competition with The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and the fans boycotting the companies Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro.[117]
Outside of the US and Canada, the film grossed $33 million from 60 markets in its first weekend.[118] In its second weekend, Honor Among Thieves grossed $15.5 million, for a drop of 45%.[119] The film earned another $13.8 million from 64 markets in its third weekend.[120]
Critical response
edit
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 91% of 314 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "An infectiously good-spirited comedy with a solid emotional core, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves offers fun fantasy and adventure even if you don't know your HP from your OP."[121] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[122] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 90% positive score, with 77% saying they would definitely recommend it.[114]
Nicholas Barber, for BBC, stated that "fantasy adventures might be getting ever more gloomy and portentous on television, but the producers of Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves have followed the Marvel Studios tactic of hiring comedy directors to make a blockbuster [...]. The film they've made is a feelgood, family-friendly caper, which is not a description you can apply to HBO's House of the Dragon or Amazon's The Rings of Power". Barber commented that Goldstein and Daley went for "a bright, snappy heist movie" instead of "an epic odyssey".[123] Christian Holub, for Entertainment Weekly, highlighted that adapting the Dungeons & Dragons game is different from adapting "novels by J.R.R. Tolkien or George R.R. Martin" as "the goal is to capture an experience rather than a specific story—and Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves delightfully nails the fun of role-playing as fantasy characters with your friends".[124] Rafael Motamayor, for Polygon, commented that the film feels like the "latest session" in a years-long Dungeons & Dragons campaign and that Honor Among Thieves "does a great job of capturing the different tones players might experience in their own campaigns, from horror to campy fun, and from epic high fantasy to a thrilling heist".[125] Linda Codega of Io9 called it a "solid film"—"the comedy is a little rushed, but the jokes all land" and "the characters mostly come together as charming iterations of classic D&D classes".[126] John Kirk at Original Cin wrote that Dungeons & Dragons is a "shared and collaborative storytelling" game where the players via role-playing "respond to a presented setting and antagonists and other characters by the Dungeon Master. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves manages to present all of these aspects so well that you can see the D&D players in the audience actually miming the rolling of dice".[127]
Benjamin Lee, for The Guardian, wrote that "the script does a solid job of making it an accessible world to those not already steeped in it although Goldstein and Daley, writing alongside Michael Gilio, are less effective with the film's many attempts at comedy. It's a shame as the cast are game and Pine and Rodriguez have a fizzy platonic chemistry but it's just never as funny as it should be despite ample set-ups".[128] G. Allen Johnson at the San Francisco Chronicle asserted, "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves feels like Daley and Goldstein, who also co-wrote with Michael Gilio, asked ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI: 'Write a Marvel movie except with Dungeons & Dragons characters.' Seconds later, this spit out."[129] Katie Walsh at the Los Angeles Times opined that "Aside from its clunky title, Dungeon[s] & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves has a relaxed, loose energy that puts the viewer at ease" and "yet there is some ineffable quality lacking—perhaps an emulsifying ingredient—that prevents all these elements (the stars, the lore, the creatures) from coming together into something truly magical. Maybe on the next roll of the 20-sided die."[130] Glen Weldon, for NPR, commented that "the film's plot is purely, ruthlessly episodic—it comes down to a series of fetch quests [...]. But to complain about the number of fetch quests in a D&D film would be like complaining that a movie about Scrabble features too much spelling".[131] Richard Lawson, for Vanity Fair, also highlighted that the film is structured around a series of quests and the "new sidekicks" who are picked up along the way.[132] Lawson wrote that "the film is stuffed with all manner of mythology and moves at frenzied pace, sometimes wobbling in its speed and density but usually regaining control just before things topple into irksome incoherence".[132]
On the cast, Weldon highlighted that Pine's Edgin is "a character who not only rides the razor's edge between charm and smarm but who sets up housekeeping there" and Grant's Forge evokes similar smarm to Grant's character in Paddington 2. He commented that "Rodriguez doesn't get the chance to do a lot that you haven't seen Michelle Rodriguez do before, but she remains great at it" and Page as a paladin "nails the necessary hauteur and supreme confidence while layering them with a guileless sincerity that turns his character into a weapon aimed at Pine's character's every insecurity".[131] Holub highlighted that the cast "seem to be having fun" and "what's especially welcome about the humor in Honor Among Thieves is that it doesn't wink or mock its material; the characters just say funny things and bounce off each other as organically as a real-life friend group".[124] Codega stated that "there's not a poor performance out of the group".[126] However, Johnson felt that characters were "thinly written and predictable" resulting in the actors "playing pleasing versions of themselves. They are merely foreground; it's the green screens behind them that provide the manufactured magic".[129] Multiple critics referred to the character of Xenk as an "NPC" who helped move the plot along.[133][134][135] In terms of visuals, Barber highlighted that neither the architecture nor the clothing are attempting to evoke a specific "historical period" but instead "the designers simply stick in whichever castles and costumes seem cool".[123] Barber was more critical of the film's special effects stating that the CGI "doesn't convince you for a second that the characters are in an actual dungeon or facing an actual dragon".[123] In contrast, Codega praised the blend of practical effects and VFX.[126] Kirk commended the film's CGI stating that "the magic is rich, and the effects do not disappoint".[127] Motamayor also highlighted the unique "portrayal of magic" in the film.[125]

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (Goldstein & Daley, 2023) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Charming Rogue with a Heart (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Edgin is a bard-turned-thief who just wants his daughter back.
    - Standard archetype for heist leaders; elevated by Pine’s charisma but structurally predictable.

  2. Badass Woman with a Big Weapon (Low Risk)
    - Example: Holga smashes enemies with brute strength and little emotional expressiveness.
    - Rodriguez’s presence avoids parody; trope feels archetypal, not reductive.

  3. The Awkward Yet Gifted Mage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Simon struggles with confidence until plot demands he master the Helm.
    - Familiar arc of insecurity-to-mastery but well paced and grounded in party dynamics.

  4. Straight-Laced Paladin as Comic Foil (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Xenk is overly noble, humorously oblivious to irony.
    - Borderline “NPC” functionality; succeeds more as meta-humor than emotional character.

  5. Sarcastic Youngster Outsider (Low Risk)
    - Example: Doric is a socially prickly shapeshifter who joins begrudgingly.
    - Refreshes the trope with grounded motivations (anti-deforestation, personal ethics).

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. Assemble the Crew (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Recruiting a team for a heist, each with one key skill.
    - Works in context of genre blending (heist/fantasy) but follows familiar narrative rhythm.

  7. Fetch Quest Structure (Low Risk)
    - Example: Multiple mini-quests (graveyard, dragon lair, magical relic) drive the plot.
    - Mirrors D&D campaigns faithfully; structurally generic but thematically coherent.

  8. Villain’s Betrayal Twist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Forge frames Edgin, then plots a grand undead ceremony.
    - Standard genre double-cross; Grant’s camp performance adds some unpredictability.

  9. Magical McGuffin with One Use (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Tablet of Reawakening can bring back one person.
    - Drives emotional payoff, but its rules are narratively convenient and unexplored.

  10. The Wrong Person Dies (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Holga dies just as the party wins.
    - Setup for the ultimate character sacrifice reversal via McGuffin; sincere, but familiar.

  11. Redemption via Family Realization (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Edgin realizes he was chasing his wife’s memory for selfish reasons.
    - Plays well emotionally but fits standard Disney-fied self-awareness redemption arcs.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  12. Heist Cutaway Planning (Low Risk)
    - Example: Visual flash-forwards of plan execution, then plan fails mid-sequence.
    - Clever in execution and genre-fit; recognizable but delightfully handled.

  13. Crowd Distraction with Flying Riches (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Riches scattered from balloon to save townsfolk from spell.
    - Feel-good payoff device reused from countless Robin Hood/Aladdin variants.

  14. Arena Escape Sequence (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Gladiator-style games used as trap before daring escape.
    - Entertaining, but matches genre conventions for "bait and switch" tension.

  15. Large CGI Creature as Boss Fight (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Chubby red dragon Themberchaud and undead-horde finale.
    - Spectacle is fun but formulaic; less about stakes, more about visuals.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  16. Magic Wears Off at Convenient Time (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Simon fails repeatedly with the Helm—until he doesn't.
    - Character arc-compatible but uses selective success timing for plot convenience.

  17. The Villain Who Monologues (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sofina explains the undead plot while preparing mass mind control.
    - Baked into the D&D tone—less Bond-villain, more fantasy-overexposition.

  18. “NPC” Ally with Plot-Critical Guidance (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Xenk Yendar appears, guides the team, then disappears.
    - Plays on D&D structure, but limits his agency outside of quest function.

  19. One Last Look at the Fallen Comrade (Low Risk)
    - Example: Edgin’s farewell to Holga before resurrecting her.
    - Classic emotional beat—handled with warmth, not melodrama.

  20. Post-Mission Public Acclaim (Low Risk)
    - Example: The group is declared “Heroes of the Realm.”
    - Conventional but earned; narrative closure is celebratory rather than subversive.

A film adaptation of the comics was proposed following the release of the first volume, and Wright was attached to the project early in development. Filming began in March 2009 in Toronto and wrapped that August. The film uses famous features of its Toronto setting and matches the style of video game and comic book imagery. It used real musical artists, including Beck and Metric, as a basis for each fictional group in the battle of the bands plot, with some of the actors also performing. A combination of digital and physical methods were used to create the extensive VFX.
The film premiered after a panel discussion at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2010, and received a wide release in North America on August 13. It was re-released for its 10th anniversary in the United Kingdom on August 21, 2020, and the United States on April 30, 2021. Although it was a box-office bomb that failed to recoup its $85 million production budget, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World received positive reviews from critics, who noted its visual style and humor, and garnered a cult following. The film has made several top ten lists and received over 70 awards and nominations. In scholarly analysis, it has been widely discussed as a transmedia narrative. Another adaptation, the 2023 animated television series Scott Pilgrim Takes Off co-created by O'Malley, saw the entire film cast reprise their roles, with Wright, co-writer Michael Bacall and producers Nira Park and Marc Platt returning as executive producers.
Plot
edit
In Toronto, Scott Pilgrim, a 22-year-old bass player for unsuccessful indie garage band Sex Bob-Omb, is dating Knives Chau, a 17-year-old high-school student, much to the disapproval of his friends in the band, his roommate Wallace Wells, and his younger sister Stacey Pilgrim. Scott meets Ramona Flowers, an American Amazon delivery girl, after having first seen her in a dream. Scott loses interest in Knives but does not break up with her before pursuing Ramona. When Sex Bob-Omb plays in a battle of the bands sponsored by record executive Gideon Graves, Scott is attacked by Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel. Scott defeats Patel and learns that he must defeat her remaining six evil exes in order to date Ramona.
Scott finally breaks up with Knives, who blames Ramona and swears to win him back, by becoming more like Ramona. Scott defeats the next three of Ramona's exes: Hollywood actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee, super-powered vegan Todd Ingram, and lesbian ninja Roxy Richter, while also confronting his own ex, pop star Envy Adams. Scott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding Ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him.
At the next battle of the bands, Sex Bob-Omb defeats Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, twins Kyle and Ken Katayanagi, earning Scott an extra life. Despite this, Ramona appears to get back with her seventh and final evil ex, Gideon. Sex Bob-Omb accepts Gideon's record deal, except for Scott, who quits the band in protest. Gideon invites Scott to his venue, the Chaos Theater, where Sex Bob-Omb is playing. Resolving to win Ramona back, Scott challenges Gideon to a fight for her affection, earning the "Power of Love" sword.
Knives interrupts the battle, attacking Ramona, and Scott is forced to reveal that he cheated on both of them. Gideon kills Scott, and Ramona visits him in limbo to reveal that Gideon has implanted her with a mind control device. Scott uses his 1-up to come back to life and re-enters the Chaos Theatre. He makes peace with his friends and challenges Gideon, this time for himself, gaining the "Power of Self-Respect" sword. After apologizing to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them and accepting his own faults, Scott joins forces with Knives and they defeat Gideon. Now free from Gideon's control, Ramona prepares to leave. Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over and, at her encouragement, he leaves with Ramona to "try again".
Cast
Production
edit
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was an international co-production between several companies: Marc Platt Productions and Closed On Mondays Entertainment (United States), Big Talk Films (United Kingdom), and Dentsu (Japan).[5]
Development
edit


Edgar Wright and Bryan Lee O'Malley at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. In his chapter on the comic in Icons of the American Comic Book, Dave Wallace wrote that "Wright was the perfect choice to helm the Scott Pilgrim movie, given his experiences of directing British sitcom Spaced. Like Scott Pilgrim, the characters of Spaced viewed the world through a filter that aggregated various elements of pop culture".[6]
After artist Bryan Lee O'Malley completed the first volume of Scott Pilgrim, his publisher Oni Press contacted producer Marc Platt to propose a film adaptation.[7] O'Malley originally had mixed feelings about a film adaptation, stating that he "expected them to turn it into a full-on action comedy with some actor that [he] hated", though he also "didn't even care", admitting: "I was a starving artist, and I was like, 'Please, just give me some money.'"[8] Universal Studios contracted director Edgar Wright, who had just finished the 2004-released Shaun of the Dead and agreed to adapt the Scott Pilgrim comics.[7][9] Wright had first become interested in making the film when given a pre-release copy of the first graphic novel during the Shaun of the Dead press tour,[10] later saying that "everything that [he] found interesting about the book, and why it felt fresh and unique, was irresistible to adapt."[11] In May 2005, the studio signed Michael Bacall to co-write the screenplay.[9]
Wright cited Mario Bava's 1968 film Danger: Diabolik (another adaptation of a comic series) as an influence on his approach to Scott Pilgrim, stating that he took an "Italian influence, a sense of completely unbridled imagination. They don't make any attempt to make it look realistic. Mario Bava's composition and staging has a real try-anything attitude."[12] Other influences on the screenwriters include musical films like Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Dig!, and particularly Phantom of the Paradise.[13] The film also takes on elements of style from the graphic novels, including the use of comic book text-as-graphic (e.g. sound effect onomatopoeia), which is described by Wright and O'Malley as "merely the internal perspective of how Scott understands himself and the world".[14] It has been described as both a video game and a comic book film.[15]
Bacall said that he wanted to write the Scott Pilgrim film because he felt strongly about its story and empathized with its characters.[16] Wright said that O'Malley was "very involved" with the script of the film from the start, contributing lines and adding polish. Due to the long development, several lines from various scripts written by Wright and Bacall were used in later Scott Pilgrim comics.[17] The screenplay's second draft, which O'Malley said "became the main draft for the film", was submitted right at midnight on the night the Writers' Strike was supposed to begin in October 2007.[18] No material from Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour, the sixth Scott Pilgrim volume, appeared in the film, as the comic was not complete at the time of the film's production; O'Malley contributed suggestions for the film's ending and gave the producers his notes for the sixth volume,[19] but stated that the film's ending was "their ending".[20] Some ideas for the film's ending were cut before production, including that Scott would turn out to be a serial killer who fantasized the gaming aspects[21] and that Gideon would turn into a Transformers-style robot.[22]
Casting of the principal characters began in June 2008, with Wright consulting with O'Malley during casting.[23] Test shoots began in July 2008, with Wright saying that there was a year of preparation before shooting began. He also stopped working on his Ant-Man screenplay for two years during the production of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.[11] By 2009, casting had been completed and the film was titled Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.[24] The cast spent two months in fight training together before filming, with Bradley James Allan and Peng Zhang of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team;[11][25] Michael Cera said that he "got kicked in the throat during the training" and "expected it to be excruciating, but it didn't hurt at all, which was really confusing."[10] Principal photography began in March 2009 in Toronto,[26][27] and wrapped as scheduled in August.[23][28]

In the film's original ending, written before the release of the final Scott Pilgrim book, Scott gets back together with Knives.[29] O'Malley objected to the first ending because he felt it would dilute Knives's character.[30] After the final book in the series, in which Scott and Ramona get back together, was released, and with divided audience reaction to the film's original ending, a new ending was filmed to match the books, with Scott and Ramona getting back together.[29] O'Malley helped write the new ending and Wright called Knives' actress Ellen Wong beforehand, thinking she might be disappointed at the change but finding that she liked the idea.[31] The final ending was shot three months before the film was released;[14] Wright says that it is his "preferred ending".[22] The film was given a production budget of $85–90 million, an amount offset by tax rebates that resulted in a final cost of around $60 million.[32] Universal fronted $60 million of the pre-rebate budget.[33] O'Malley's commentary track was recorded on August 14, 2010, one day after the film's theatrical release.[34]
Setting

One of the producers, Miles Dale, said that the film is "the biggest movie ever identifiably set in Toronto."[36] The film features notable Toronto locations Casa Loma, St. Michael's College School, Sonic Boom, the Toronto Public Library Wychwood Library, a Goodwill location on St. Clair West, a Second Cup, a Pizza Pizza, Lee's Palace, and Artscape Wychwood Barns.[35][36][37] The production planned to set the film in Toronto because, in Dale's words, "the books are super-specific in their local details" and director Wright wanted to use the imagery from the books, so Universal Studios had no plans to alter the setting.[36] Dale stated that "Bathurst Street is practically the cerebral cortex of Scott Pilgrim".[36] David Fleischer of Torontoist wrote that though films set in New York City show off all the major landmarks, "Scott Pilgrim revels in the simplicity" of everyday locations that are still identifiably Toronto, like the Bathurst/Bloor intersection and a single Pizza Pizza restaurant.[37]
Director Wright, who lived in the city for a year before making the film, said that "as a British filmmaker making [his] first film outside the UK, [he] wouldn't want anyone to give [him] demerits for getting the location wrong", sticking to the real Toronto and "shooting even the most banal of locations" in the comic.[37] Wright said that the first thing he did when he arrived in Toronto was to tour all of the locations with O'Malley, saying that this gave him a "kind of touch down at the real locations [that] just made everything feel right", though O'Malley could not remember the exact spots of some and so they drove around using his comic reference photos to find them.[37] The production was allowed to film in Second Cup and Pizza Pizza locations, with Wright saying that using them instead of Starbucks "just felt right" because "it means something to Canadian audiences and people in international audiences just think [they] made [Pizza Pizza] up [them]selves. It sounds like a cute movie brand".[37]
Wright said that he took pride in having been able to record the original Lee's Palace mural before it was taken down; he also had the old bar reconstructed on a set for interior scenes, which was positively received when the bands consulting for the film visited. Wright suggested that "they wanted it preserved as a museum piece".[37] Another reconstruction was the Rock It club, which no longer existed, with the interior built on a sound stage.[37] The Sonic Boom store had been changed from how it appeared in the comics, but allowed its interior to be fully restored to the previous look for filming.[35][37] The backgrounds were also changed for the film: many landscapes were simplified in post-production to emulate the drawing style in the comics, including removing many trees from the scenes shot at Hillcrest Park and Turner Road.[37]
Casa Loma has served as a movie set for many different productions, and so appearing in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World as itself being a movie set was described as "very trippy".[37] The scene at Casa Loma also shows the CN Tower and Baldwin Steps, with Don McKellar (who played the director in the scene) reporting that "people were going crazy" at opening night in Toronto when it played.[37] The Casa Loma fight is in the original comic book, but the moment when Scott Pilgrim is pushed through a matte painting generic cityscape to reveal the CN Tower was only added for the film. In his chapter, '"Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together": The Cultural Crossovers of Bryan Lee O'Malley', Mark Berninger calls this reveal "an ironic reference to the specific filmic location" and says that it is "entirely in line with O'Malley's use of metafictional commentary to stress transnational hybridity precisely by highlighting Canadian identity".[38]
Casting
edit
Wright also has an incredible eye for casting, filling his film with people who could, and often soon would, be superheroes. To give you an idea of how appropriately superheroic this lot are, the line-up includes the once or future Superman, Captain America, Captain Marvel, LEGO Robin, Royal Pain, Human Torch, Punisher, and The Atom.
– Helen O'Hara, The Ultimate Superhero Movie Guide (2020) pp.74–75[39]
Casting took place between 2008 and 2010,[23][24] involving director Wright and casting directors Jennifer Euston, Allison Jones, and Robin D. Cook.[40] Cera was cast in March 2008[41] and Winstead in May.[42] By the end of 2008, Whitman, Wong, and Kendrick were cast; in January 2009, Routh, Evans, and Larson were announced together, with Webber, Pill, Simmons, and Bhabha added around the same time.[43] Extras casting in Toronto began in February 2009.[44] Though based on a graphic novel about a musician, experts and reviewers consider the film to be a comic book adaptation and a superhero film, and in the years after its release commenters noted that the film features an all-star cast of the biggest actors in comic book and superhero films,[39][45][46] with CBR's Noah Dominguez saying that "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may have the best of comic book movie actors, ever".[45] Patrick O'Donnell of NME wrote that "notable actors [having starred] in comic book adaptations before and after their roles in Scott Pilgrim [injects] a meta quality to the film's already genre-busting style".[47]
Director Wright felt confident with his casting in the film, saying that "like with Hot Fuzz [when they] had great people in every single tiny part, it's the same with this. What's great with this is that there's people [like] Michael [Cera] and Jason [Schwartzman], and [...] people who are up and coming, like Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Brie Larson, and then there's complete unknowns as well".[48] Collider noted that the less-known actors fit their roles well, with Wright confirming that they did not have much pressure to find a lot of big names, adding that "Universal never really gave [him] any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael [Cera] has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and also a lot of the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are."[48] He also noted that while some of the actors were more famous when they auditioned, like Schwartzman and Evans, others became more well-known over the time the film was in development, saying that "Anna Kendrick did her first audition for it before she shot the first Twilight. And Aubrey Plaza got the part in Scott Pilgrim before she did Funny People or Parks and Recreation, which is crazy. It shows you how long this film has taken to get made."[10]
The casting decisions were all run by O'Malley during a casting session with Wright;[19] O'Malley was not in the room but was shown all of the tapes.[18] Wright said that he planned on casting Cera while he was writing Hot Fuzz, after watching episodes of Arrested Development,[48] also saying that he needed an actor that "audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass."[49] Cera said he was equally excited to work with Wright, "because [he] was a big fan of his".[10] He committed to working out for fight scenes for a year in preparation, earning him the on-set nickname "push-up king" because of how muscular he became.[50] Wright explained that though Cera is a talented musician, they were not particularly looking for people who could already play instruments, with the cast members who could not subsequently learning for the film.[48] Like Cera, Wright already had in mind Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his choice for Ramona Flowers, thinking of her for the part two years before filming had started because "she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded".[51] In 2020, Wright and Winstead explained how she had been his first choice after he saw her in Death Proof and because she has big eyes that reflected the graphic novel. Wright said that Universal had suggested Seth Rogen for the role of Scott, as his recent film Knocked Up had been successful, but Wright could not see anyone but Cera in the role.[52]
Ellen Wong, a little-known Toronto actress,[23] auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition, Wright learned that Wong has a green belt in taekwondo, and says he found himself intrigued by this "sweet-faced young lady being a secret badass".[51] In the 2020 retrospective by Entertainment Weekly, Wong said she did not think she would even be considered for the role because she is Asian, while Chris Evans said that he was approached by Wright about a role in the film and felt that "it was a no-brainer [because he] was such a big fan of" the director, taking the role of Lucas Lee.[52] Other actors considered for Lucas were Evans' future Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star Sebastian Stan[40] and Twilight's Robert Pattinson.[53] The actors playing Lucas's stunt doubles are the actual stunt doubles for Evans.[54] Aubrey Plaza, who has a supporting role as Julie Powers, said that "there's a lot of weird, perfectly casted people", citing Michael Cera and Alison Pill as particularly matching their characters.[55] Other candidates for Pill's role of Kim were Betty Gilpin, Zoe Kazan, and Rooney Mara.[40] As well as Plaza, other members of the cast and crew expressed similar sentiments: Kieran Culkin explained that he was sent a script to audition without a character name, but when he saw the description of Wallace he knew the role was for him, and Wright said that the audition of then-18-year-old Brie Larson "blew everybody else away", adding: "[executive producer] Jared [LeBoff] and I both said afterward, 'We've got to cast her'."[52]
Wright says one thing he is particularly happy with is that this film, unlike many comedies including his own, has "a lot of funny women in it", recalling a particular scene he dubbed "the funny lady relay race", because it "starts with Anna Kendrick, then switches to Aubrey Plaza, then switches to Mary [Elizabeth Winstead], then switches to Brie Larson, and it's just Michael [Cera] being attacked from all sides from all the different women in the film."[48] In June 2013, O'Malley, who is of Korean and white Canadian parentage, stated that he regretted the fact that the film's cast was predominantly white, and that there were not enough roles for minorities.[56]
The cast of the film reprised their roles for the 2023 Netflix animated series Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.[57]
Music
edit

The film is not only physically set in Toronto, but also, according to Allan Weiss, culturally and temporally located within "the Annex and Wychwood neighbourhoods [of Toronto] during the David Miller era", the time and place of a very specific music scene that the film "embed[s] [itself] into [...] not only via Scott's fictional band[,] but also by the appearance of such clubs as the now defunct Rockit[, and] the film's indie rock soundtrack"; Weiss asserts that the film "marks the mythologizing of the cool Annex scene, the transformation of Toronto indie rock [...] into the stuff of adventure", as "nearly all of the major events [...] are connected in some way to this music scene."[58]
The soundtrack features contributions by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Beck, Metric, Broken Social Scene, Cornelius, Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and David Campbell.[59][60][61][62][63] O'Malley had written up playlists for each of the comics in the back of the books, introducing Wright to other Canadian bands during development. Building on this, Wright said that the production "tried to [...] find a real band for each of the fictional bands, because usually in music films you have one composer who does everything".[48] Wright and Godrich met with and scouted bands to write for the film for two years.[10] Godrich scored the film, his first film score.[11] Before he became involved with the film, early scripts had the running joke that "you never heard the bands [...] You heard the intro, and then it would cut to the next scene, and somebody would be going, 'Oh my God, that's the best song ever.' That was a joke for a long time", according to Wright.[64]
Webber, Pill, and Simmons, as the members of Sex Bob-omb all had to learn to play their respective instruments and spent time rehearsing as a band with Cera (who already played bass) before filming began.[65] Chris Murphy of the band Sloan was the guitar coach for the actors in the film.[48] The actors also sing on the film's soundtrack.[66] Beck wrote and composed the music played by Sex Bob-omb in the film.[67] The songs took two days to write and record, with Beck saying that "it needed to be underthought, [...] they had to be funny, but [he] also wanted them to sound raw, like demos."[68] Brian LeBarton plays drums and bass for the band on the film's score and soundtrack. Two unreleased songs can also be heard in the teaser trailer.[67]
Brendan Canning and Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene wrote all the songs for Crash and the Boys. The tracks were sung by Erik Knudsen, who plays Crash in the film. Drew stated the reason behind this was that "[he] knew that [Knudsen] didn't need to be a singer to pull [it] off" because the songs were "so quick and punk and fast" and "it needed to be the character's voice."[69]

Metric is the inspiration for the film's band The Clash at Demonhead and contributed the song "Black Sheep" to the film,[70] by request of Godrich.[71] The clothing, performance and style of Metric's lead singer, Emily Haines, is also the basis for the lead singer of The Clash at Demonhead, Envy Adams.[70][72] Brie Larson, who portrays Envy Adams, said that she "had no idea [her] body could move that way" when talking at the UK premiere about her stage performance of the song.[73] The music journalist Janelle Sheetz wrote that "Larson's performance is similar enough to [Haines's] but with an attitude appropriate for [Envy Adams]".[74] Envy Adams' film fashion also reverse-influenced the comics: the last graphic novel was in development while the film was being made, and O'Malley said that, though he "would try and distance [him]self from [the actors' interpretations]", he also "gave Envy Adams one of Brie Larson's actual outfits" in the comic.[18]
Larson as Envy Adams provides the vocals for "Black Sheep" in the film, while the soundtrack features a version of the song with Haines as lead singer,[75] per the band's request;[76] Larson was a professional singer and has performed in some of her other films.[77] Metric had been performing the song at their concerts since 2007, but had not released it before the film.[78] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times said that "Envy is a caricature of Haines" and likewise, according to Haines, that "'Black Sheep' is essentially a caricature of Metric", like a song emulating their most distinct aspects.[64] Godrich agreed, and added that it "was perfect for this film [because] it's not Metric. It's a shadow of Metric."[64] Routh, who plays The Clash at Demonhead's bass player Todd Ingram, said "[he] can play ["Black Sheep"] really well", but the film did not use his instrumental, only Larson's vocals over Metric,[11] who had re-recorded the track to make it more sinister.[64] Routh spent "three or four months" learning to play bass for the film.[11]
The song performed by Matthew Patel was written by Dan the Automator and performed by Satya Bhabha in the film. Bhabha said that they "[recorded] it at Capitol Records Studio 2, which is where Frank Sinatra recorded a lot of his stuff. And there was Ray Charles' piano in the room", explaining that the musical history helped him to finish the recording.[11]
Wright said that the film's tonal changes in line with representing the different book parts, and for its fight scenes, were treated like a musical film, saying:[48]
We thought it should play out like a musical in a way in terms of the fights are not dissimilar to the songs. I always thought there were a lot of martial arts films that were like musicals, so we wanted to take that further. Ya know, in a Gene Kelly film when he performs an amazing routine, at the end of the scene no one goes, 'Oh my god, that was fucking amazing!' The song is about something, and then there might be some dialogue at the end that is also about that theme. And that's kind of how this works where people have these huge fights – and it's kind of like how it is in the books – where everything goes back to normal, and there's a little reaction to what just happened, but there's no sort of mourn the dead.
He also said that some music videos were made of song performances, including some of Sex Bob-omb and the sole The Clash at Demonhead performance, shooting the entire song even though they would not be used in complete form in the film; he said they were so good he wanted to get them all recorded so they had it.[48] The Blu-ray home release includes special features, with music videos of the complete performances of Sex Bob-omb's "Garbage Truck", "Threshold", and "Summertime", and The Clash at Demonhead's "Black Sheep".[79] The music video of "Black Sheep" had also been included as a bonus feature with the soundtrack pre-order on iTunes.[80]
Music from the Legend of Zelda video game series is used to open the film, in sound effects,[81] and in a dream sequence. To get permission to use the music, Edgar Wright sent a clip of the film and wrote a letter to Nintendo of America that described the music as "like nursery rhymes to a generation".[49] There are other sound effects and clips from other video games used in the film.[81][82] Zeitlin Wu writes that the film pushes the graphic novel's video game elements to the limit by being able to include such sound effects.[15]
Visual effects
edit
The film is described as having an "inimitable look" of manga and video game (particularly 16-bit) iconography with bright colors and graphics mixed into the live action; visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill described the look as "tricky" to achieve, calling the film's style and appeal "very high-tech images with a very low-fi feel".[83] Churchill was interviewed by MTV in August 2010 about the effects in the film. He noted that some of the work was more complex because of a shooting ethic of Wright's: that there should be a physical representation of any post-production effects, saying that "whenever the image flashes in the finished shots – every punch, sword clash or something – those were actually flashes [...] on-set with photo flashbulbs [...] and then [they] add [...] flash with CG. When someone dies and bursts into coins, [they would] empty buckets of silver Mylar so the actors had something to react to."[83]
Churchill described the first fight (Scott vs. Matthew Patel) as "the most challenging".[83] He says this was because of the technical elements involved, like the computer-generated Bollywood dance and requiring blue screen work, matte painting and many stunts. The scene also incorporates the video game scrolling background effect, which was filmed by a second unit over a full day. Churchill added that one moment in particular required much work: "When Scott jumps off the stage into that manga-esque vortex, that's made up of motion picture photography done on-set, digital still photography, and graphics and speed lines drawn by hand from what [Oscar Wright] gave us".[83] Storyboard artist Oscar Wright (also brother of director Edgar Wright) noted that the introduction of Patel was used "to convey the kind of energy [they] wanted, and explore how [they] would introduce the 2D graphic elements".[84]
The third fight (Scott vs. Todd Ingram) had to be adapted from the comic material more creatively, as Todd's superpowers are shown in print by rings, which was handled by the VFX team. Churchill explains that they took inspiration from the old RKO Pictures logo of a transmitting tower. To imitate this they "made the rings feel uneven and have these optical aberrations with color bursts".[83] In this fight, Scott also gets punched through several walls, which was achieved with camera set-ups. The movement away from Todd is shown from tight and wide camera shots, with Cera as Scott being pulled on a rig in the room. The image of Cera was then merged with a digital Scott and a stunt double, who do go through walls.[83]
The disappearing superpower used by Roxy in the film was achieved by a blue screen, with actress Whitman being digitally erased, but there was white smoke and flashbulbs used on the set to mark the appearances. Black smoke was added in digitally, while lens flares were done manually by "just flashing different lights at the camera" for a day to create material.[83] Roxy appears in the fourth fight, where she uses a bladed weapon. Churchill says that Whitman learned how to ribbon dance and used a pink ribbon in the choreography, which was digitally replaced with the weapon.[83]
 
Some of the storyboard for the Scott vs. the Katayanagi Twins fight
A new piece of software was written to produce elements of the fifth fight (Scott vs. the Katayanagi Twins); Andrew Whitehurst developed what Churchill called the "Wave Form Generator", and the visual effects team worked with music producer Godrich so they could transform different elements of the music into animations and create visual music.[83] Churchill explained that "the software would convert these sound stems into animation data, so when the band is playing, the graphics and the dragons are moving in time with the music."[83] This fight was storyboarded by Oscar Wright without any comic reference as the film overtook the publication of the books.[84] The 'audio demons', fighting monsters powered by the music in the film, were then created on-set by Churchill using weather balloons.[83]
For the climax fight against Gideon, a pyramid tower resembling one from Super Mario Bros. was filmed on for a week, with Churchill saying it often got hot due to the light effects being used, including the flashbulbs and red lights to represent fire on Scott's sword. The scene also used blue screen and many stunt performers. Oscar Wright storyboarded the entire sequence except for Gideon's glitching at the end, which Edgar Wright thought of during editing and was created entirely in post-production.[83] Edgar Wright also noted that the pyramid tower fight scene was the slowest piece he had ever filmed, saying: "So we were raring along at this amazing pace. And then there was this final set piece on a pyramid. Suddenly, we slowed down to doing ten shots in a day, which is very slow for me. I sat there on top of this pyramid, looking down at these enormous platforms being maneuvered around and I thought, '[Whose] idea was this?' And it was mine!"[10]
Before directing fight scenes with visual effects, Wright consulted with director friends with more experience, including Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, and Sam Raimi.[10]
Title sequence
edit
 
Frames from the title sequence
The opening title sequence was designed by Richard Kenworthy of Shynola, and was inspired by drawn-on-film animation. The sequence also begins with an 8-bit version of the Universal title slate and music, which Art of the Title calls the film's "amuse-bouche" and which was designed by Oscar Wright.[15][84]
Oscar Wright says the 8-bit Universal logo idea was an early decision in production, and that he treated it "like some crappy low-res, low frame-rate FMV you might find at the start of some of those games" from the start.[84] Creating the title slate involved separating the letters of 'Universal' and making them appear pixelated, using a matching spinning globe graphic by film animators VooDooDog, and reducing the frame rate to four seconds (rather than one) so that it appeared "steppy"; an 8-bit version of the accompanying music was also added, which Oscar Wright said "really seals the deal".[84]
Edgar Wright got the idea to have the sequence from Quentin Tarantino after screening an early cut of the film for him. Tarantino told him that the film "needed a title sequence at the start to let people settle in and hint more about what we were about to see".[85] The original opening sequence had the film's title shown over the long living room band shot that comes before the title sequence, which Edgar Wright said was one of the first scenes to be storyboarded, with the cast credits at the end of the film.[84] After an early mockup of the title sequence on AVID, they approached Shynola to create it,[85] as the film's graphic artists (Oscar Wright and Double Negative) were too occupied with the other effects in the film at this point in production and Edgar Wright was familiar with their work.[84]
The AVID animatic, a black-and-white sketch animation with waveform graphics, was described by Edgar Wright as already "giving the film more of a sense of occasion and a very distinct break between the prologue and the first scene that moves the story forward".[84] At this stage, they had also chosen Beck's "loudest soundtrack song" to play over the title sequence.[84]
Kenworthy spoke of his references for the design:[84]
You can't study animation and not be well-versed in Len Lye, Oskar Fischinger, Stan Brakhage, and Norman McLaren. We went back and re-watched those films and they were still full of life. We got excited about projecting such vivid imagery on the big screen, in front of an audience who most likely hadn't experienced that work.
Shynola was also given a selection of references from Edgar Wright, who described the brief as "2001 meets Sesame Street" and showed them the title sequence of Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, which used drawn-on optical tracks.[84] As with traditional drawn-on-film animation, Kenworthy traced and painted the images.[84] Wright provided musical references as well, saying that they "wanted to visualize the music and have every graphic, symbol, and subliminal image in time with the music — a hypnotic barrage of colour, light, and music. The idea was to have it as if the animation is a manifestation of how cool the music is in Knives' head. That's why [they] end the sequence on her watching, the titles are like her brain is exploding with how cool the track is."[84]
The brief also requested that the opening sequence not use any of the comic artwork, to not spoil the film, so Kenworthy pitched "an 8-bit epileptic eye-fight" and created a mood film using geometric patterns and visual effects from manga; Edgar Wright requested that it should have less overt video game references.[84] Shynola then worked with the music concept, Kenworthy saying that they "hit on making a visual representation of [Sex Bob-omb's] slightly amateurish, raw, garage-y sound. Something that had the feel of a live performance. A lively, colourful, in-your-face scratch film seemed a perfect fit."[84] Working with Edgar Wright more, they chose to have a visual representation of each character and to scratch the appropriate number of 'X' marks for the actors who played each of the evil exes.[84]
As the film was nearing completion, Shynola had a short time frame to finish the title sequence, so they worked on syncing the sequence and the music digitally at first, visualizing final adjustments before scratching onto sheets of acetate film. From each sheet of acetate, one second of footage was produced.[84] Kenworthy said that after producing the images, they would "deliberately kick [each sheet] around the floor a bit to pick up a lot of dirt, scratches, and hairs".[84]
Printing the sequence involved putting each sheet into a high resolution negative scanner and cutting it down into individual frames before printing onto 35 mm movie film. There was also difficulty with the color printing, with most of the colors they wanted to use being "illegal".[84] During the printing process, Kenworthy added parts of a scratch film he had made at college, which had been used when scanning to check color accuracy.[84]
ComicsAlliance calls the title sequence "just the first in a memorable series of seamless mash-ups of graphics, film and animation that beautifully translate the spirit of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novels to the screen".[86] Art of the Title describes the sequence as "visual napalm",[84] with Bleeding Cool saying it is "quite wonderful".[87] Jade Budowski of Decider writes that "with its rapid-fire introductory scene and the ensuing vibrant animated title sequence, [the film] wastes no time in sucking you into [its] world".[88]
Easter eggs
edit
The film includes several easter eggs alluding to the comics or for foreshadowing. Fleischer noted that though the comic and film have Scott and Wallace's apartment at 65A Albert Avenue (filmed at 65 Alberta Avenue), there is a reference to O'Malley's own old apartment at 27 Alberta Avenue as the address on the Amazon delivery slip Scott signs.[37] Fleischer also points out the blinking 'L' on a Flight Centre sign on Manning Avenue, which he writes is a warning that a fight is about to happen.[37] Wright said, before the film came out, that a t-shirt of Plumtree, the band that originated the name 'Scott Pilgrim', would feature in the film.[48] Other t-shirts Scott wears include one for The Smashing Pumpkins, a band sharing his initials;[82] one with the bass guitar logo from the Rock Band game series;[89] and one that references Fantastic Four, which he wears after defeating Lucas, played by Evans, who at the time was best known for his role as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies.[81] Scott's changing t-shirts often match Ramona's changing hair color throughout the film.[82]
There are also references to other media, particularly gaming and comics, with Den of Geek's James Hunt compiling a list of several, including Scott's X-Men patch seen as he rips it from his coat; the Legend of Zelda Triforce represented by Gideon's initials in the film and title sequence (shown above) and the Dark Link-inspired Nega-Scott; Envy's band being named after the 1990 game The Clash at Demonhead (as well as The Clash); Kim dressing in Japanese Gothic Lolita fashion for the final battle as a point of humor; the scene that was shot, performed, and edited entirely like a Seinfeld episode; and using the "this is a league game" line from The Big Lebowski.[81] /Film notes that slow-motion broken glass falling and reflecting Ramona and Roxy as they fight resembles the character selection screen of Street Fighter, and that the Chaos Theater and Sex Bob-omb's forced labor is a reference to EarthBound.[90]
Like The Clash at Demonhead, the other band names reference video games: Sex Bob-omb to the Bob-ombs in Mario franchise games, and Crash and the Boys to a game called Crash 'n' the Boys: Street Challenge. According to actress Larson, The Clash at Demonhead was the first game that comic author O'Malley ever had.[82]
Scott playing the bassline of what he calls "Final Fantasy II" is also considered an easter egg; he plays the bassline from the game Final Fantasy IV, but this game was released as Final Fantasy II outside of Japan in the 1990s because the second and third installments had not been released internationally at the time.[82]
In her adaptation discussion, Zeitlin Wu notes that in the graphic novel, the fourth fight (Scott vs. Roxy Richter) was a frame-for-frame recreation of the introduction to Ninja Gaiden, and in the film, this same frame-for-frame remake is used as the introduction of the final fight against Gideon.[15]
Release
Analysis
edit
Transmedia storytelling is essentially delivering a narrative using a blend of different creative techniques. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World throws in little details of unrealistic sounds, imagery, and on-screen captions. These wouldn't work in just any movie, including other comic adaptations. These additions are what makes Scott Pilgrim such a true comic book adaptation. Even if you'd never heard of the source material, you'd be able to feel the comic book influences.
– Meghan Hale, Comic Years[46]
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has been widely discussed as invoking a transmedia narrative, using the graphic novel platform, and video game and comic book conventions, within the film.[15][139][140][141] John Bodner explained that "the film becomes an adaptation of a text that is, in many ways, itself a cultural adaptation calling attention to its own source material in its overt employment of many techniques derived from the aesthetic of comic books".[140] Zeitlin Wu wrote how the film "[pays] homage to comics, video games, and the overlaps between the two", and noted that its process of adaptation is unique in how it has made a comic book movie that is not realistic, staying true to the original form.[15] In his chapter, "Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Texts: Adaptation, Form, and Transmedia Co-creation", Bodner noted several elements that create the film as transmedial, describing its references to the comic book and video game media.[14]
With unconventional use of comic book markers, Wright disrupts the realism and diegesis of the film,[14] destabilizing boundaries of form and "pushing their transmediality to the next level".[15] Bodner, Zeitlin Wu, and Burke noted that Wright, with the film, became one of the only directors since the 1960s to use, in Bodner's words, "the comment box, marks (action lines), and onomatopoeia text as sound effects" in a filmic work, using such techniques both conventionally (labeling time and place) and unconventionally for the medium.[14] Burke described the use as "self-reflexive".[109] Zeitlin Wu said that "unlike the 1960s Batman, the use of visual onomatopoeia in Scott Pilgrim seamlessly merges reality and illusion, which seems apt for a storyline in which the two are indistinguishable", using the comic book words within the film as part of the story rather than alongside it.[15]
Burke wrote further on the use of written sound effects as amplifying meaning, saying that "there are areas in which comics' visualized sound trumps cinema's soundtrack", engaging with Robert C. Harvey to agree that "word and picture can be coupled to reveal the hero's cheery bravado even in the very midst of thundering action".[109] Bodner recognised two scenes ("the first battle of the bands and Lucas Lee's 'grind' down the rail") where Wright uses high-volume noise to recreate the silent form of comic books, as in a film the loudness drowns out any other sound and requires the use of text in the same way that the purely visual comic book form does.[14] Burke also noted the benefit of visual text when a sound would be less or not effective due to "ambient noise" in the film.[109]

An example of spatial remediation in the film to simulate comic book panels, with three simultaneous but not spatially-continuous images shown and framed with black "gutters" (as in Bodner,[14] Zeitlin Wu,[15] and Ferhle.[141])
Bodner gave the film a postmodern reading because of its mixed form,[140] also noting that Wright seems to alter the film form to allow for storytelling executed in a similar way to how story and movement is achieved in static comic book sequences.[14] Zeitlin Wu acknowledged that many of the film's storyboards were taken from the comic panels.[15] Bodner wrote that Wright transcodes the "construction of comic panels" into the film; Wright himself has said that "a lot of people have mentioned [...] how it feel[s] like reading a comic book",[14] a sentiment echoed by Zeitlin Wu.[15] Bodner suggested that this is created by transition techniques – and that the techniques that produce this are Wright's own, building from his work in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz – that work by "replicating [the panel's] companion – the 'gutter'."[14] Wright recreated this element of outside space in comics in the film form by making "cuts that are exceedingly quick or that open into shots that displace conventional temporal logic (anticontinuity editing), or with cuts that utilize a purposefully barely visible wipe effect",[14] and by using "blackouts, which function as brief moments of dead space" between certain frames.[15]
Zeitlin Wu and Bodner both discussed the use of comic book form within the film medium as affecting the viewer's perception of continuity and time, particularly highlighting the dream sequences.[15][14] Zeitlin Wu wrote that, in the first such sequence, "Wright maintains the fragmentation of the comics medium by retaining the divisions between the original panels: the screen fades to black after each frame, an attempt to mimic the simultaneously diachronic and synchronic experience of reading comics".[15] Bodner also discussed the non-naturalistic temporality of the sequence of images when Scott orders a package, writing that they better represent comic panels where temporality can be otherwise deduced by the reader. He added that, as pastiche, this scene serves a dual function to foreshadow the magical realism that will appear.[14]
In his chapter "Tell It Like a Game: Scott Pilgrim and Performative Media Rivalry", Jeff Thoss suggested that the transmedial cues of the film serve best "as a way to illuminate the specific narrative affordances and limitations of comics, films, and computer games".[139] Building on Thoss, Fehrle examined the remediation (Bolter and Grusin) of signifiers of video game as well as other visual media genres and their conspicuousness.[141] He also noted the use of split screen, considering it both a reference to videogame multiplayer modes and 1990s television, and a technique to draw attention to the mediality of film "by making visible the impact of an editor, a role which in the dominant continuity editing system is regarded as one that should be kept hidden".[141][141]
Reception

Critical reception

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 270 critic reviews for the film are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads, "Its script may not be as dazzling as its eye-popping visuals, but Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is fast, funny, and inventive".[142] According to Metacritic, which sampled 38 reviews and calculated an average score of 69 out of 100, the film received a "generally favorable" response.[143] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an "A-" grade on a scale from A to F.[144]
Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a mixed review, referring to it as "an example of attention-deficit filmmaking at both its finest and its most frustrating", saying it was economical with its storytelling and successfully incorporated the many big fight set pieces, but missed opportunities to build Scott and Ramona's relationship.[145] David Edelstein of New York magazine also wrote a mixed review, agreeing that Scott "hardly seems worthy of Winstead's Ramona" and saying he thought that "the parade of super-villain exes [...] is like a forced march; [he] felt [he]'d had [his] fill of the fights and there were still five exes to go".[146] Michael Phillips gave a generally positive review, but did agree that the number of fights holds the film back, writing that "Seven sounds like a lot. It is, in fact, two or three too many."[147] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a largely negative review, finding the film "a discouragingly limp movie in which nothing is at stake. A character can 'die,' then simply rewind video and come back to life. Or change his mind about his true love and then change it again. Scott Pilgrim's battle isn't against the world; it's against an erratic moral compass."[148] Cindy White at IGN gave a positive review, praising Wright and the film's style extensively, though she did mention that "the middle drags a bit and the ending isn't all [she] hoped it would be."[149]
A. O. Scott, who made the film a New York Times "critics pick", also reviewed it positively, suggesting it was "the best video game movie ever".[150] Slant Magazine's Nick Schager also gave the film a positive review, awarding it 3.5 stars out of 4,[151] with colleague Simon Abrams calling it "the most visually exciting, funny, and emotionally involving studio-produced film of the year" and awarding 4 stars out of 5 in his DVD review.[124]


Brie Larson (pictured at the film's UK premiere) and Kieran Culkin (pictured at the San Diego Comic-Con panel) have been described as the film's "scene stealers", while reception to lead Michael Cera was mixed.
Debruge praised the ensemble cast and Wright's directing skills that make each of the many characters distinctive. However, he criticized Cera's performance, saying that "his comic timing is impeccable, [but] he's finally played the wilty wallflower one too many times".[145] Edelstein found the film's biggest issue to be Cera's acting, saying that "a different lead might have kept you laughing and engaged. Cera doesn't come alive in the fight scenes the way Stephen Chow does in [...] surreal martial-arts comedies [like] Kung Fu Hustle",[146] with Honeycutt dissecting the storytelling and determining that "Cera doesn't give a performance that anchors the nonsense" of the film.[148] Conversely, A.O. Scott wrote that "somehow [Cera and Winstead] make it work" in selling the relationship without being a cliché,[150] and Abrams said that the actors had "never looked this good, especially Cera", noting that "[his] performance is knowingly affected and self-absorbed throughout scenes depicting Scott and Knives's awkward dating" as the film deliberately plays up Scott's initial narcissism.[124] Cera's delivery of the particular line "I was thinking we should break up, or whatever" has been reviewed as amusing[146] and awkwardly realistic.[147] White wrote that the actors playing Ramona's exes "all [seem] to be having a blast in their scenes".[149] Brie Larson and Kieran Culkin have been frequently described as the film's scene stealers for their performances as Scott's ex, rock star Envy Adams, and Scott's roommate, the sarcastic Wallace Wells.[10][145][152][153][154][155] Chris Evans and Brandon Routh have also been called scene stealers in some reviews.[156][157][158]
As a negative, Debruge added that "anyone over 25 is likely to find [the film] exhausting, like playing chaperone at a party full of oversexed college kids",[145] remarks echoed by Honeycutt, who called the film "juvenile" and thought "a wider audience among older or international viewers seems unlikely."[148] White gave the film a positive rating of 8/10, saying it is "best suited for the wired generation and those of us who grew up on Nintendo and MTV. Its kinetic nature and quirky sensibilities might be a turnoff for some."[149] Scott also found the youth elements appealing, writing that "there are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren't [but] Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar."[150] Abrams opened his review lamenting that "the sad thing about Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is that people assumed that because it embraced its niche-oriented demographic's interests, in its ad campaign and in its content, that it was destined for cult status and nothing more."[124]
Schager wrote that Edgar Wright is an "inspired mash-up artist, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may be his finest hybridization to date", saying the film has become a "mêlée-heavy video game".[151] Debruge also said that "style [...] becomes the level at which we must appreciate Wright's work", particularly noting the 8-bit Universal logo and the Seinfeld scene.[145] White explains that, though the video game style and structure is non-realistic, "even the most outlandish elements flow naturally from the storytelling".[149] The style was also compared to the comics. According to Phillips, "Edgar Wright understands the appeal of the original Bryan Lee O'Malley graphic novels [...] O'Malley's manga-inspired books combine utter banality with superhero hyperbole, [and] Wright, who is British, has taken it on and won. [The film] lives and breathes the style of the original books, with animated squiggles and hearts and stars filling out the frame in many individual shots."[147] Edelstein opened his review by saying "Yes, this is how you bring a graphic novel to life onscreen!", elaborating that "[Wright takes the] Canadian mangas (in which the mundane meets the superheroic) and concocts a syntax all his own: part comic panel, part arcade video game".[146]
Further comparing the film to the graphic novels, and discussing it as an adaptation, Honeycutt agrees that "Director/producer/co-writer Edgar Wright [...] has successfully reproduced the imagery and worldview of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel, itself a mash-up of ordinary characters lost in a world of manga, video games, music videos and comic book iconography."[148] White writes that the elements of mash-up in the film's style creates "a pop-culture cocktail that is fun, funny and deliciously offbeat", praising Wright for "[making the comic book elements] work in the translation to live action, and [having] enough respect for O'Malley's work in the first place to try to capture that spirit;[149] Scott agrees, saying that the success comes from its ingenuity in bringing the video game to the player's world, rather than the other way around, and so "the line between fantasy and reality is not so much blurred as erased, because the filmmakers create an entirely coherent, perpetually surprising universe".[150] Abrams also notes that some of the comic elements work better in the film, like when Scott wakes up, followed by Wallace and Other Scott, because of the timing of the medium. He opines that Wright also managed to include additional scenes that further inform Scott's characterization and add humor to moments from the comics.[124] Overall, in her 2020 retrospective review, Meghan Hale of Comic Years wrote that "[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World] doesn't just make for an adequate adaptation, but instead brings the story to life in a way that innovates the way we look at adaptations".[46]
Popular response
edit
After seeing the film at a test screening, the American director Kevin Smith said he was impressed by it, and that "it's spellbinding and nobody is going to understand what the fuck just hit them", adding Wright "is bringing a comic book to life".[159] Smith also said that fellow directors Quentin Tarantino and Jason Reitman were "really into it".[159] Carla Gillis, a writer for Now and former lead singer for the band Plumtree, also commented on the film, as her band's song "Scott Pilgrim" was the inspiration for O'Malley to create the series; Gillis felt the film carried the same positive yet bittersweet tone of the song.[160] Several notable video game, film, and anime industry personalities also praised the film after it premiered in Japan, among them Hironobu Sakaguchi, Goichi Suda, Miki Mizuno, Tomohiko Itō and Takao Nakano.[161]
In an editorial for Rotten Tomatoes, Nathan Rabin wrote that the film has a cult following,[162] and in a 2015 Met Film School feature, Danny Kelly listed it as one of the six most underrated films ever, saying it is "a crime" that more people did not go to see it.[163] A 2014 ranking by Den of Geek placed it third on their list of the 25 best underrated comic book films, with James Hunt writing that it "is easily better than any movie on this list. And for that matter, it's better than most movies not on this list"; he suggested it suffered at the box office due to poorly executed marketing and people becoming sick of Michael Cera.[164] In 2020, Evans compared the fans of Scott Pilgrim to those of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying they were just as rabid and dedicated;[52] in February 2020, reviewer Alani Vargas wrote that "it might not be so 'cult' today; if you bring the movie up to anyone now, odds are you'll get a very enthused response to it".[165]
Musical artists were inspired by the film, including Lil Uzi Vert with their albums Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World and Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2,[166] and single "Scott and Ramona".[167][168] The music video for Australian band The Vines' single "Gimme Love" is an homage to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, adopting the visual style of the movie's opening,[169][170] and Kid Cudi sampled dialogue from the film on the song "She Knows This" from his album Man on the Moon III: The Chosen.[171]
Accolades
edit
Main article: List of accolades received by Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has received many awards and nominations. It also made the final shortlist of seven films for nomination in the Best Visual Effects category at the 83rd Academy Awards, but did not receive a nomination.[172] It won the Audience Award at the 2010 Lund International Fantastic Film Festival.[173][174]
The film has been placed on several Top Ten Films of 2010 lists, including as number 1 by Harry Knowles,[175] and on several lists by Empire.[176][177][178][179]
In 2023, Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail named the film as one of the 23 best Canadian comedy films ever made, acknowledging that it was not a Canadian production but writing that "the entire production, though, is just so explicitly Canadian – and so in love with a very specific 'Torontopia' era when it felt like anything was possible – that excluding it from this roundup would be treasonous."[180]

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (Wright, 2010) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Manic Pixie Dream Girl (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ramona Flowers is a mysterious, emotionally distant muse with changing hair and unexplained history.
    - Subverted somewhat by her agency in leaving Gideon and the ending’s introspective tone, but retains core trope DNA.

  2. The Lovable Slacker (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scott Pilgrim is underemployed, emotionally juvenile, and floats between romances without accountability.
    - Cera’s charm and the film’s meta-comedy soften this, but the trope is foundational to his arc.

  3. The Cool Gay Roommate (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Wallace Wells is hyper-witty, sexually confident, and emotionally detached.
    - Iconically played by Culkin but primarily functions as comic relief and plot nudger.

  4. Underwritten Young Love Interest (Low Risk)
    - Example: Knives Chau is loyal, obsessive, and easily manipulated.
    - Her character matures by the end, but her teen infatuation is exaggerated for comic payoff.

  5. Female Villain Played for Kink (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Roxy Richter, Ramona’s ex, is a dominatrix-coded ninja whose defeat is sexualized.
    - Gendered trope not fully interrogated, though wrapped in parody and visual irony.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. Battle for the Girl (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The entire premise revolves around Scott fighting other men for Ramona’s affection.
    - Subverted by the final act’s shift to “Power of Self-Respect,” but core romantic objectification remains.

  7. Expository Dream Girl Appears in a Dream (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scott literally dreams of Ramona before meeting her.
    - Stylized framing emphasizes narrative contrivance; leans into rather than away from cliché.

  8. Evil Exes as Episodic Boss Fights (Low Risk)
    - Example: Seven uniquely styled exes represent escalating narrative obstacles.
    - Intentionally constructed as video game parody; trope is aestheticized rather than emotionally functional.

  9. Final Boss with Mind Control (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Gideon implants Ramona with a chip to control her.
    - Undermines Ramona’s autonomy in the climax, though partially reclaimed afterward.

  10. Redemption Through Self-Realization (Low Risk)
    - Example: Scott re-fights Gideon not for Ramona, but for himself.
    - Standard redemption arc that resolves internal flaw through metaphysical combat metaphor.

  11. The Other Girl Lets Him Go (Low Risk)
    - Example: Knives bows out gracefully, endorsing Scott’s decision to be with Ramona.
    - Clean closure with some emotional payoff, though functionally tidy.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  12. On-Screen Text and Sound Effects (Low Risk)
    - Example: “Thud,” “Pow,” “K.O.,” level-up icons, and visual music synesthesia.
    - Stylistic innovation that transforms clichés into aesthetic function.

  13. Split-Screen for Simultaneous Reactions (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Intercutting domestic scenes with visual punchlines and reaction shots.
    - Stylish but not revolutionary; common in sitcoms and comic-book-inspired media.

  14. Flashy Fight Choreography with Comic Stylization (Low Risk)
    - Example: Over-the-top martial arts scenes mimicking both anime and arcade combat.
    - A knowingly heightened take on a well-worn style; trope-awareness saves it.

  15. Romantic Montage with Musical Underscore (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Music cues that correspond with Scott’s shifting affections.
    - Conventional cue structure beneath aesthetic flair.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  16. Evil Twin/Dark Self Battle (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nega-Scott appears as the final test—then turns out to be friendly.
    - Lampshades the cliché with comedy; a satire more than a sincere plot threat.

  17. Hipster Music as Personality Shortcut (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Band affiliations used to quickly define character alignment and style.
    - Deepens Toronto’s indie scene homage but leans on shorthand for emotional resonance.

  18. "Level Up" as Character Growth Mechanic (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Emotional growth represented by RPG-style score and sword upgrades.
    - Clever but mechanical metaphor risks hollowing emotional beats.

  19. Ex Machina Revive Mechanic (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scott dies and uses his 1-UP to come back stronger.
    - Fits the aesthetic but resolves death consequence-free.

  20. The Girl Is the Prize (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Winning Ramona is framed as the endpoint.
    - Challenged by character self-reflection but still aligns with romantic conquest coding.

Plans for an animated Turtles film with involvement by Rogen began in 2018. In June 2020, the project was officially announced, with Rogen, Goldberg, and James Weaver producing through their company, Point Grey Pictures, and Rowe as director. Seeking to explore the teenage aspect of the Turtles, the filmmakers drew inspiration from teenage coming-of-age films. The animation was provided by Mikros Animation and Cinesite, and was primarily influenced by school notebook sketches. In addition to a score composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the film features various classic East Coast hip-hop songs.
Mutant Mayhem was screened as a work-in-progress at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 12, 2023, and was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on August 2, 2023. It grossed $180.5 million worldwide and received positive reviews for its performances, screenplay, and stylized animation; several critics considered it the best Turtles film. The film received multiple award nominations, including at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards and the Annie Awards. A sequel is set to release in theaters on October 9, 2026, while a follow-up television series, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, debuted on the streaming service Paramount+ in August 2024.
Plot
edit
Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI) executive Cynthia Utrom sends a squad to hunt down rogue scientist Baxter Stockman, who has created a mutagenic ooze with which he intends to form his own mutant animal family, starting with a housefly. Baxter is interrupted by Cynthia's strike force and killed in the resulting explosion, while the mutagen falls into the sewers of New York City. The mutagen turns four turtle brothers—Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael and Donatello—and a rat named Splinter into humanoid mutants, whereupon Splinter adopts the turtles. Splinter distrusts humanity—particularly after one encounter where he and the turtles were chased away—and trains his sons in the art of ninjutsu, instructing them to only leave their sewer home to steal supplies. Over the years, the Turtles long to live with and like humans their age, much to Splinter's dismay.
Fifteen years later, the Turtles defeat a gang of criminals to recover a stolen moped belonging to a teenager named April O'Neil, revealing themselves and their origins. April, an aspiring journalist, has been investigating a series of robberies of TCRI technology by a criminal known as "Superfly". The Turtles plan to stop Superfly and, through April's reporting, win public acceptance as heroes. They intercept a piece of stolen technology and meet Superfly under the Brooklyn Bridge, discovering that he is not only a mutant himself, but leader of a mutant gang. Ecstatic to meet fellow mutants, the Turtles bond with Superfly and the others and he reveals their creation at the hands of Stockman, explaining that they evaded TCRI and are living on an abandoned ship in Staten Island. He then reveals that he plans to use the stolen technology to mutate every animal on Earth and create a world where mutants have dominance over humans.
The Turtles try to intervene, but the gang escapes with the equipment while a tracker TCRI installed on the equipment falls back with the Turtles, allowing them to be captured. At TCRI headquarters, Cynthia extracts the Turtles' mutagen, but April arrives with Splinter to rescue them. At the gang's hideout, Splinter and the Turtles convince them that their plan for domination will make them no better than the worst of humanity, and together they turn on Superfly, destroying his machine. However, the ooze falls into the water, combining marine wildlife with Superfly, who then transforms into a gigantic whale-like kaiju after grabbing animals from a nearby zoo. He attacks the city and the Turtles and other mutants attempt to stop him but are assumed by the public to be fellow monsters.
Leonardo finds his voice as a leader while April overcomes her anxiety and commandeers a news broadcast to explain the mutants' good intentions and the citizens of New York come to their aid. With the help of the citizens and other mutants, the Turtles drop a canister of TCRI retro-mutagen into Superfly's blowhole, turning him back into a collection of normal animals. Reconciling with Splinter, the Turtles, April, and the mutants are celebrated by the city. The Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are embraced as heroes. While the Turtles and April enjoy themselves at prom, they are under surveillance from Cynthia (holding the now unmutated Superfly captive), who plans to recapture the Turtles by enlisting the aid of the mysterious Shredder.

Producers Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg and director Jeff Rowe
Following the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) and its sequel, Out of the Shadows (2016), Brian Robbins felt that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film series was in dire need of a reboot.[7] He sought advice from longtime Turtles toy manufacturer Playmates Toys, who told him that the reboot should be an animated film.[7] In 2018, Robbins discussed with newly appointed executive vice president of Nickelodeon Animation Studio, Ramsay Naito, who to bring onto the project. Seth Rogen was decided upon, and Jeff Rowe joined the project soon after.[8] In June 2020, Deadline Hollywood reported that Nickelodeon Animation was developing a CG-animated Turtles film for Paramount Pictures. Rowe was hired to direct, from a screenplay by Brendan O'Brien.[9] Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and James Weaver produced through their production company, Point Grey Pictures, which is credited alongside Nickelodeon Movies.[10] Naito and Josh Fagen oversaw production for Nickelodeon and Point Grey, respectively.[9]
In an August 2020 interview with Collider, Rogen said that the film would heavily lean into the teenage element of Turtles. He stated,[11]
As a lifelong fan of Ninja Turtles, weirdly the 'Teenage' part of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was always the part that stuck out to me the most. And as someone who loves teenage movies, and who's made a lot of teenage movies, and who literally got their start in their entire profession by writing a teenage movie, the idea of kind of honing in on that element was really exciting to us. I mean, not disregarding the rest, but really using that as kind of a jumping-off point for the film.
In June 2021, Rogen revealed a teaser image through his Twitter page, which contained school notes written by Leonardo, the film's original release date, and other details.[12] By October 2021, the film was under the working title Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Next Chapter.[13] Production designer, Yashar Kassai, elaborated on the project, "You anchor yourself enough in the familiar elements of it so that it is easily recognizable, but then you either add to or enhance some of the existing charm of the franchise."[13] The title Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem had been finalized by August 2022.[14] Kyler Spears joined the film as co-director, signing on because he had worked with Rowe on his prior film, The Mitchells vs. the Machines (2021).[15][16] J.J. Villard was commissioned to design the film's logo.[17] Overall, the budget was $70 million at minimum.[18][19]
Writing
edit
Rogen, Goldberg, and Rowe, along with the writing team of Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit, received screenplay credit, with O'Brien and the former three having "story by" billing.[20] Rogen and Rowe wanted the film to emphasize the teenage aspect of the Turtles.[8] Rowe compared Mutant Mayhem to the coming-of-age films, Stand by Me (1986) and Lady Bird (2017) and remarked that his goal was to make "the ultimate teenage coming-of-age film". He described the Turtles as having an "inauthentic confidence that teenagers have", adding that teenagers often ''operate with this hyped-up sense of, 'We can do anything!'"[21] The writers wanted to create their own version of Turtles lore and did not take all elements from previous iterations into account. Rowe explained that they aimed "to make it more logical", and skated past a lot of things "to make it really operate from a place of character and relatability".[22] Rowe cited his admiration for the classic Turtles toys as the reason why a lot of mutant characters were written into the film.[23]
Shredder was originally the main villain of the film, but was written out because Rowe wanted the film's villain to be a mutant who could relate to the Turtles and who the Turtles could relate to and be tempted by.[24] Superfly was originally going to be a mutated version of Baxter Stockman, a character who has been turned into a mutant fly in past Turtles media. The two ultimately wound up being separate characters.[25] An early draft of Mutant Mayhem was more of a high school film. Rowe explained that with the initial version, it was hard to make the Turtles' lives intersect with the crime villain plot in a natural way, adding that the Turtles had already achieved their goal early on in the script. As a result, the film had to "reset 30 minutes in", and new characters, other kids in the high school, and relationships had to be established. Rowe described it as "tedious". Eventually, in July 2022, Rogen approached Rowe through text message, telling him that the film was "fundamentally broken" and had to be completely changed, a sentiment with which Rowe agreed. Consequentially, in the next four months, the film was completely rewritten and boarded into its final state.[26]
Casting and voice recording
edit
 
 
 
Ayo Edebiri, Jackie Chan, and Ice Cube voice April O'Neil, Splinter, and Superfly, respectively.
On March 4, 2023, during the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, Rogen revealed that actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon (all of whom were in attendance) had been cast in the voice roles of the Turtles: Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael. Other cast members revealed in their respective roles in the ceremony were Rogen himself, Hannibal Buress, Rose Byrne, John Cena, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Natasia Demetriou, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, Post Malone, Paul Rudd, and Maya Rudolph.[27][28]
Mutant Mayhem marks the first time all four Turtles are portrayed by teenage actors.[29] Rogen felt that the decision to cast teenagers for the parts in the film, made it stand out from previous versions of Turtles, saying "something very intuitive became something that really opened up our version".[30] Hundreds of actors auditioned for the roles of the Turtles. Rowe watched every tape and narrowed them down to the ones he felt worked. He edited voices into the character designs to see which suited which. After narrowing it down to ten, Abbey, Brown, Cantu, and Noon had a chemistry table read together, with them ultimately landing the roles. Rowe described the four as "perfect", and the table read as "kinetic and alive".[31] In recruiting Chan, he wrote a letter to him asking if he wanted to be part of a Turtles film. The team held a meeting with Ice Cube, who, when told his character's name was Superfly, laughed and agreed to sign on. Ice Cube also chose to sign on because of his and his son's emotional connection with the Turtles franchise.[16]
Abbey drew from the characteristics of his friends and previous portrayals of the character for his performance as Donatello.[32] Brown did not want to do the typical "surfer dude" voice for Michelangelo during the audition process. Inspired by Brandon Mychal Smith's take on the character in Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2018–2020), he sought to do his "own thing with it".[33] Cantu wanted to bring a "quality of nervousness" to Leonardo, feeling that there was a "level of anxiety that comes with leading the group". Noon wanted to balance Raphael's rage with a more lighthearted and funny performance to make him more relatable.[34] In portraying April O'Neil, Edebiri wanted to hearken back to her teenage years and tap into her character's determination.[35] Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman appears in a voice cameo as a citizen that helps Splinter during the climax, credited as "Good Human". Rowe wanted the role to be voiced by "someone meaningful to the franchise", and chose to cast Eastman as an homage to Stan Lee's cameos in Marvel Comics adaptations until his passing in 2018.[26] Scumbug uses a blend of different voices, including Rowe's, but is ultimately credited to Alex Hirsch.[5]
In contrast to the norm for animation, the cast recorded their voice roles together in groups rather than independently from one another. A single recording session could include up to seven actors. This environment allowed for the cast to play off each other as well as employ a lot of improvisation in their performances.[36] Rogen was partly influenced to apply this approach to the film from his experience recording The Lion King (2019) with Donald Glover and Billy Eichner.[37] He directed particular praise towards Abbey, Brown, Cantu, and Noon and said that they tried to "capture the way they actually interacted with each other" in the film. He recalled an account of one recording session with the quartet and how "they would all hang out together in the kitchen of the recording studio, and they would all just talk over each other and make fun of each other; screaming at each other." According to him, the event was what pushed them to start having the four record together, as he felt that the energy was right for the film.[36]
Design
edit
Like with his previous outing, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, Rowe wanted Mutant Mayhem to look different from what was expected from an animated film. The director's aim was to make it heavily resemble the concept art.[38] He was inspired by sketches he made in school notebooks as a teenager and how they tend to have a lot of exaggerated features, spikes, and random effects lines, and wanted the film's animation to reflect a similar feeling.[39] Rowe described the film's sketch look as its "North Star", as the comic book-inspired look was for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018).[16]
Production designer Yashar Kassai found working out the style of the film one of the most difficult parts of the production. He and Rowe encouraged the artists to embrace their imperfections and draw like teenagers. Kassai cited the 1987 television series and the classic toyline as big inspirations for the production team. "We were looking back to the time when sophomoric gross-out humor was the comedic style of the day. So we started there, but then we added the teenage drawing aspect on top of it as a very strong top layer."[40] The visuals were also heavily influenced by Wong Kar-wai's films, such as Chungking Express (1994), and the street photography of Alex Webb. The team would select two to three colors for a scene and aim to adhere to realistic photographic principles, contrasting with the abstract design philosophy.[41] Since a lot of the film takes place at night, the artists spent a lot of time diversifying what New York looks like at night and giving it a variety of different color schemes.[40]
 
Concept art of the Turtles
Rowe and lead character designer Woodrow White pushed for less bulky versions of the Turtles and to have the main four sport more teenage builds. Similar to Michelangelo and his braces, Donatello was given glasses not as a defining trait of geekiness and wisdom but rather as one of adolescence.[42] With Splinter, White wanted to lean into the dad aspect of the character and have him look disheveled "from the stresses of parenthood." As a ninja master, Splinter wears a kataginu he cut from a bathrobe, which also reflects the DIY nature of the character. Additionally, White gave him sweatpants, which he described as "a common staple of stay-at-home parents". Jeff Bridges's Dude character from The Big Lebowski (1998) served as inspiration for Splinter's fashion, while his build was inspired by Danny DeVito. White also studied photos of actual rats when designing the character.[42] For Splinter's fighting style, the filmmakers studied his actor, Jackie Chan, in films such as Police Story (1985) and Rumble in the Bronx (1995).[43]
White did not want to make Leatherhead look too muscular, but rather very much like what an actual alligator would look like if it stood on two legs. He collaborated with Kassai when designing Genghis Frog and based the character's look on that of a pixie frog. Rocksteady was given a larger head to emphasize the character's horn, which White felt was a rhinoceros's defining feature. With Ray Fillet, he wanted to give the character a more "menacing edge" and "inject more manta ray" into him. Similarly, White wanted Wingnut to be more bat-like than previous versions of the character by keeping her wings on her arms.[42]
Animation and cinematography
edit
Mutant Mayhem was animated by Mikros Animation in Montreal and Paris[44] and Cinesite in Vancouver and Montreal.[45] Mikros was hired in 2022 to handle the bulk of the animation, with Cinesite joining soon after to produce nearly 25 minutes.[46]
Mikros was one of many studios that completed a test shot for the feature. It featured 40 seconds of Donatello talking. The studio was tasked with matching the CGI animation as closely as possible to the 2D reference provided. According to Mikros visual effects supervisor Matthieu Rouxel, Rowe told them, "If the picture looks like a 2D painting when it is not moving, that means we are good". The test helped Mikros realize the need to make specific developments to their rendering for the film: stylized shaders, curves, and edges.[47]
Mikros built a shader prototype using the toonshader of the Autodesk Arnold render engine as a starter base. While the prototype was good for the test, the team knew they had to develop it further for the scale of a film. Rowe told the studio to avoid a "Photoshop filter feeling". The team realized the sophistication of the look and the need to be able to add graphic features to the lighting, "making it look as if they were painted one after another with different strokes". Mikros worked with Marcel Reinhard—the lead developer of shading, lighting, and rendering—to develop a shader that could isolate lights on the shading of objects and characters and give them special treatments. These treatments included scribbles, cross-hatching, stepping, and color transitions.[47]
As the film's stylized CGI employs elements of 2D animation to achieve a sketchbook look, Cinesite's staffers, who had only had experience with CGI, had to quickly learn how to use 2D. To speed up the process, they sought out sequences and style guides from Mikros. Additionally, a group of five traditional 2D effects animators to train the team were assembled, and Toon Boom Animation software was brought into their pipeline. Using these resources and tools, Cinesite developed internal animation tests, with regular feedback from Rowe on whether they matched Mikros' work.[46]
Kent Seki, head of cinematography, wanted to highlight the Turtles' youthfulness by keeping the camera close, handheld, and alive. He described it as being shot like "[you're] on the run" and used teenagers knack for getting into trouble as inspiration. To capture the Turtles as they engaged in antics both comedic and action, he adopted a cinéma vérité style of filming, shaped by the works of Emmanuel Lubezki and Spike Jonze. Seki also sought to contrast Jonze's handheld style with a more formal camera language influenced by early Paul Thomas Anderson and his cinematographer Robert Elswit's work in Boogie Nights (1997).[42] When shooting scenes, they would alternate between these two different methods to present a dichotomy of the teenage world and the adult world: "So if the kids were being reprimanded by Splinter, [we] would be much steadier with the camerawork, and then when we cut back to the kids, they'd be a little bit more handheld, a little more loose, and those kinds of things started to creep into the cinematography."[42]
Music

Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (soundtrack)
In May 2023, it was announced that the score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, with Gabe Hilfer as music supervisor.[48] The score album was released by Reznor's label, The Null Corporation on July 28, 2023.[49] Mutant Mayhem features hip-hop music from popular artists, with a heavy emphasis on classic East Coast hip-hop to go with the film's setting.[50] Many of the songs used in the films were ones that Rogen and Rowe would regularly listen to.[51][26] An official playlist of some songs featured in the film was released on Spotify.[50]
Themes
edit
Goldberg described the film as overall being about a father, his four sons, and the importance of family.[40] A major theme in the film is acceptance. The Turtles' isolation from the world is meant to mirror a teenager's desire to fit in, and their father, Splinter, fears the worst in humanity after being rejected by them. The theme was an early part of Rogen and Goldberg's pitch. Rowe felt that it was something that had not been tackled in the franchise before, saying "It acknowledges these fantastical things in a way that grounds them in the real world".[52] When asked whether the film was written as an immigration fable, Rowe responded that, while that was not the intention, as the story came along, the team started to recognize the parallels between Splinter and a first-generation parent who moved to the country. According to the director, a lot of the team have had such family situations, and the theme became something they continued to lean on, "so it wasn't the intention, but it became highlighted through execution."[26]

Reception

Box office
edit
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem grossed $118.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $61.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $180.5 million.[77][19] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $204.5 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, and other costs; box office grosses, merchandise, television and streaming, and home media revenues placing it fourth on their list of 2023's "Most Valuable Blockbusters".[78]
In the United States and Canada, Mutant Mayhem was projected to gross around $30 million from 3,851 theaters in its five-day opening weekend.[18] The film made $10.2 million on its first day (including $3.85 million from Tuesday night previews).[79][80] It went on to make $28 million in its opening weekend (and a total of $43 million over the five days), finishing fourth behind Barbie, Meg 2: The Trench, and Oppenheimer.[81] The film made $15.7 million and $8.4 million in its second and third weekends, finishing in third and fourth, respectively.[82][83] According to The Hollywood Reporter, the SAG-AFTRA strike, and Rogen and the cast's resulting inability to promote the film, potentially impacted its box office earnings by 15%. Industry insiders speculated that the film might have experienced a setback of $7–10 million.[56] In China, the film bombed, making $310,000 over its three-day opening weekend and finishing ninth.[84]
Critical response
edit
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem received positive reviews from critics. The film's performances, screenplay, and stylized animation were widely praised, and several critics considered it the best Turtles film.[85]
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 251 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "With its unique visual style and a story that captures the essence of the franchise's appeal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is an animated treat for the whole family."[86] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[87] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 88% overall positive score, with 70% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[81]
Lauding the film, Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called it "an unexpectedly delightful challenge to the critic’s reflexive antifranchise mentality".[88] Tom Jorgensen of IGN who gave the film an 8 out of 10 rating, spoke positively of it, though criticized the plot for being predictable. He wrote that the film "oozes confidence, energy, and heart" and represents "a new high for the Turtles on the big screen".[89] Charlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard, who awarded the feature 4 out of 5 stars, praised the portrayal of April O'Neil as well as Edeberi's performance of the character. She said that the film was "peppy, anarchic, doesn’t talk down to teens, looks scrumdiddlyumptious, boasts an impeccably laconic soundtrack and gives us April O’Neil as we’ve never seen her before".[90] Empire's John Nugent summarized in his 4 out 5 star rating review: "Inventively animated, giddily funny, and a surprisingly authentic take on the outsider experience: it is virtually impossible not to be charmed by these reptilian bros".[91]
/Film's Rafael Motomayor gave the film a 9 out of 10 rating, saying that it "is not only a great introduction to the iconic franchise, but a fantastic film in its own right, and one of the best-looking movies of the year".[92] Liz Miller of Consequence, who gave the film an A− grade, commended the use of licensed tracks, writing that the montage set to Blackstreet’s "No Diggity" "might be one of the most beautifully animated sequences of the year so far".[93] Deadline Hollywood's Pete Hammond applauded the screenplay, humor, and performances of Abbey, Brown, Cantu, and Noon. He concluded, "Rogen has made his mark on a franchise that still finds new ways to smartly entertain amid all that mayhem".[94]
Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com, who gave the feature a 2.5 out of 5 star rating, considered the animation a highlight but criticized the story and characterization for lacking depth.[95] Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge commended the direction but called the screenplay "wildly original in places" but a "recycled glob of tired clichés in others".[96] The Daily Beast's Nick Schager praised the direction and animation but largely disliked the film for its humor, use of references, and story. He wrote, "Considering Rogen's participation as both a writer and actor, it's surprising that Mutant Mayhem plays it so safe, not merely in terms of plot but with regards to its comedy."[97]

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Rowe, 2023) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Token Girl in the Group (Medium Risk)
    - Example: April O'Neil is the only major female character in the main ensemble.
    - Elevated by Edebiri’s distinct, grounded performance and her own narrative agency, but still isolated gender-wise.

  2. Nerd with Glasses = Smart (Low Risk)
    - Example: Donatello wears glasses, subtly reinforcing visual shorthand for intelligence.
    - Mitigated by emphasis on adolescence rather than intelligence.

  3. Wise Mentor Parent (Low Risk)
    - Example: Splinter is the disciplinarian father and martial arts guide.
    - Slightly subverted by his overprotective awkwardness and Dad-like behavior.

  4. Chill/Funny Black Teen Sidekick Energy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Michelangelo’s voice and demeanor fall into familiar patterns of the comedic “chill” archetype.
    - Balanced by his vulnerability and youth, but still plays to type.

  5. One-Note Angry Sibling (Low Risk)
    - Example: Raphael’s anger is foregrounded as his main trait.
    - Given moments of tenderness and balance to round out the character.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. Prejudice Against the Other (Low Risk)
    - Example: Humanity fears mutants until a heroic act redeems them.
    - Classic arc, made fresh by teen relatability and urban immersion.

  7. Evil Plan = Global Transformation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Superfly seeks to mutate all animals and rule Earth.
    - Familiar “villain wants to change the world” trope; rescued by humor and mutant relatability.

  8. The Big Fight Saves the World (Low Risk)
    - Example: Final battle involves defeating a massive kaiju and saving New York.
    - Classic climax, redeemed by chaotic charm and ensemble execution.

  9. Villain Turns into Giant Monster (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Superfly becomes a monstrous kaiju hybrid.
    - Colorful and comedic, but structurally formulaic.

  10. News Broadcast as Exposition Rescue (Medium Risk)
    - Example: April commandeers a live feed to explain the Turtles’ goodness.
    - Clear trope, though emotionally motivated and thematically fitting.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

  11. Hyper-Stylized Urban Chaos (Low Risk)
    - Example: New York is rendered with graffiti-like texture and handheld-inspired movement.
    - Purposeful and emotionally resonant; not a trope so much as a genre signature.

  12. Retro-Hip-Hop Montage to Establish Cool (Low Risk)
    - Example: Needle drops like “No Diggity” frame bonding and fight prep.
    - Familiar but justified through tone, setting, and era specificity.

  13. Glowing MacGuffin Device (Medium Risk)
    - Example: TCRI’s retro-mutagen is brightly colored and conveniently explodes.
    - Necessary for the narrative, but follows typical design cues.

  14. Pop Culture Reference Avalanche (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Layered references from anime to Marvel to vintage games.
    - Fun for genre-savvy viewers, but risks overloading newcomers.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

  15. Improvised Team = Instant Family (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The mutant gang unites with the Turtles in the final act.
    - Uplifting and swift, but requires quick emotional buy-in.

  16. High School = Ultimate Acceptance (Low Risk)
    - Example: Final act has the Turtles attending prom.
    - A literalization of the teen “fitting in” fantasy; tropic but tonally appropriate.

  17. Evil Corporation Wants to Experiment on Kids (Medium Risk)
    - Example: TCRI wants to capture and dissect the Turtles.
    - Common setup, only lightly complicated by Cynthia Utrom’s characterization.

  18. Final Drop = Instant Cure (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Retro-mutagen reverses Superfly’s transformation instantly.
    - Quick resolution mechanism, standard for animated family fare.

  19. Villain Tease Sequel Setup (Low Risk)
    - Example: Shredder revealed in the post-climax scene.
    - Genre-standard tease, presented cleanly.

  20. Flashback = Tragic Origin (Low Risk)
    - Example: Baxter’s mutagen story and Splinter’s past rejection.
    - Effectively delivered; tropey but emotionally grounded.

Lieberman began writing the script in 2016, which was acquired by 20th Century Fox shortly after. Levy passed on the script but reconsidered after Hugh Jackman introduced him to Reynolds, resulting in him leaving the film adaptation of the Uncharted video game he had been developing. The acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney made Free Guy one of the first films produced by the studio to continue production under Disney's ownership. Filming took place in Massachusetts and California between May and July 2019.
After the film was delayed two times by the COVID-19 pandemic, it premiered at the 74th Locarno Film Festival on August 10, 2021, and was released theatrically in the United States three days later, on August 13, in RealD 3D, IMAX, 4DX and Dolby Cinema formats. The film was a commercial success, grossing $331.5 million worldwide against a $100–125 million production budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics for its concept, comparing it to films and video games such as Ready Player One (2018), The Truman Show (1998), The Matrix (1999), Grand Theft Auto, and Fortnite.[6][7] It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards.
Plot
edit
Free City is an online game[8] developed by Soonami Studios. Its "players" (the online persons who have real lives beyond Free City) wear sunglasses and spend their time fighting each other and causing mayhem. The non-player characters (NPCs) accept the chaos while living out their scripted lives, unaware that the world they live in is a video game. These NPCs include Guy, who works as a clerk in Free City's bank with his best friend, security guard Buddy.
Unemployed software developer Millie Rusk plays Free City to find proof that Soonami stole the source code from the concept game she developed, Life Itself, which included novel artificial intelligence techniques for its NPCs. Her friend and co-developer Walter "Keys" McKey is reluctant to help, as he now works in technical support at Soonami. Millie's avatar "MolotovGirl" catches Guy's attention by singing his favorite song, "Fantasy". Guy then begins to deviate from his programming, accidentally shooting a player, robbing the bank at which he works, and leaving with the player's sunglasses.
Believing Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC, Keys and his coworker Mouser unsuccessfully try to ban him from the game. Accessing the players' view of the game, Guy visits new areas and meets Millie at vlogger Revenjamin Buttons' stash house, where they attempt to steal evidence leading to her source code. Believing Guy to be a novice player, she advises him to level up. Guy rapidly progresses through the game by completing missions benevolently, standing out from other players and becoming a worldwide sensation known as "Blue Shirt Guy".
As Keys realizes that Guy truly is an NPC, other NPCs that Guy interacts with also begin to develop self-awareness. However, Free City 2 is due to release in 48 hours and will replace Free City, terminating all of its NPCs. Millie tells Guy the truth about his existence, but he becomes distraught and breaks off contact. Guy eventually realizes that there is something more to an NPC's existence, and goes with Buddy to get the evidence Millie wanted from Buttons, who accidentally glitched through the edge of Free City's map and discovered an older build of Life Itself, recording a video clip in the process. Guy's popularity threatens the plans of Soonami's CEO Antwan Hovachelik to launch Free City 2, so he orders a server reboot which resets Guy's memories. Guy regains his self-awareness when Millie kisses him.
Guy recalls the location of an island containing remnants of the Life Itself build and they attempt to reach it before the Free City 2 launch wipes all old content from the servers. Antwan fires Keys, has every player removed from Free City, and sends an unfinished Guy-resembling character named Dude into the game. Initially overwhelmed, Guy then puts his sunglasses on Dude, distracting him. Guy then proceeds to the island. Furious, Antwan begins smashing the game's network server racks with an axe in a last-ditch attempt to stop Guy, erasing Buddy and much of the game world, while firing Mouser. Before he can destroy the final server, Millie offers a deal to not sue him for copyright infringement and surrender the Free City franchise's profits to him in exchange for her creation.
Sometime later, sales for Free City 2 slip because of bugs in the code and lagging online play. An embattled Antwan is in the crosshairs, but claims he is a victim of circumstance. Millie salvages her code and along with Keys and Mouser, releases the indie game Free Life, which includes Guy, Dude, and the other NPCs from Free City. Guy reveals to Millie that his code is actually a love letter to her from Keys. During the development of Life Itself, Keys had encoded what he knew about her tastes into an AI routine in the game, which was eventually incorporated into Free City, explaining why Guy felt drawn to MolotovGirl. After Millie leaves the game, she and Keys kiss. Meanwhile, Guy and Dude reunite with Buddy, whose AI algorithm was reconstructed.

Development

Free Guy director Shawn Levy
In August 2016, Matt Lieberman spent three weeks writing the first draft of the spec script for Free Guy.[20] This was sold and entered development at 20th Century Fox prior to being acquired by The Walt Disney Company. Free Guy is one of the first Fox films to continue production under Disney's ownership, as well as under the studio's new name of 20th Century Studios.[21] Director Shawn Levy originally passed on the script. After he was introduced to Ryan Reynolds by a mutual friend Hugh Jackman (whom Levy directed in Real Steel and Reynolds costarred with in X-Men Origins: Wolverine), Levy and Reynolds decided to work on Free Guy after rereading it together.[4] Reynolds, who also produced the film, said, "I haven't been this fully immersed and engaged in something since Deadpool."[21] Levy had previously been attached to the film Uncharted, an adaptation of the video game series of the same name, before he left to make Free Guy.[22]
Filming
edit
Principal photography began on May 14, 2019,[23] in Boston, mostly around the city's Financial District.[24][25] It also took place in the Massachusetts cities of Worcester,[26] Framingham (in the former Framingham Savings Bank building),[27] and Weymouth (at the former Naval Air Station),[28] as well as at Revere Beach[29] and the Paramount Pictures studio headquarters in Los Angeles, California. Filming concluded on July 31, 2019.[23]
Design and cultural references
edit
Levy decided to hire production designer Ethan Tobman over other candidates with more feature film experience after being inspired by the energy he brought to the project. Together they created a visual bible laying out the rules for their video game world. To split the real world from the in-game look they specified colors, lenses, composition and framing, camera movement, and other details.[22] Levy found it liberating to be influenced by other games and films but not required to make a direct adaptation of an existing franchise.[22] Tobman said the film's game-world design drew primary inspiration from games like SimCity, The Sims and Red Dead Redemption 2, while also acknowledging thematic inspiration from Grand Theft Auto and Fortnite.[8] In order to help Reynolds fully tap into his Guy character after Deadpool, Levy suggested that he tap into his Canadian background and act very friendly, full of joy, a typical Canadian citizen. He also found inspiration in Peter Sellers' role in Being There and Will Ferrell's role in Elf because they played characters who were similar to Guy's character being simple-minded.[30]
The film features several weapons from other video game and film franchises, including a Mega Buster from Mega Man, a lightsaber from Star Wars, one of Fortnite's pickaxes, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2, the portal gun from Portal, as well as Captain America's shield and Hulk's fist from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When the film was acquired by Disney, which owns the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, the filmmakers made a request to use iconic weapons from those properties, and were granted permission to use everything they requested.[16][8][22] The cameo by Chris Evans was suggested by Reynolds' wife Blake Lively.[31] Levy contacted Evans, who was already in Boston shooting Defending Jacob and asked if he would come by for ten minutes, and he agreed.[32]
Music
edit
Main article: Free Guy (soundtrack)
The film's score was composed by Christophe Beck.[33] Portions of the film's score are sampled from the Disney animated short film Paperman, which Beck had previously scored. Levy had originally intended to use the song "Your Love" by the Outfield, but Reynolds suggested using "Fantasy" by Mariah Carey instead.[16] Reynolds talked to Carey about obtaining permission to use it and she allowed them to use the song throughout the film.[34] A cover version of "Fantasy" sung by Comer was also used in the film.[16][22]

Box office

Free Guy grossed $121.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $209.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $331.5 million.[1][5]
In the United States and Canada, Free Guy was released alongside Respect and Don't Breathe 2, and was initially projected to gross $15–18 million from 4,165 theaters in its opening weekend.[61] However, after making $10.5 million on its first day (including $2.2 million from Thursday-night previews), estimates were raised to $26 million. It went on to debut to $28.4 million, topping the box office.[6] The film made $18.5 million in its second weekend, remaining in first. The drop of just 34% marked the smallest second-weekend decline of any wide release of the summer and the second-best of Reynolds' career.[62] In its third weekend, it was beaten by newcomer Candyman, but the film continued to hold well, falling by 27% earning $13.6 million.[63]
Critical response
edit
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 297 reviews and an average rating of 7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Combining a clever concept, sweet, self-aware humor, and a charming cast, Free Guy is frivolous fun."[64] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[65] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[6]
Peter Debruge of Variety magazine called the film an "at-times unwieldy mashup of multiple-reality blockbusters like The Matrix and The Lego Movie" and said that "Free Guy is a lot of fun, despite the fact that Levy and the screenwriters seem to be changing the rules as they go."[66] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times lauded both the "perfectly cast" Reynolds and "superb and charming Jodie Comer." Giving the film three out of four stars, he wrote "Thanks in large part to the vibrant, funny, sweet, endearing work by Reynolds and Comer, Free Guy delivers."[67] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+ grade and said, "For all its casual mayhem, Free Guy turns out to be a rather cuddly crowdpleaser, a high-concept blockbuster trifle with bubblegum ice cream clogging its circuits." Dowd contrasted the film with The Truman Show, saying "Reynolds replicates that slightly unhinged Truman Burbank grin but not the desperation behind it."[68] Nick De Semlyen of Empire was critical of the film; he compared it unfavorably to 2018's Ready Player One, and said that although it is "eager to please" it "doesn't really hang together, even as you're watching it."[69]

Free Guy (Levy, 2021) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. The Naive Nice Guy (Low Risk)
    - Example: Guy is a joyful, innocent NPC with no cynicism.
    - Subverted via self-awareness arc; still a trope but thematically essential.

  2. Woman As Catalyst for Awakening (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Millie/MolotovGirl initiates Guy's emotional and existential evolution.
    - Avoids objectification but still places the male transformation in response to female attention.

  3. The Funny Best Friend (Low Risk)
    - Example: Buddy exists mainly to support Guy’s arc and provide comic relief.
    - Endearing performance, but structurally familiar sidekick role.

  4. Evil Tech Bro CEO (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Taika Waititi’s Antwan is a narcissistic, meme-spouting villain.
    - Satirical and exaggerated, but rooted in now-common tech industry caricatures.

  5. Underdog Female Hacker (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Millie is framed as a genius programmer wronged by corporate theft.
    - Well-acted and competent, but leans on the “lone woman in tech” pattern.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  6. Hidden Reality Revelation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Guy learns he is inside a video game.
    - Strongly derivative of The Matrix and The Truman Show, but filtered through comedy.

  7. Reboot Erases Character Memory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Guy forgets everything after Antwan resets the server.
    - A plot-convenient wipe that creates a second-act dip and emotional rekindling.

  8. AI Becomes More Human Than Humans (Low Risk)
    - Example: Guy behaves more compassionately than real players or devs.
    - Classic sci-fi trope; framed sweetly here but familiar.

  9. Deus Ex Lover’s Kiss (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Millie kissing Guy restores his memory and consciousness.
    - Sentimental and serviceable but extremely conventional.

 10. Romantic Code Revelation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Guy’s personality is a “love letter” coded by Keys for Millie.
    - Touching twist, but veers into emotional determinism via code logic.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

 11. Glowy Video Game Interface Overlays (Low Risk)
    - Example: Glasses show HUD-style overlays of game mechanics.
    - Visually slick but standard for gaming-themed narratives.

 12. Pop Culture Weapon Parade (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Guy uses lightsabers, Mega Buster, Hulk fist, etc.
    - Played for humor, but leans heavily on nostalgia cameos.

 13. Flashy, Over-Saturated Game World (Low Risk)
    - Example: Free City is neon-colored, absurd, and perpetually chaotic.
    - Expected aesthetic, competently executed.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

 14. Corporate Sabotage as Villainy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Antwan literally smashes servers with an axe.
    - Effective metaphor but cartoonishly literal.

 15. Evil Twin Character (Low Risk)
    - Example: “Dude” is a jacked-up beta version of Guy.
    - Played for parody; trope acknowledged and undercut with humor.

 16. Instant Tech Solution (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Buddy’s AI is rebuilt quickly with little resistance.
    - Feel-good resolution, but technobabble solves too much too fast.

 17. Final Broadcast Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Guy and Millie stream their proof to the public.
    - Predictable endgame tactic to defeat corporate lies.

 18. Hidden Island = True World (Low Risk)
    - Example: The remnants of “Life Itself” exist as an unreachable utopia.
    - Common metaphor for idealistic creativity buried by monetization.

 19. Rebooted Game World = Happy Ending (Low Risk)
    - Example: “Free Life” is a utopia for NPCs post-Antwan.
    - Familiar wish-fulfillment ending structure, handled gently.

 20. Final Romantic Pairing = Human Closure (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Millie and Keys kiss, resolving their decade-long tension.
    - Sweet, but formulaic romance beat to end narrative arcs.

The second season of the American post-apocalyptic drama television series The Last of Us premiered on HBO on April 13, 2025. Based on the video game franchise developed by Naughty Dog, the season is set twenty-five years into a pandemic caused by a mass fungal infection, which causes its hosts to transform into zombie-like creatures and collapses society. The second season, based on the 2020 game The Last of Us Part II, follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) five years after the events of the first season, after they have settled into Jackson, Wyoming, with Joel's brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Ellie's friends Dina (Isabela Merced) and Jesse (Young Mazino).

HBO renewed The Last of Us for a second season less than two weeks after the series premiered in January 2023. Co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann were joined in the writers' room by Halley Gross and Bo Shim; Druckmann wrote and co-directed the games, and Gross co-wrote Part II. Principal photography took place in British Columbia from February to August 2024. Druckmann, Mazin, and Peter Hoar returned to direct the seven episodes alongside newcomers Kate Herron, Nina Lopez-Corrado, Mark Mylod, and Stephen Williams. Gustavo Santaolalla and David Fleming returned to compose the score.
Critics felt the season reinforced The Last of Us as the best video game adaptation, praising the action sequences, direction, performances, production design, and writing, though some criticized the pacing and considered the story incomplete. Across linear channels and Max, the season premiere was watched by 5.3 million viewers on the first day—a 13% increase from the first-season premiere.

10	1	"Future Days"	Craig Mazin	Craig Mazin	April 13, 2025	0.938[38]
Five years after Joel kills nineteen Fireflies at a hospital and rescues Ellie,[a] they live in Jackson, Wyoming, but their relationship has become strained. Joel's psychotherapist Gail admits her resentment toward him for killing her husband Eugene, while Joel expresses his sadness concerning Ellie and confesses that he saved her, though he omits the murders. On patrol, Ellie and Dina find an infected nest in a supermarket, and Ellie kills a new type of infected that silently stalks her. Ellie and Dina kiss at a party, prompting a homophobic slur from bar owner Seth; after Joel attacks him, an angered Ellie tells Joel she does not need his help, and he leaves. Infected tendrils begin to enter Jackson through a broken pipe as Abby and her friends—who have all sworn to kill Joel for the hospital massacre—approach the town from afar.
11	2	"Through the Valley"	Mark Mylod	Craig Mazin	April 20, 2025	0.643[39]
After taking shelter in a lodge near Jackson, Abby remains steadfast in her mission to kill Joel, while her friends, concerned about the town's security, consider retreating. While scoping out Jackson, Abby accidentally awakens a large horde of infected hiding under the snow. She escapes and is saved by Joel, on patrol with Dina. The horde make their way to Jackson, leading to a battle where the town suffers heavy damage and casualties. Abby brings Joel and Dina to the lodge, where Dina is knocked out and Abby reveals herself to be the daughter of the Firefly doctor who Joel killed at the hospital.[a] She shoots Joel in the leg and brutally beats him with a golf club. Ellie enters the lodge but is restrained by Abby's party and forced to watch helplessly as Abby fatally stabs Joel in the neck with the broken golf club's handle. Ellie swears to kill Abby, and Abby's group leaves. As Jackson begins to recover from the battle, Ellie, Dina, and Jesse return home with Joel's body.
12	3	"The Path"	Peter Hoar	Craig Mazin	April 27, 2025	0.768[40]
Three months later, Dina tells Ellie that the group who killed Joel—members of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF)—are based in Seattle. At a town hall meeting, several townspeople oppose sending a group to Seattle to track them down; Ellie reads a letter persuading the townspeople to send the group out of justice, not revenge, but the town council rejects the proposal. As Ellie gathers weapons to leave for Seattle alone, Dina tells her she will join, bringing appropriate supplies and planning a travel route. Seth, who vocally supported Ellie during the town hall, helps them leave Jackson. The following morning, Ellie leaves coffee beans on Joel's grave. Later, she and Dina encounter a group of dead Seraphites, including a young child, the sight of which causes Dina to vomit. They arrive in Seattle and note the lack of WLF members. Meanwhile, a convoy of dozens of soldiers march through the streets of Seattle with several armored vehicles.
13	4	"Day One"	Kate Herron	Craig Mazin	May 4, 2025	0.774[41]
In 2018, Isaac Dixon kills his Federal Disaster Response Agency (FEDRA) squad and switches allegiances to the WLF. Eleven years later, Isaac, now the WLF's leader, interrogates and later kills a Seraphite who refuses to share his group's location. Ellie and Dina's first day in Seattle sees them stumble upon the remains of the conflicts between FEDRA and the WLF. They hide out in a music store where Ellie serenades Dina. At night, they find several WLF soldiers brutally murdered by the Seraphites, and evade an incoming WLF backup squad. The two escape the WLF and the infected in the subway, but Ellie is bitten while saving Dina. As they hide in an abandoned theater, a heartbroken Dina prepares to shoot Ellie, who explains that she is immune. Dina confesses to Ellie that she is pregnant, and they have sex. The next morning, they overhear that the WLF, including Abby's friend Nora, are based at the Lakehill hospital, and Dina tells Ellie that she still wants to go with her.

Production

Development
edit


The television series was created by Craig Mazin (left) and Neil Druckmann (right). Druckmann wrote and co-directed the video games.[42]
HBO renewed The Last of Us for a second season on January 27, 2023, less than two weeks after the premiere of the first season.[43] While the first season covers the events of Naughty Dog's video game The Last of Us (2013) and its downloadable expansion The Last of Us: Left Behind (2014),[44] the second season covers part of the sequel, The Last of Us Part II (2020). Druckmann and Mazin wanted to avoid filler between the games.[45] Part II is expected to span multiple seasons,[46] and Mazin does not want the series to overtake the games.[47] While writing the first season, Mazin and Druckmann ensured characters remained true to their developments in Part II in case the show received more seasons.[48]
The series is a production of Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, Naughty Dog, the Mighty Mint, and Word Games, with Mazin, Druckmann, Carolyn Strauss, Evan Wells, Asad Qizilbash, and Carter Swan serving as returning executive producers;[43] Jacqueline Lesko, who co-executive produced the first season, was named an executive producer in March 2023,[49] followed by Cecil O'Connor, who produced the first season, by February 2024.[50][51] In January 2024, Druckmann, Mazin, and Peter Hoar were announced as returning directors alongside newcomers Kate Herron, Nina Lopez-Corrado, Mark Mylod, and Stephen Williams.[52] Inspired by Noah Hawley's work on Fargo, Mazin felt directing the premiere allowed him to prepare the full season, and he subsequently worked closely with each director on set.[53] In June, Mazin and Druckmann revealed the season would consist of seven episodes.[54] The series was renewed for a third season on April 9, 2025, before the second premiered.[55]
Casting
edit

Druckmann felt Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey's comfort and familiarity with their characters—Joel and Ellie, respectively—allowed them to "dive deeper" into their performances.[56] Pascal and Ramsey, who grew close during production of the first season, considered their separation "painful" and "lonelier" during filming for the second.[57] Ramsey added a "green rider" into their second-season contract, requiring all departments to adopt sustainable practices during production.[58] The season introduces several new characters and spends more time with them.[56] Mazin felt the new actors "fit right in" due to the series's established reputation.[53] Casting was put on hold in May 2023 due to the Writers Guild of America strike; actors had been auditioning with scenes from The Last of Us Part II due to an absence of scripts.[59]
The production team wanted to start the second season's casting with Abby; casting for the role began before the strike,[60][61][62] and Dever became the frontrunner after the strike ended in November,[63] following the response to her performance in No One Will Save You (2023).[64] She previously appeared in Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016),[56] and was considered to play Ellie in the abandoned film adaptation of The Last of Us around the time.[18] Her casting was announced on January 9, 2024,[15] followed by Mazino's as Jesse on January 10,[13] and Merced's as Dina on January 11.[12] O'Hara's casting was announced on February 2,[50] followed by Ramirez, Barer, Gabrielle, and Lord's on March 1,[27] Wright's on May 24,[33] and Ahlers, Burke, Lamanna, Pantoliano, Park, and Ubach's on March 5, 2025.[21]
Writing
edit

Halley Gross, who co-wrote The Last of Us Part II, joined the writers' room for the second season.[65]
A writers' room for the second season was established in Los Angeles by February 2023,[66] with Mazin and Druckmann joined by Halley Gross, who co-wrote Part II with Druckmann, and Bo Shim, a new writer.[65] Gross was also named co-executive producer.[67] Druckmann worked on the story during development of The Last of Us Part II Remastered (2024), allowing him to revisit and analyze its decisions and intricacies.[68] The writers began by splitting Part II's narrative into sections, then selecting some for the second season;[18] the seven-episode length was chosen as a natural breaking point.[56] They experimented with several methods of presenting the non-linear timeline, settling on what they found to be the "most impactful".[18] Splitting across seasons prompted narrative rearrangement to present information earlier than in the game, such as Abby's backstory and relationships.[69]: 0:25  Some changes were also made as the game's shifting player perspective between Ellie and Abby no longer applied.[32] Material removed from the game, including some presented in Part II Remastered, was added to the series.[18]
Druckmann considered himself biased when adapting the "intimately familiar" story and tried to keep an open mind with changes; he and Mazin generally agreed.[56] Scripts were being written by April 2023,[70] with a full outline mapped,[65] but writing was impacted by the writers' strike in May;[59] Mazin submitted the first episode about 90 minutes before the strike began,[71] and neither he nor Druckmann worked on the series while the strike was ongoing.[59] Instead, Mazin mentally outlined scenes while taking walks, described as "brain-writing", as he planned to quickly complete scripts after the strike to ensure a smooth production schedule.[65] Mazin wrote the first five episodes and co-wrote the final two with Druckmann and Gross.[35] The second season features themes of revenge, in contrast to the first season's unconditional love; Druckmann felt it was a "continuation of love from the first season, and this is just the dark side of that coin".[54] The second season, like the first, highlights several duos, such as Ellie and Dina.[53]
The second season is set five years after the first-season finale,[67] following the impact of Joel's lie to Ellie, which Mazin called the season's "beating heart".[53] It explores themes of tribalism and the impact of losing loved ones from within one's group,[14] and the troubling view of heroism when viewed from alternative perspectives.[72] It also highlights themes of change, growth, and escalation, reflected internally within characters like Ellie and communities like Jackson, Wyoming, as well as in the outside world, demonstrated by the enhanced types of infected.[73] Viewers' requests for additional infected scenes after the first season aligned with Druckmann and Mazin's own feelings, resulting in more focus on the infected in the second season.[72] The writers' familiarity with the show's production allowed for more action sequences, through which they maintained connections to character development.[73] Mazin felt the first season's limited action sequences were a result of its focus on Joel and Ellie, whereas the second season's additional characters granted a broader focus.[74]: 41:25  He wanted action sequences to demonstrate the desperation and loss that the characters often forget, partly inspired by the Game of Thrones episode "Hardhome" (2015).[53] Spores—the vector through which infection is spread in the games—return in the second season, having been replaced in the first by tendrils forming a unified network.[75][76]
Filming
edit






Filming took place in Kamloops (top) in February 2024,[77][78] Britannia Beach (center) in June and July,[79][80] and Downtown Vancouver (bottom) in July and August.[81][82]
The second season was filmed primarily in British Columbia[70][83] for over 150 days.[72] Vancouver replicates Seattle, assisted by sets created by the art teams.[56] Ksenia Sereda returned as the lead director of photography,[32] setting the tone for the season in the premiere with Mazin and working with Hoar, Williams, and Druckmann,[84][85] while Catherine Goldschmidt worked with Mylod, Herron, and Lopez-Corrado;[84][86] they alternated between episodes, with one filming while the other was preparing. Both had freedom during their episodes as they were largely standalone.[87] Sereda's work was inspired by the games, seeking to capture its cinematography.[84]
Delayed by the writers' and actors' strikes,[71] principal photography began on February 12, 2024,[88][89] running under the working title Mega Sword.[90] Filming took place in Kamloops in February,[77][78] and in Calgary, Alberta, on March 5–6,[91][92] before moving to Mission, Fort Langley, and Langley, replicating parts of Jackson.[92][93][94] Production returned to Alberta for 16 days from March 18, with filming in Exshaw, Fortress Mountain, and along Highway 1A from March 21–24 requiring a 72-hour partial highway closure.[95][96] HBO denied rumors that Pascal had finished filming in March.[97]
Mazin directed from February,[98][99] followed by Mylod directed in March,[99][100] followed by Herron and Hoar in April,[101][102] Williams and Druckmann in May,[103][104] and Lopez-Corrado in July.[105] Filming occurred in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside with soldiers and military vehicles on May 4,[56][106][94] and with Ramsey and Merced on horseback on May 11.[107][108][109] Filming took place in Nanaimo from May 13–14,[110] on a private Britannia Beach property on June 5, 7, 12, 13, and July 2,[79][111][80] and in Chinatown, Vancouver on July 8.[112][113][114] Druckmann's episode completed production by July 9.[115]
Filming returned to Downtown Eastside on July 12, and moved to Stanley Park on July 13 and Downtown Vancouver on July 25.[116][81] A section of Harbour Green Park in Coal Harbour was closed from July 25–27 for production.[81][117] Filming occurred in New Westminster on July 28, at the Orpheum theatre on July 29,[118] and around Cordova and Cambie Streets in Gastown from August 9–13.[82][119] The wrap party took place on August 18,[120] and principal photography was set to conclude on August 21,[100] several weeks before September 9 as originally scheduled;[121] it finished on August 23.[122] At least three rounds of additional photography took place over the next six months,[72] including in Downtown Vancouver—the exterior of the Guinness Tower and Oceanic Plaza—from September 13–17.[123][124][125] The production office closed on September 27.[122] The Vancouver Aquarium closed early for additional photography on January 15–16, 2025.[126]
Music
edit

Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose the score for the series alongside David Fleming.[127]
Gustavo Santaolalla and David Fleming returned to compose the score for the season; Santaolalla composed the music for the games.[127] Santaolalla considered each theme interchangeable, moving the games' music to different scenes in the series matching the same emotion.[128]: 59:41  He worked on the character-driven score and Fleming on action-driven, and they collaborated on blending the two. Fleming felt diverting from Santaolalla's original game score was often necessary to give the series its own identity,[129] but otherwise sought to maintain the same feeling and avoid unnecessary diversion. He felt their different approaches complemented their individual tasks for the series. Mazin worked with the composers to determine specific sounds for each character and group, such as Ellie, Abby's friends, and the infected.[130] They scored Abby to match her anger, pain, and trauma akin to Ellie's, rather than as a traditional antagonist.[129]
Druckmann considered music conducive to the narrative, akin to the game, with characters performing or listening to music contributing to worldbuilding or relationships.[56] The first episode is named after the Pearl Jam song "Future Days", which features in the game; while the song did not exist in 2003, when the outbreak takes place in the series, Mazin and Druckmann felt its inclusion was important and thematically appropriate to Joel and Ellie's character arcs.[131]: 5:24  The episode features cameo appearances by Santaolalla and Crooked Still, playing the latter's music which featured in the game.[132][133] The second episode is named after Shawn James's song "Through the Valley", and ends with a cover performed by Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Ellie in the games and Ellie's mother Anna in the series. Johnson's cover featured in the second game and its marketing; the one featured in the episode is a blend of her original performance and a new recording.[134] Mazin felt some lyrics represented the episode's events—while Jackson may be saved, souls have been damned—and others reflected an unachievable desire for its characters.[135]: 38:40 [134]
Post-production
edit
Timothy A. Good returned as lead editor for the second season alongside Emily Mendez as editor.[136][137] Good was also named a co-producer,[137] working on the sound mix early in post-production at Mazin's request.[138]: 2:03  The editors watch the material as it arrives, which Good finds overwhelming but necessary to find the best takes.[138]: 21:57  Mendez is a fan of the games while Good has not played them; Mendez worked with Mazin to approach scenes from the perspective of fans, while Good approached from a general viewpoint.[138]: 17:02  Good ensured scenes focused on Abby making decisions to allow audiences to understand her perspective despite her antagonistic actions.[139]
Mylod and first assistant director Dan Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Alex Wang to create previsualization for the full action sequence in the second episode.[140] The episode used over 600 visual effects shots, almost 200 more than the previous season's fifth episode.[141] While the bloater in that episode was initially performed practically before being replaced with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Wang and his team created the bloater in "Through the Valley" with CGI first to better understand its design.[142] Eleven visual effects teams worked on the episode,[141] including Wētā FX on the infected[135]: 26:00  and Important Looking Pirates on the bloater.[138]: 24:20 [143]

Reception

Critical response

Critics praised the performances of Isabela Merced (left) and Kaitlyn Dever (right) as Dina and Abby, respectively.[194][195][196]
The second season of The Last of Us received "universal acclaim" according to review aggregator Metacritic, with a weighted score of 81 out of 100 based on 42 reviews.[197] On Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 184 critics gave a positive review. The website's general consensus called it "a challenging expansion that retains its predecessor's superb performances and verisimilitude".[198] Critics felt the season reinforced The Last of Us as the best video game adaptation;[194][199] /Film's Jeremy Mathai felt it "sets a new standard".[200] Empire's John Nugent called it "another remarkable run of episodes" and "post-apocalyptic television at its peak",[201] and Collider's Ross Bonaime declared it "one of 2025's best seasons of TV".[194] Reviewers praised the action sequences, direction, performances, production design, and writing, though some criticized the pacing and considered the story incomplete.[202][203][204][205]
/Film's Matahi lauded the unified creative vision of each production department,[200] and Collider's Bonaime praised the matching of each director with their familiar subject matter.[194] Several reviewers compared the second episode's action sequences to Game of Thrones at its best;[206][207][208] Empire's Nugent called it "exceptional grand scale cinematic television few others than HBO can muster",[201] and The Times's James Jackson compared it to the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan (1998),[209] though IGN's Simon Cardy found it an overcorrection of the first season's scarce action and felt it overshadowed other pivotal moments.[195] Many critics considered the sixth episode the standout for highlighting Joel and Ellie's relationship,[194][209][16] though some felt it highlighted their noted absence elsewhere in the season[210][211] and IGN's Cardy thought it negatively impacted momentum.[195] Some reviewers considered the premiere episode effective[212][213] but the finale the weakest.[199][214] Praise was directed at the cinematography for highlighting performances and matching the game's cinematic qualities,[195][196][201] and the production design for its presenting the world's beauty and destruction,[201][215][216] though TheWrap's Chase Hutchinson found Seattle's recreation occasionally lacking.[217]
Several reviewers praised the season's deeper themes and more complex characters,[201][218][219] particularly in its focus on Ellie and others' relationships.[209][214][217] Radio Times's Louise Griffin lauded the "unrivalled storytelling" and the writers' mapping of details, perspectives, and flashbacks to develop the world,[220] and /Film's Mathai found many scenes gain additional meanings on repeated viewings.[200] Many praised the adaptation of scenes to fit the medium and some felt the original writing was the strongest,[194][200][221] though Total Film's Lauren Milici thought it "fails to capture the same emotional weight as the source material" with unsatisfying alterations,[222] and IGN's Cardy questioned whether Ellie and Abby's playability made the game more enjoyable.[195] Some reviewers felt the lack of scenes with Joel and Ellie left the second season weaker than the first,[210][211] and others found the quicker pace detrimental and the narrative unsatisfyingly incomplete,[195][210][214] particularly demonstrated in Seattle's warring factions.[199][213] The Hollywood Reporter's Angie Han wrote the season lacked the first's "rich lyricism ... sprawling humanity [and] devastating finality".[207] Some considered new characters like Abby, Isaac, and Hanrahan underdeveloped[199][211][220] and thought the non-chronological storytelling detracted from pacing and worldbuilding.[195][215][223] Others found the political allegories overly simplistic or offensive.[196][212]
Critics praised the cast's performances[6][222][224] and the chemistry between Pascal and Ramsey;[206][215][217] Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall found some episodes weaker for their absence,[211] and /Film's Mathai considered their subtler moments the most effective.[200] Critics lauded Pascal for bringing warmth, charisma, and hardiness to Joel[196][199][210]—Collider's Bonaime called his performance his career-best[194]—and Ramsey for developing Ellie into a traumatized young adult while maintaining emotional immaturity and playfulness.[216][220][223] Many reviewers considered Merced the season's highlight for her compassion and humor,[195][212][225] as well as her chemistry with Ramsey,[207][217][222] and Dever's performance was lauded for her portrayal of grief, rage, and hatred;[194][196][226] some felt her performance upstaged others'.[195][206] Several critics applauded O'Hara's dramatic acting abilities, particularly in light of her comedic role in The Studio airing simultaneously.[199][211][215] Praise was also directed towards the performances of Luna, Mazino, Wesley, and Wright,[195][200][201][222] though some reviewers considered them underserved and the characters underdeveloped;[207][213][222] Inverse's Valerie Ettenhofer found some interactions "strangely artificial" in contrast to the first season.[212]

The Last of Us: Season 2 (Mazin & Druckmann, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Grief-Driven Avenger (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie’s arc centers on vengeance after Joel’s murder.
    - Emotionally grounded but follows a familiar "revenge quest" structure.

  2. Stoic Assassin With a Heart (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Abby is a hardened killer but shown with emotional depth and complex motivations.
    - Attempts humanization, but fits a recognizable “sympathetic enforcer” mold.

  3. The Dead Mentor Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - Example: Joel’s death propels all primary character arcs.
    - Classic motivator trope used with nuance, but still archetypal.

  4. The Pregnant Burden (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dina’s pregnancy complicates her ability to participate in combat.
    - Adds emotional weight but risks reducing her role to a device.

  5. The Traumatized Child Hero (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ellie is both emotionally broken and incredibly capable.
    - Deep performance, but the juxtaposition of trauma and toughness is familiar.

  6. Guilt-Ridden Protector (Low Risk)
    - Example: Joel struggles with his past and choices before dying.
    - A somber, understated version of a well-worn trope.

  7. The Violent Woman Proving Herself (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Abby’s strength and brutality are contrasted with her femininity.
    - Well-acted but leans into “brutal woman as subversive” framing.

  8. The Token Redeemed Racist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Seth redeems himself by helping Ellie and Dina escape Jackson.
    - Plays into “bigot with a conscience” trope—functional, but familiar.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

  9. The Revenge Spiral (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Season’s thematic arc is built around revenge begetting more violence.
    - Profound in tone, but the escalation structure is genre-standard.

 10. Post-Apocalypse as Emotional Mirror (Low Risk)
    - Example: Society’s collapse reflects internal character decay and struggle.
    - Genre-appropriate and effective, but not original.

 11. Surprise Character Death (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Joel’s murder early in the season.
    - Powerfully executed, but it remains a sudden-death shock tactic.

 12. Nonlinear Flashback Structure (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Abby’s backstory and timeline are interwoven retroactively.
    - Enhances depth, but disrupts momentum and clarity for some viewers.

 13. Romantic Complication During Mission (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie and Dina’s relationship deepens during their vengeance quest.
    - Emotional weight present, but timing follows familiar patterns.

 14. The “We’re Not So Different” Theme (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie and Abby’s arcs mirror each other in trauma and retribution.
    - Core to the show’s themes, but clearly derived from narrative tradition.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

 15. War-Torn Urban Jungle (Low Risk)
    - Example: Seattle as a shattered militarized zone filled with factions and infection.
    - Visually striking but part of the post-apocalyptic genre’s standard toolkit.

 16. Brutalist Medical Facilities as Horror Zones (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Lakehill hospital teased as site of critical confrontation.
    - Effective but well-trodden setting for both horror and moral ambiguity.

 17. Handheld Chaos Aesthetic (Low Risk)
    - Example: Battle sequences use vérité-style chaos to heighten immersion.
    - Gritty and immediate but common in prestige action drama.

 18. Mutated Zombies as Environmental Pressure (Low Risk)
    - Example: New infected types push characters into harder moral or emotional terrain.
    - Consistent with genre, adds novelty but still familiar.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

 19. Secret Immunity Reveal (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dina learns Ellie is immune only after Ellie is bitten.
    - Delayed revelation is emotionally charged but structurally conventional.

 20. The “Factions Are Just as Bad” Moral (Medium Risk)
    - Example: WLF and Seraphites are both shown as violent and flawed.
    - Thematic complexity risks becoming nihilism if not balanced carefully.

 21. Hidden Infection Vector Returns (Low Risk)
    - Example: Spores return as a subtle nod to fans and an atmospheric danger.
    - Enhances world continuity, but their surprise reintroduction is a classic reset trope.

 22. Flashback-as-Episode Framing (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Isaac’s 2018 backstory opens the episode to contextualize current motives.
    - Adds emotional weight but predictable structural move.

 23. Comedic Actor Cast Against Type (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Catherine O’Hara plays a dramatic role in contrast to concurrent comedy.
    - Works well but fits recent prestige-TV casting trends.

 24. Narrative Anchoring in a Single Object (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ellie leaving coffee beans on Joel’s grave.
    - Simple and poignant, though symbolic-object-as-emotional-anchor is very common.

Senior attending physician Dr. Michael "Robby" Robinavitch starts a grueling shift at the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital's emergency room (ER), nicknamed "The Pitt" by its staff, by welcoming four newcomers: Victoria Javadi, a third-year medical student; Dennis Whitaker, a fourth-year medical student; Dr. Trinity Santos, an intern; and Dr. Melissa "Mel" King, a second-year resident. Throughout the next fifteen hours, the students and residents learn more about their professional duties, while trying to deal with the emotional toll of patient care and the hardships of working in an overcrowded and underfunded ER, guided by Robby and The Pitt's other staff members, including charge nurse Dana Evans, second-year resident Dr. Cassie McKay, third-year resident Dr. Samira Mohan, and senior residents Dr. Heather Collins and Dr. Frank Langdon. Meanwhile, Robby struggles to cope with traumatic memories resurfacing on the day of the fourth death anniversary of his beloved mentor, Dr. Adamson, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rivera's brother arrives to the ER, having developed an air embolism while helping other victims at the festival. Ignoring Walsh's objections, Mohan performs a risky procedure to save him, guided by Abbot. The shooter is reported dead. The team began treating Flynn, an unresponsive minor with measles and possible acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; Robby reports a potential outbreak to the Public Health Service. The police release David, but he is still placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, leading him to clash with his mother, Robby, and McKay. Jake's mother arrives to see him. Mel reunites a traumatized patient with her daughter, causing her to break down in tears. Robby becomes enraged with Flynn's mother, who is refusing to allow a lumbar puncture after having read alarmist health information on the Internet. Abbot asks Dana about Robby's well being.

Robby talks the police into releasing McKay, citing her heroic work that day. Santos deduces that Max attempted suicide and opens up to him about a friend who killed herself. McKay attempts to persuade David to accept counseling. Langdon begs Robby for a second chance, but the conversation devolves into an argument. A hospital employee is admitted with a crushed pelvis; Robby has difficulty focusing on his treatment. Robby guilt-trips Flynn's father into allowing the lumbar puncture without his wife's knowledge by showing him the bodies of PittFest victims. Mohan's manic energy wears off, and she cries in the bathroom. Robby gives a speech thanking the day-shift staff and dismisses them. Dana takes down photos from her desk, contemplating not returning to the Pitt. King picks up her sister at a care facility. Santos discovers Whitaker is homeless and squatting in a room in the hospital, so she invites him to live in her apartment. Abbot finds Robby at the edge of the hospital roof and emotionally exhorts him not to feel like a failure; the two then join several other doctors and nurses for a beer in the park before Robby finally heads home.

The Pitt (Gemmill, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Haunted Healer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Robby suffers PTSD from COVID-era trauma and patient deaths.
    - Richly developed but rooted in the familiar "guilt-ridden caregiver" motif.

  2. Young Idealist vs. Jaded Veteran (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Santos’s brash confidence clashes with Robby's cynical pragmatism.
    - Classic mentor/rookie clash dynamic, if well-executed.

  3. Abrasive Genius (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Santos alienates coworkers with her attitude, but proves highly skilled.
    - Overused, especially for young, marginalized women in drama settings.

  4. Misfit Prodigy (Low Risk)
    - Example: Javadi is talented but socially awkward and insecure.
    - Familiar medical trope with some fresh nuance.

  5. The Martyr Nurse (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dana is repeatedly shown sacrificing herself emotionally and physically.
    - Powerful character, but falls into the “thankless backbone” cliché.

  6. Secret Softie (Low Risk)
    - Example: Langdon presents as brusque, but has a hidden moral core.
    - Effectively written but conventional.

  7. The Shadow Mentor (Low Risk)
    - Example: Dr. Adamson, deceased, influences Robby from memory.
    - Archetypal role, elevated by emotional integration in the narrative.

  8. Stoic Sufferer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Collins hides miscarriage, returns to work immediately.
    - Realistic, but echoes a recurring “selfless woman” trope.

  9. Overbearing Parent (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Javadi’s mother pressures her both personally and professionally.
    - Relatable but overly familiar dramatic device.

 10. Unexpected Parent Reveal (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Kristi’s “mother” is actually her aunt.
    - Emotional twist with dramatic stakes, but trope-standard reveal.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

 11. One Day to Change Everything (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The entire season spans a single extended shift.
    - Structurally bold, but reminiscent of “24”-style compression gimmicks.

 12. Crisis as Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - Example: Pitt Fest shooting brings every unresolved plotline to a head.
    - High-stakes but typical of climactic drama escalation.

 13. Work-Life Boundary Collapse (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Robby’s personal connections bleed into professional decisions.
    - Integral to workplace dramas but predictable.

 14. Systemic Failure Pressure Cooker (Low Risk)
    - Example: Underfunding, lack of staff, and politics drive interpersonal conflict.
    - Resonant and socially grounded, even if familiar.

 15. Redemption Through Crisis (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Langdon returns during the mass casualty event, trying to redeem himself.
    - Familiar trope of flawed character “earning” their way back.

 16. Child in Peril (Low Risk)
    - Example: Amber’s death, Flynn’s measles, and Jake’s emotional collapse.
    - Heavy emotional material, but frequently used in prestige dramas.

 17. Abortion Under Fire (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Kristi’s abortion is contested, delayed, and nearly prevented.
    - Relevant and timely, but the framing is archetypal.

 18. Surprise Addiction Reveal (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Langdon's locker search uncovers theft and drug abuse.
    - Common twist used to shake up audience expectations of authority figures.

 19. Shooter/Disaster as Moral Reset (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Pitt Fest shooting repositions nearly every character.
    - High drama often uses violence as thematic linchpin.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

 20. Time-Locked Structure (Low Risk)
    - Example: Each episode covers a literal hour of a continuous 15-hour shift.
    - Ambitious and effective, but recalls real-time formats in other dramas.

 21. Gritty Realism Through Multicam (Low Risk)
    - Example: Multi-camera and handheld styles create high-stress immersion.
    - Tactile and grounded, if genre-consistent.

 22. Flashbacks for Internal Collapse (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Robby’s memories of the COVID pandemic frequently trigger breakdowns.
    - Emotional shorthand technique, deployed effectively but predictably.

 23. Surgical Close-Ups (Low Risk)
    - Example: Emergency procedures like cricothyrotomy and REBOA shown in intimate detail.
    - A staple of medical TV, effective but not novel.

 24. Procedural Cutaways to Dying Patients (Low Risk)
    - Example: Montage sequences of trauma, interventions, and death.
    - Visceral but expected in emergency room storytelling.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

 25. Rat in the Hospital (Low Risk)
    - Example: A homeless man unleashes rats, a literal infestation of the system’s neglect.
    - Absurdist but also literalizing thematic decay.

 26. Honor Walk for Organ Donor (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nick’s walk mirrors real-life practice but used as emotional high point.
    - Earnest but slightly sentimentalized.

 27. First Responder Trauma Relived (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Leah’s death evokes Adamson’s loss, catalyzing Robby’s breakdown.
    - High-stakes psychological echo common to trauma-centered protagonists.

 28. Physical Violence Against Staff (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dana is punched by Doug, then continues working.
    - Reflects real risks but risks becoming a “martyr for the cause” beat.

 29. The Last Scene Cliffhanger as Healing Gesture (Low Risk)
    - Example: Robby joins colleagues for a beer in the park after near suicide.
    - Subtle, symbolic moment to imply resilience—classic but effective closer.

Edit
Severance is an American science fiction psychological thriller television series created by Dan Erickson, and executive produced and primarily directed by Ben Stiller. It stars Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Jen Tullock, Dichen Lachman, Michael Chernus, John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Sarah Bock and Patricia Arquette. The series follows employees at the biotechnology corporation Lumon Industries that have undergone "severance"—a medical procedure that ensures they retain no memories of the outside world while at work, and have no recollection of their job once they leave. This results in two distinct personalities for each employee: the "innie", who exists solely within Lumon, and the "outie", who lives their personal life outside of work.

1	1	"Good News About Hell"	Ben Stiller	Dan Erickson	February 18, 2022
Mark Scout, who works in Lumon Industries' Macrodata Refinement (MDR) department, discovers he is being promoted to department head in light of his coworker Petey's sudden departure. His first task is to orient Helly, the replacement, who wakes up in a conference room with no memory of who or where she is. After being given an orientation and learning her name, she demands and is allowed to leave, but finds she is unable. She watches a video explaining that she has undergone the "severance" procedure, which split her memories to create a version of herself that will only exist inside the workplace. The "outside" version of Mark, a former professor grieving his wife Gemma's death and living in the Lumon-subsidized town of Kier, encounters Petey, who claims to have reversed his supposedly-permanent severance. Mark returns home and interacts with his neighbor "Mrs. Selvig", unaware that she is his senior manager Harmony Cobel.
2	2	"Half Loop"	Ben Stiller	Dan Erickson	February 18, 2022
The previous day, Helly undergoes the severance procedure as a new employee, implanting a microchip inside her brain. At the office, the severed (or "innie") Helly is introduced to her coworkers, Dylan and Irving, and is instructed that her job is to sort encrypted numbers into categories. During a welcome party headed by deputy floor manager Seth Milchick, Helly attempts to escape by writing her outside self (or "outie") a resignation note, but the elevator shuts down due to Lumon's built-in "code detectors", which prevent unauthorized communication between selves. Mark claims responsibility and is put into the "break room" as punishment. Irving hallucinates and sees a black liquid covering his desk and is administered a "wellness check", where counselor Ms. Casey recites vague facts about Irving's outie, with Irving forced to react neutrally. At the wellness center, Irving meets Burt, head of the two-person Optics & Design (O&D) department. Outside, Petey explains he has "reintegration sickness" from reversing his severance. Petey tells Mark of the break room, and plays a recording of Mark being forced by Milchick to repeatedly recite a stringent apology. Mark gives Petey shelter in his house. While taking a shower, Petey hallucinates and collapses.
3	3	"In Perpetuity"	Ben Stiller	Andrew Colville	February 25, 2022
Petey tells Mark that mysterious benefactors helped him undergo the reintegration procedure. While Mark is at work, his sister Devon and brother-in-law Ricken deliver the latter's self-help book, The You You Are, to his doorstep, which Cobel steals and takes to Lumon to check for hidden messages. As she searches Mark's house, Petey recognizes her and flees, suffering more hallucinations and eventually collapsing at a convenience store. At the office, Helly learns her resignation request sent to her outie has been denied. Mark thwarts her various attempts to smuggle other messages to her outie. To help Helly understand why she is working at Lumon, Irving suggests they show her the office's Perpetuity Wing, which documents the history of Lumon's founder, Kier Eagan, and his succeeding dynasty. After attempting another escape, Helly is taken to the break room, where Milchick forces her to repeatedly recite an apologetic passage. Near his shift's end, Mark finds a hand-drawn map of Lumon's hallways left for him by Petey. After work, Mark follows ambulance traffic to the convenience store and witnesses Petey being carried away by paramedics. Mark rushes home to hide evidence of Petey's stay, but is interrupted when Petey's abandoned cellphone rings.
4	4	"The You You Are"	Aoife McArdle	Kari Drake	March 4, 2022
Mark stashes away Petey's phone, noticing several missed calls from the same blocked number. The next day, Irving visits O&D, where he grows closer to Burt. He discovers Ricken's book, left behind by Milchick. Mark keeps the book, despite promising to give it to management. Helly returns from the break room after being forced to apologize over a thousand times. Mark shreds Petey's map after it is found by Helly. Helly finds a paper cutter and threatens self-mutilation unless she is granted a recorded resignation request. However, her outie sends back a recording firmly denying both the request and her innie's personhood. Later that night, Mark receives a news notification reporting that Petey has died. Mark and Cobel (as Mrs. Selvig) attend the funeral, during which Cobel secretly extracts Petey's severance chip. She then has Ms. Casey perform a "special" wellness session on Mark. Casey has Mark sculpt his emotional state out of clay; Mark sculpts a tree, which his outie visited in remembrance of Gemma after Petey's funeral. Irving discovers that O&D actually has at least seven employees, working in a massive unlabelled back room. Helly smuggles out an extension cord and hangs herself in an elevator.
5	5	"The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design"	Aoife McArdle	Anna Ouyang Moench	March 11, 2022
Helly is injured by her suicide attempt, but ultimately survives; she returns to work three days later. Mark continues to read Ricken's book, which carries strong anti-establishment sentiments. Outside work, Mark visits Devon and Ricken at a birthing lodge, where Devon gives birth. When Helly returns, Cobel orders Ms. Casey to watch her closely, but Mark sneaks Helly out of MDR and reveals he has been recreating Petey's map. When Mark tries to convince Helly to help with recreating the map, she initially refuses, but eventually agrees. Burt admits to Irving and Dylan that he lied about the size of O&D due to MDR being seen as untrustworthy; they realize Lumon is pitting the departments against one another. Burt takes the two to O&D's back room and introduces them to his employees.
6	6	"Hide and Seek"	Aoife McArdle	Amanda Overton	March 18, 2022
Lumon security chief Doug Graner informs Cobel that he has identified ex-employee Reghabi as responsible for Petey's reintegration. Irving and Burt admit their feelings to one another, but Irving admits he is not ready to commit to a relationship. Mark has Irving introduce MDR to O&D, where he calls for the departments to work together to uncover Lumon's secrets. However, Milchick finds them and sends Mark to the break room. Milchick later briefly awakens Dylan's innie inside his outie's home to locate a card Dylan stole from O&D, leading Dylan's innie to discover he has a son. Cobel (as Mrs. Selvig) gets close to Devon and Ricken by acting as their lactation consultant. Mark goes on a date with Alexa, Devon's midwife, to a concert by Petey's daughter's punk-rock band, and sings along to an anti-Lumon protest song. Later, Mark finally answers Petey's phone and is contacted by Reghabi to meet at a nearby university. Cobel orders a keycard-locked door to be installed at the entrance to MDR.
7	7	"Defiant Jazz"	Ben Stiller	Helen Leigh	March 25, 2022
While Mark is meeting with Reghabi, Graner enters the building—following a tip from campus security. Reghabi kills Graner and gives Mark his access card, telling him to take it to his innie. Milchick engages in a "Music Dance Experience" with the department as a prize for Helly; Dylan refuses to participate and eventually attacks Milchick, enraged that he cannot know more about his child. After Milchick leaves, Dylan tells the rest of MDR about Lumon's ability to wake them up outside the severed floor, known as the "overtime contingency". The MDR team uses Graner's card to regain access to the hallways. Mark and Helly scheme to find the security office; inside, they find out how the overtime contingency is activated. Dylan offers to stay behind after hours to wake the others up on the outside. Irving departs to O&D, worried about Burt's safety. Upon arrival, he discovers that Burt is retiring, and openly berates the non-severed Milchick for exploiting the severed employees. After work, Alexa visits a drunken Mark, who scares her off after ripping up a photo of Gemma. After she leaves, Mark reassembles the photo, revealing it to be Ms. Casey.
8	8	"What's for Dinner?"	Ben Stiller	Chris Black	April 1, 2022
Irving's outie lives alone in an apartment, where he paints identical images of a dark corridor. Helly reaches 100% on her data refinement file, thereby meeting MDR's quota for the quarter. After a final wellness session with Mark, Ms. Casey is ordered by Cobel to be sent back down to the "testing floor", whose entrance matches Irving's paintings. While MDR celebrates quota, Cobel is suspended by Lumon's board for withholding knowledge of Helly's suicide attempt and her avocational activities as "Mrs. Selvig". The MDR team prepares for Dylan to remotely awaken them on the outside; Helly kisses Mark before departing. Mark's outie attends Ricken's book-reading party and tells "Mrs. Selvig" that he plans to quit Lumon; she encourages him to do so. Dylan receives a "waffle party" as a reward for meeting quota, in which he dons a Kier Eagan mask and sits within a replica of Kier's bedroom in the Perpetuity Wing while ritualistic and seductive dances are performed in front of him. Dylan leaves midway to access the security office and activates the overtime contingency to awaken Mark, Irving, and Helly's innies in the outside world.
9	9	"The We We Are"	Ben Stiller	Dan Erickson	April 8, 2022
Mark's innie awakens in Devon's home and finds himself hugging "Mrs. Selvig". While excusing himself to find Devon, he calls Cobel by name, alerting her that the overtime contingency has been activated. Cobel calls Milchick to warn him. Mark privately reveals to Devon that he is his innie; Devon tells him of Gemma's death and learns that "Mrs. Selvig" is Mark's boss. Irving wakes up in his apartment, discovering his outie's paintings, and finds a map and employee directory which he uses to locate Burt. Helly wakes up at a Lumon gala where she learns that her outie is Helena Eagan—daughter of Lumon CEO Jame Eagan—who underwent severance as a publicity stunt. Cobel races to the gala and attempts to stop Helly from making a scheduled speech. Helly gets onstage and tells the crowd of the innies' subjugation and torment. Irving arrives at Burt's house only to find Burt is already in a relationship. Mark finds a photo showing Ms. Casey to be Gemma. He rushes to tell Devon, but is only able to say "She's alive!" before Milchick tackles Dylan, deactivating the overtime contingency and reverting the three to their outies.

10	1	"Hello, Ms. Cobel"	Ben Stiller	Dan Erickson	January 16, 2025
Mark reawakens on the severed floor in a panic, finding Ms. Casey's wellness room decommissioned, and his whole team replaced. Milchick, now running the severed floor, introduces Mark to new deputy manager Miss Huang—a child—and claims that five months have passed since the "Macrodat Uprising", which supposedly made Mark's team the faces of "severance reform". Milchick says that while Mark's outie asked to return to Lumon, the other three refused. Mark sabotages his new team as a distraction to reach the board and request the other innies' return. The next time Mark wakes up on the severed floor, he reunites with Dylan, Irving, and Helly. The four are taken to a renovated Break Room, where Milchick promises better working conditions and offers the innies a choice to leave permanently or stay. Mark informs the group what he learned while outside, while Helly lies about her outie's identity. A distraught Irving nearly leaves over his heartbreak at Burt having a partner, but Dylan convinces him to stay. Milchick privately shows Dylan blueprints for an outie family visitation suite. Having all chosen to stay, the team resumes its work.
11	2	"Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig"	Sam Donovan	Mohamad El Masri	January 23, 2025
Following the Overtime Contingency, Milchick is tasked with damage control and fires both Irving and Dylan; Irving lies to Milchick about his whereabouts that night. Helena, accompanied by security chief Mr. Drummond, meets with Cobel and offers her a promotion as a reward for her loyalty, but Cobel is insulted at not being offered her old job back. Helena films an apology video passing off her outburst at the gala as the result of intoxication. Milchick attempts to convince Mark to return to work, but Mark decides to quit, much to the dismay of Devon, who is concerned that Gemma is alive. Dylan attempts to find a new job but is discriminated against for being severed. Helena insists that Mark must return to work to finish his latest file, "Cold Harbor"; Milchick convinces him to return by offering him a hefty pay raise and promises that the happiness his innie receives will trickle back to him. After hearing Mark's plea to the board, Milchick rehires Dylan and Irving, while the board decides to send Helena back to work. Mark runs into Cobel while returning home and demands answers about Gemma, but she angrily drives off.
12	3	"Who Is Alive?"	Ben Stiller	Wei-Ning Yu	January 30, 2025
Mark and Helly go to hand out missing-persons posters of Ms. Casey across the severed floor. The two stumble upon the Mammalians Nurturable department, led by a woman named Lorne; though initially hostile, the Mammalians promise not to hinder MDR's search for Ms. Casey. Irving takes a missing poster to O&D, where he runs into Felicia, who identifies his sketch of the dark hallway from his outie's paintings as the "Exports Hall". Dylan is granted a visitation with his outie's wife, Gretchen. Natalie approaches Ricken to discuss adapting The You You Are for innies. Cobel agrees to rejoin Lumon on the condition that she is rehired as Floor Manager. Helena instead suggests an impromptu meeting with the board, prompting a spooked Cobel to drive off. Mark and Devon attempt to burn an afterimage into his retinas to communicate with his innie; Reghabi interrupts Mark, telling him his strategy will not work, and that reintegration is the only way to send messages in and out of Lumon. Mark agrees to the procedure after Reghabi confirms his wife is alive. As they begin conducting the process in Mark's basement, Mark flashes between the present and his orientation on the severed floor.

MDR find themselves in the outside world on a frozen lake. A prerecorded message from Milchick informs them that they are on an "Outdoor Retreat and Team-Building Occurrence" (ORTBO), and directs them to find the previously unrevealed fourth appendix to the Lumon handbook, written by Kier Eagan, by following the directions of strange doppelgängers of themselves. Upon taking the appendix to Woe's Hollow, a waterfall, they are greeted by Milchick and Miss Huang, who have set up a campsite. Helly is confronted by Irving about her suspicious account of her time during the Overtime Contingency. She retorts by claiming Irving is bitter about Burt's retirement, causing Irving to storm off. Helly and Mark have sex, after which Mark briefly hallucinates Gemma's head on Helly's body. Irving sleeps outside, experiencing strange dreams. The next morning, Irving again confronts Helly. To force her to admit she is a mole, he yells for Milchick and begins drowning Helly in Woe's Hollow. Helly reverts to her innie after calling Milchick by his first name, Seth, which is unknown to the MDR, telling him to do it. Milchick then fires Irving and reverts him to his outie.

Following the ORTBO, a reluctant Helena is compelled to continue working on the severed floor as her innie until Mark completes the Cold Harbor file. Milchick fulfills Dylan's demand for a funeral for Irving. During the ceremony, Dylan realizes that Irving's final words to him reference a Break Room poster. Behind it, he discovers a card with directions to the Exports Hall, but quickly hides it again. Helly learns that Ms. Casey is Mark's outie's wife, and Mark tells her he cannot trust her. Milchick undergoes his first performance review as department head, where Drummond admonishes his failed kindness reforms, demanding that the innies be treated "as what they really are". Milchick confronts Mark, revealing he knows that Mark and Helena had sex during the retreat. Ricken begins work on the Lumon edition of The You You Are, laden with company propaganda, to Devon's dismay. Irving's outie notices Burt watching him. Burt admits he has been following him since the Overtime Contingency and theorizes that they were romantically involved on the severed floor. He invites Irving to dinner with his husband, Fields. Mark, in a sudden flash to the severed floor while at home, sees Gemma alive as Ms. Casey.

She later lies to outie Dylan that the visitation was cancelled. Burt and Fields have Irving for dinner, and an awkward conversation unfolds. Meanwhile, Drummond breaks into Irving's apartment and discovers his directory of Lumon employees. Reghabi tells Mark they must accelerate the reintegration process by surgically "flooding" his severance chip, despite the risk of hemorrhage. Mark initially refuses but later encounters Helena at a restaurant; he leaves shortly after and decides to proceed with the procedure. While talking to Devon right after the procedure, Mark suffers a seizure and collapses.

After a miscarriage, Gemma and Mark visit a fertility clinic run by Lumon. In the present, Gemma lives on the testing floor at Lumon, where every day she visits multiple rooms (which share the names of the MDR files) that awaken a separate innie forced to endure a certain unpleasant experience, overseen by Dr. Mauer. After she leaves the rooms, Mauer interviews her about her memories and emotions from the experiences. Meanwhile, as Mark lies unconscious, Reghabi confirms to Devon that Gemma is alive, and tells her Mark is voluntarily reintegrating. Reghabi leaves when Devon suggests calling Cobel for help. On the testing floor, when Gemma tells Mauer she wants to leave, he lies by saying that Mark remarried and had a child. Gemma knocks Mauer unconscious and steals his keycard. She attempts to escape via the elevator to the severed floor, but reverts to Ms. Casey, and Milchick redirects her back down the elevator. Mark awakens with Devon beside him, still recalling memories of Gemma.

Harmony's mother Charlotte died after a long illness while Harmony was at a Lumon boarding school, leaving Harmony's aunt[17] Sissy, a Lumon devotee, in charge of the home. Harmony barges into the house against Sissy's protests and falls asleep crying on Charlotte's old bed. Hampton finds her and they take ether. In the outdoor storeroom, Harmony finds her yearbook and her sketches of the severance procedure and chip, proving she was in fact the true inventor. Sissy attempts to burn the pages, but Harmony saves them and drives off in Hampton's truck as a car approaches the house.

Helly and Dylan trap Milchick in the MDR bathroom while Mark searches for the hallway to the testing floor. In the Cold Harbor room, Gemma is tasked with disassembling a crib; she responds without emotion, to Dr. Mauer's and Jame Eagan's delight. Drummond summons Lorne to sacrifice a goat, but discovers Mark attempting to break into the Exports Hall. He tries to kill Mark but is subdued by Lorne. Mark takes Drummond hostage, but accidentally kills him in the testing floor elevator during the transition to his outie.

Mark guides Gemma through the exit door but chooses to return to Helly; the two run through the hallways as an emergency alarm blares.
Production
edit
Development
edit

Ben Stiller is the primary director and one of the executive producers.
Erickson conceived of Severance in a period of depression working an office job at a door factory after he had completed his master's degree in television writing.[23][24] He found the job so monotonous that he wished he could "skip the eight hours of the workday, to disassociate and just get it over with".[25]
Erickson submitted his pilot script to Ben Stiller's production company Red Hour Productions in 2015, and it was passed to Stiller by the development executive Jackie Cohn.[26] Stiller read it at least five years before Severance premiered, and said the project was "the longest thing I've ever worked on". He said he enjoyed the story's contributions to the workplace comedy.[27] Erickson has described his earlier versions of the pilot as "weirder" and containing many stray elements with no backstory such as a disembodied pair of legs running by Mark, a charred floor with burnt desks, and a woman trapped in a glass cubicle. Erickson credits Stiller with grounding the show, saying "he felt that the concept was weird enough that you didn't have to throw a bunch of other Terry Gilliam-esque bells and whistles at it."[28] According to Erickson, "Ben fell in love with the part of the show that was this weird human sadness of a person who would willingly do this to himself."[29]
In November 2019, Apple TV+ gave Severance a series order, with Stiller directing and Scott in the leading role.[30] Stiller was only attached to direct the pilot, but decided to direct more episodes as the series entered development.[31] On April 6, 2022, Apple renewed the series for a second season.[32] In April 2023, it was reported that Beau Willimon had been hired as an executive producer and writer for the second and potential third seasons.[33] On March 21, 2025, shortly after the premiere of the season 2 finale, Apple announced the renewal of the series for a third season.[34] The Writers Guild of America West database lists new showrunners Eli Jorne and Mary Laws alongside Erickson for the third season, replacing Chris Black and Mark Friedman, who showran the first two seasons alongside Erickson.[22]
Writing
edit
Media that influenced Severance include the Backrooms creepypasta, the 2013 video game The Stanley Parable, films including Office Space, The Truman Show, Being John Malkovich, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the Black Mirror episode "White Christmas", and the comic strip Dilbert.[35][36][37][38] Older influences include the existential hell in the 1944 Jean-Paul Sartre play No Exit and the totalitarian dystopia in the 1949 George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.[39] Aesthetically, the series was influenced by the films Brazil, Dark City, and Playtime.[40] Erickson's siblings inspired some of the characters.[41] In 2016, his screenplay for the pilot of Severance appeared on Blood List's survey results of the best unproduced genre screenplays.[42]
Erickson said: "The same frustrations that led us to this moment as a country [United States] and as a world are the ones that I was feeling when I wrote this because I was working office jobs, and I was dealing with all these increasingly insane requests that are made of workers. This was born of that ... Employees are the ones who are expected to give and give and give, with the understanding that this is a family—you're doing this out of love, but then that is often not returned by the employers in any kind of a substantive way."[43]
Casting
edit
In January 2017, Stiller invited Adam Scott to star.[44] Stiller and Scott had previously worked together in Stiller's 2013 movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.[26]
In January 2020, Patricia Arquette,[45] Britt Lower,[46] Jen Tullock, and Zach Cherry were added to the cast.[47] Tramell Tillman joined in February 2020,[48] and John Turturro and Christopher Walken were added in November 2020.[49][50] Dichen Lachman was cast in December 2020.[51] Turturro said he recommended Walken for the role of Burt because he had known him for "a long time and I don't have to really act".[52]
On October 31, 2022, Gwendoline Christie, Bob Balaban, Merritt Wever, Alia Shawkat, Robby Benson, Stefano Carannante, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, and John Noble were announced to have joined the cast for season two.[53] Stiller offered former U.S. President Barack Obama a voice cameo role in the second season, but he declined; the role eventually went to Keanu Reeves.[54]
Set design
edit
Production designer Jeremy Hindle blended corporate looks from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s for the show's distinctive look, and cited modernist architect Eero Saarinen as influential for the building design.[55] This included the John Deere World Headquarters in Moline, Illinois, and the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex in New Jersey (the latter which served as both the exterior shots and the ground floor interiors for Lumon Industries), both buildings designed as "work designed to do work" according to Hindle.[56] The set designs of Playtime also served as inspiration for the internal sets.[56] The main sets for Severance were created on soundstages in The Bronx. One soundstage was used for the hallways within Lumon, using around 140 feet (43 m) of hallway that they would rearrange as necessary, along with special effects, to create the maze-like structure. Another soundstage used larger hallways that were used in latter episodes of the first season.[56] A second soundstage was used for main rooms like the Macrodata Refinement Division. This space was designed to create the feeling of being trapped, using a large room (80 by 40 feet (24 m × 12 m)) with a low ceiling. Hindle also felt this room was meant to be a playroom for the newest Lumon hires, and gave it green carpeting in contrast with the whites to make it feel like grass.[56] Other spaces with Lumon were inspired by the works of M.C. Escher.[56]

A Lumon-themed vending machine as seen in the show.
Erickson said the mix of cars and technologies from different eras was meant to "give a slight sense of disorientation" and make Lumon "feel unmoored from time and space".[57][58] To this end, the production team sourced an anachronistic collection of 400 cars, largely commonplace boxy vehicles from the 1980s and 1990s, all in relatively good condition. Each car, even in the far background, was intentionally placed to curate the retro science fiction aesthetic. Characters' vehicles, chosen to show more of who they are, include Mark's Volvo S90, Cobel's Volkswagen Rabbit, Helena's Lincoln Continental, and Milchick's Royal Enfield motorcycle.[59] All the office equipment carries Lumon branding.[56] The prop designers reconstructed old computers with functional trackball devices so the actors could perform the work presented on the show in order to get adjusted to the office setting.[60][56] The computers lacked an escape key, as a metaphor for the lack of control the innies have while in Lumon's offices.[61] The computer terminals were modeled from the Data General Dasher terminals from the 1970s and the keycaps were recreated by Signature Plastics, who also made the original keycaps for the 1970s Dasher terminals. The keycap set was re-released in 2025 under the name "SA Macrodata Refinement".[62][63]
Filming
edit

The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex in central New Jersey, U.S., stood in for the headquarters of Lumon Industries and has become a popular social media and tourist attraction.[64]
The COVID-19 pandemic postponed the initial production start of March 2020.[27] Principal photography for the first season started in New York City under the working title Tumwater on November 8, 2020.[65][66] The opening scene of the show was shot on January 6, 2021.[66] The series filmed for a few days in February in Nyack, New York for the homes of Mark and Cobel, and in Kingston and Beacon, New York in March.[56][67][68] In April, filming moved to central New Jersey, mainly in the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex which stood in for Lumon HQ.[64][69][55] Filming was scheduled to conclude on June 23, 2021.[70]
The second season began filming on October 3, 2022, in New York City, and was set to wrap on May 12, 2023. However, on May 8, 2023, production of the season was shut down due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[71] Production had resumed by May 13, 2023, with filming occurring in Newfoundland.[72] Filming was later shut down again due to both the actors strike and the writers strike, but resumed on January 29, 2024,[73] and wrapped on April 23, 2024.[74]

Season	Rotten Tomatoes	Metacritic
1	97% (117 reviews)[76]	83 (36 reviews)[77]
2	95% (212 reviews)[78]	86 (43 reviews)[21]
Both seasons of Severance have received critical acclaim. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the overall series holds an approval rating of 96%.[79] Meanwhile, on Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the overall series has received a score of 85 out of 100.[80]
Season 1
edit




The performances of the cast garnered critical acclaim, with Adam Scott, Patricia Arquette, John Turturro and Christopher Walken (pictured) earning Primetime Emmy Award nominations.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of Severance has an approval rating of 97% based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Audacious, mysterious, and bringing fresh insight into the perils of corporate drudgery, Severance is the complete package."[76] Metacritic assigned a score of 83 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[77]
The series received a rating of five out of five from Lucy Mangan of The Guardian and Rachael Sigee of I,[81][82] 4 out of 5 stars from Huw Fullerton of Radio Times, John Nugent of Empire, Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone and Anita Singh of The Telegraph,[83][84][85][86] and 3.5 out of 4 stars from Patrick Ryan of USA Today.[87] In her review, Mangan praised Stiller's direction, the writing, and the performances of the cast (particularly those of Arquette, Turturro, Walken, and Tillman).[81] Sigee also praised the performances, especially Scott's, Arquette's, Turturro's and Walken's, and wrote, "Severance moves slowly but surely, allowing time to absorb both the impressive world-building and stunning visuals, [...] [and] its breathtaking cinematography and design. With an exceptional cast [...], this is an original, weird, thought-provoking and beautifully crafted story that asks just how much of ourselves we should give over to our jobs." Fullerton also praised Scott's performance and called the series "an impressive creation".[82] Nugent praised the direction, performances of Scott, Arquette, Turturro and Walken, and chemistry between the latter two.[84] Sepinwall also praised Stiller's direction and the cast's performances (most notably those of Scott, Turturro, Walken, Lower and Tillman), in addition to the production design, tone, and season finale.[86]
Grading the series an "A", Carly Lane of Collider wrote, "the most engrossing element of Severance is the many mysteries it presents, wrapped up in silent overarching questions of philosophy, morality, and free will versus choice, and as the series demonstrates, some of those questions aren't so easily solved, but some issues aren't as black-and-white as initially presented either."[88] Also grading it an "A", Ben Travers of IndieWire wrote, "Whether you invest in the allegory, character arcs, or both, 'Severance' hits its marks. [...] Erickson and his writing staff deserve a ton of credit. The season plays out cleanly and efficiently; episodes range from nearly 60 minutes to a crisp 40; cliffhangers abound, but they're earned. [...] This is serialized storytelling that knows how to make the most of its episodic format."[89] Stephen Robinson of The A.V. Club gave it an "A-" grade and praised Stiller's direction and the cast, with the performances of Lower, Scott, Tillman, Turturro, Walken, Tullock and Cherry singled out.[90] For Entertainment Weekly, Kristen Baldwin graded it a "B+" and highlighted the performances of Scott, Lower and Tillman, writing, "Scott is a superb fit for Severance's central everyman, [...] Lower brings an effective vulnerability to the acerbic Helly, and Tramell Tillman is an absolute force of charisma as Milchick."[5]
Giving the series a score of nine out of ten, Samantha Nelson of IGN wrote, "Severance [...] uses a clever premise and excellent cast to set up an intriguing mystery that leaves plenty of room for the characters to evolve."[91] Writing for Paste, Shane Ryan gave it an 8.1 out of 10 and praised the performances of Scott, Arquette and Tillman as well as Stiller and McArdle's direction.[92] Kyle Mullin of Under the Radar gave it eight out of ten and said, "Severance's writer/creator Dan Erickson is another newcomer who pens scenes with veteran-level aplomb. Every scene is a Golden Age of TV gem in its own right. But Severance's dramatic heart resides at the workplace, where it also becomes a white-knuckle thriller. This is where director Ben Stiller especially shines, training his lens and setting the scenes [...]. He certainly brings the best out of his cast."[93]
The American Film Institute named it one of the ten best television programs of the year.[94]
Season 2
edit
The second season has an approval rating of 95% based on 212 reviews and an average rating of 8.9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes. The website's consensus reads: "Masterfully managing its two halves of adroit character study and surreal nightmare, Severance's long-awaited sophomore season makes cognitive dissonance a mind-melting pleasure."[78] Metacritic assigned a score of 86 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[21]
Writing for Variety, Alison Herman awarded the second season with a perfect rating, noting: "Season 2 fulfills this sine qua non with deceptive ease. Real-time viewers have had their patience strained; future binge-watchers will barely notice a blip."[95] John Nugent of Empire gave season two 4 stars out of 5, while stating: "After a storming Season One, Season Two expands and deepens the original mysteries while opening up new ones. Sharply made and skilfully executed, the employee benefits are there if you stay with it."[96]

Severance (Erickson, 2022–2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Dual Identity Crisis (Low Risk)
    - Example: Innies and outies possess separate lives, personalities, and values.
    - Central concept, deployed with thematic rigor; not cliché in this case.

  2. The Amnesiac Protagonist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Innies like Helly and Mark begin their story arcs with no memory or agency.
    - Common in sci-fi, though used here as philosophical rather than narrative gimmick.

  3. Cold Bureaucratic Villain (Low Risk)
    - Example: Cobel is composed, manipulative, and loyal to Lumon—until she fractures.
    - Arguably archetypal, but given depth and tragic nuance.

  4. The Repressed Rebel (Low Risk)
    - Example: Mark outwardly conforms but gradually leads the insurrection.
    - A classic construction but emotionally justified and well-paced.

  5. Charismatic Enforcer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Milchick is charming yet quietly menacing, bridging warmth and terror.
    - A trope archetype, but freshened by his contradictory behavior and limits.

  6. The Sadistic Shrink (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ms. Casey, then Dr. Mauer, run emotion-control protocols with disturbing detachment.
    - Common in dystopias, but serves psychological inquiry here.

  7. Forbidden Love in a System of Control (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Irving and Burt’s romance blossoms in secret under strict surveillance.
    - Familiar but humanizing; effective metaphor for suppressed individuality.

  8. The Reformer Who Becomes a Symbol (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Helly’s innie is unknowingly used by Helena (her outie) as a PR stunt.
    - Reflects political archetypes; subversive because of its moral inversion.

  9. Grief as Motivation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Mark’s outie chooses severance to escape his wife’s death.
    - Deeply felt but follows a familiar grief-driven protagonist arc.

 10. The Secret Savior (Low Risk)
    - Example: Reghabi reintegrates Petey, helps Mark, and resists Lumon quietly.
    - A common trope for underground helpers; portrayed with grounded realism.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

 11. Dystopia as Workplace Satire (Low Risk)
    - Example: Lumon Industries blends totalitarian horror with banal corporate routine.
    - Deep genre lineage, but handled with originality and restraint.

 12. The Cult of the Founder (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Kier Eagan is worshipped through bizarre rituals and company dogma.
    - Well-executed corporate cult cliché, complete with ideological absurdity.

 13. Memory as Resistance (Low Risk)
    - Example: Painting, smuggled maps, and dreams become means of rebellion.
    - Strong thematic payoff justifies the trope's use.

 14. The Escape That Backfires (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Innie awakenings in the outside world lead to chaos and trauma.
    - Reverse of “successful jailbreak” trope; offers dramatic irony.

 15. The Secret Romance as Catalyst (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Irving’s pursuit of Burt becomes a primary motive across seasons.
    - Familiar emotional thread used well to deepen stakes.

 16. False Savior Corporation (Low Risk)
    - Example: Lumon markets severance as personal liberation while systemically enslaving.
    - Corporate dystopia standard, but richly rendered.

 17. Contingency Protocol Plot Device (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Overtime activation, Break Room punishments, and ORTBO events.
    - Genre-typical mechanisms, though repurposed with philosophical intent.

 18. Sacrifice as Narrative Fuel (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Characters like Dylan, Ms. Casey, and ultimately Mark suffer to awaken others.
    - Familiar trajectory, elevated by internal logic and stakes.

 19. The Secret Message Hidden in Mundane Object (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Break Room poster conceals directions to Exports Hall.
    - Traditional spy-thriller trick, dressed here in eerie abstraction.

 20. The Impossible Escape (Low Risk)
    - Example: Innies try to leave, only to revert or be recaptured mid-act.
    - Classic trap motif, presented with brutal inevitability.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

 21. Maze-Like Architecture (Low Risk)
    - Example: Labyrinthine hallways disorient employees and viewers alike.
    - Symbolic and unsettling; a standout in visual metaphor.

 22. Sterile Surrealism (Low Risk)
    - Example: Uniformity of office design echoes Orwell and Escher.
    - Aestheticized trope that reinforces the psychological tone.

 23. Color-Coded Spaces (Low Risk)
    - Example: Distinct departments and floor changes use lighting shifts and visual separation.
    - Visual storytelling standard, executed with surgical precision.

 24. Mirror Framing (Low Risk)
    - Example: Repeated shots of innies and outies in similar poses underscore duality.
    - A conventional cinematic device used for thematic reinforcement.

 25. Surveillance as Visual Grammar (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Static security cameras, limited angles, and voyeuristic staging.
    - Visually familiar but essential to tone and mood.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

 26. Waffle Party Ritual (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Surreal sexualized celebration used to control behavior.
    - Absurdist corporate rite; a satire of HR "perks" gone nightmarish.

 27. The Unseen Board (Low Risk)
    - Example: Lumon’s directors are literally voiceless, speaking through intermediaries.
    - Classic unseen overlords; enriched by layers of absurdity.

 28. The Rebel is the System (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Helly's outie *is* a board member using herself as a guinea pig.
    - Familiar inversion trope, but emotionally effective.

 29. The Emergency Alarm Climax (Low Risk)
    - Example: Final sequence with Gemma’s escape and red sirens flashing.
    - Standard thriller closeout beat, intensified by emotional and thematic stakes.

 30. Titles as Thematic Echoes (Low Risk)
    - Example: Cold Harbor, Woe’s Hollow, Sweet Vitriol.
    - Naming convention ties to philosophical motifs—used with subtlety.

The Punisher
Daredevil: Born Again
Charlie Cox stars as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime as a masked vigilante by night. Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Rosario Dawson, and Vincent D'Onofrio also star, with Toby Leonard Moore, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Bob Gunton, and Ayelet Zurer joining them for season one, Jon Bernthal, Élodie Yung, and Stephen Rider joining the cast for season two, and Joanne Whalley, Jay Ali and Wilson Bethel joining in season three. Daredevil entered development in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. Cox was cast in May 2014, and the Daredevil costume was designed by Ryan Meinerding of Marvel Studios' design team. The series was intended to be darker than other Marvel projects, intentionally avoiding crossovers with the wider MCU and focusing on a crime fiction style that was inspired by 1970s films. Design inspiration was taken from the Hell's Kitchen setting of the comics, with filming taking place in New York City.
The first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on April 10, 2015, followed by the second on March 18, 2016, and the third on October 19, 2018. They were met with positive reviews, and received numerous accolades including several nominations for Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. A spin-off series centered on Bernthal's character Frank Castle / Punisher, titled The Punisher, was ordered by Netflix in April 2016. Netflix canceled Daredevil on November 29, 2018. It, along with the rest of Netflix's Marvel series, was moved from Netflix to Disney+ in March 2022 after Disney regained the license. Beginning in 2021, Cox and D'Onofrio reprised their roles as Murdock and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin in MCU projects produced by Marvel Studios, including a revival series for Disney+ titled Daredevil: Born Again (2025) in which Woll, Henson, Zurer, Bernthal, and Bethel also reprise their roles.
Premise
edit
The first season sees lawyer-by-day Matt Murdock use his heightened senses from being blinded as a young boy to fight crime at night on the streets of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood as Daredevil while uncovering a conspiracy of the criminal underworld being led by Wilson Fisk.[1] In the second season, Murdock continues to balance life as a lawyer and Daredevil, while crossing paths with Frank Castle / Punisher, a vigilante with far deadlier methods, as well as the return of an ex-girlfriend—Elektra Natchios.[2][3] In the third season, after Fisk is released from prison, Murdock, who has been missing for months following the events of The Defenders, reemerges as a broken man and must decide between hiding from the world as a criminal lawyer or embracing his life as a hero vigilante.[4]

Viewership

As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Karim Zreik, senior vice president of original programming at Marvel Television, provided some viewership demographics for Daredevil in August 2017, noting that the series has attracted a large number of male viewers.[118] Also in the month, Netflix released viewing patterns for the Marvel Netflix series. The data, which came from Netflix's "1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with Jessica Jones, then Daredevil, Luke Cage and finally Iron Fist. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series "in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them." Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching Daredevil would most often then move on to Jessica Jones, and vice versa, while other series "with antiheroes and themes of moral ambiguity" such as Bloodline (2015–2017), Breaking Bad (2008–2013), Dexter (2006–2013) and House of Cards (2013–2018) led viewers to starting Daredevil.[119] In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the "social-media buzz" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in April 2015, the season had nearly 275,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it. For when the second season was released in March 2016, the posts had declined to just over 200,000, and for the third season, looking at data gathered halfway through October 2018, the posts had declined to 75,000.[120]
The series entered Nielsen Media Research's streaming list, which measures the number of minutes watched by United States audiences on television sets, as the eighth-most-watched original series across streaming services for the week of December 20–26, 2021, with 195 million minutes viewed.[121] Daredevil's appearance on the list was believed to be from viewers returning to the series following Cox's appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and D'Onofrio's appearance in Hawkeye (2021).[121][122] Following the release of Echo in January 2024, Daredevil experienced a notable increase in viewership on Disney+.[123][124][125] According to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, Daredevil remained highly in demand in Canada during the week of March 3–9, 2025. The series had a demand average of 35.3 times more than the average TV series in Canada. This performance placed Daredevil at No. 5 on the digital originals chart, following the premiere of its continuation, Daredevil: Born Again, which ranked higher at No. 2 with a demand average of 44.4.[126] Luminate, which gathers viewership data from certain smart TVs in the U.S., reported a 153% increase in hours watched for Daredevil between the week prior to and the week of the premiere of Born Again.[127]

Daredevil (Goddard, 2015–2018) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. The Blind Seer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt Murdock gains superhuman perception after losing his sight.
    - Classic trope; redeemed by psychological realism and moral ambiguity.

  2. Vigilante Lawyer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt balances courtroom justice with masked beatdowns.
    - Duality is core to Daredevil lore, but increasingly familiar post-Arrow.

  3. The Noble Monster (Low Risk)
    - Example: Frank Castle uses horrific violence but adheres to personal ethics.
    - A violent antihero trope with legitimate narrative weight and audience appeal.

  4. Femme Fatale Ex (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Elektra’s return reignites passion and danger.
    - Archetype is conventional, though her arc adds mythic and tragic depth.

  5. The Unkillable Crime Lord (Low Risk)
    - Example: Wilson Fisk survives repeated legal and physical defeat.
    - Common antagonist structure, but D’Onofrio’s performance elevates it.

  6. Sidekick with Limits (Low Risk)
    - Example: Foggy is loyal but morally conflicted, pushing back against Matt.
    - Richer than a “yes man”; used to externalize protagonist’s blind spots.

  7. Innocent Love Interest Turned Investigator (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Karen Page transitions from damsel to investigative crusader.
    - Genre trope; well-executed, though still predictable in trajectory.

  8. The Mentor Who Disappears (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Stick trains Matt, then disappears and reappears unpredictably.
    - A familiar figure; wise, abrasive, and mysterious.

  9. The Tortured Catholic Hero (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt’s guilt and belief frame his morality and violence.
    - Old as Daredevil himself; potent but repetitive by season 3.

 10. The Killer with a Code (Low Risk)
    - Example: Frank targets criminals exclusively, defying true villain status.
    - Common trope, but explored with intense ethical complexity.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

 11. Street-Level Superheroism (Low Risk)
    - Example: The show avoids cosmic spectacle for grounded urban justice.
    - A deliberate subversion of MCU norms; vital to tone and scope.

 12. Origin Story Framed Through Trauma (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Blinded in childhood, Matt’s trauma gives birth to heroism.
    - Standard comic backstory structure, handled with sincerity.

 13. Death Fake-Out (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Elektra is killed and later resurrected with mystical forces.
    - Typical in superhero narratives; adds stakes but weakens permanence.

 14. Evil Is Born, Not Made (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fisk's flashbacks frame him as always latent with violence.
    - Oversimplifies villain psychology, though anchored by performance.

 15. Inner Conflict as External Violence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt’s moral anguish is often mirrored by intense action scenes.
    - Classical noir dynamic; effective, if stylistically familiar.

 16. Hero as Public Enemy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt is pursued by law enforcement, hated by the press.
    - Common in darker superhero arcs; used to good dramatic effect.

 17. Romantic Disillusionment (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Elektra and Matt’s ideals clash fatally.
    - A known tragedy structure; effective due to character grounding.

 18. Secret Identity Breaks Friendship (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Foggy’s discovery of Matt’s alter ego causes deep fracture.
    - Trope is expected but allowed to linger and mature.

 19. Redemption Through Suffering (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt is repeatedly broken and remade through pain.
    - Risk of overuse; becomes thematic excess in season 3.

 20. The Return of the Big Bad (Low Risk)
    - Example: Fisk looms behind the scenes before seizing control again.
    - Formulaic, but executed with pacing and menace.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

 21. Long-Take Fight Scene (Low Risk)
    - Example: Season 1 hallway and Season 3 prison sequences.
    - Became genre-defining; homage turned into signature.

 22. Urban Gothic (Low Risk)
    - Example: Dim alleys, rooftop silhouettes, rain-soaked Hell’s Kitchen.
    - Classic noir palette; not innovative but evocative.

 23. Visual Echoes of Catholic Imagery (Low Risk)
    - Example: Confessionals, crucifixes, acts of penance.
    - Symbolic and recurring; well-integrated thematically.

 24. Color Coding by Moral Alignment (Low Risk)
    - Example: Daredevil’s suit evolves from black to red to scarred again.
    - Useful shorthand; clichéd but grounded in narrative progress.

 25. Visceral Handheld Violence (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fight scenes prioritize exhaustion, blood, and spatial chaos.
    - A genre standard by now, though elevated by choreography and camera work.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

 26. Shadow Organization (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Hand manipulates events from the shadows.
    - Mythic and ancient enemy trope; too murky in execution.

 27. Innocent in Danger (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Karen, Foggy, or random civilians routinely threatened.
    - A genre staple that risks losing tension if overused.

 28. Solo Hero in a Shared Universe (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Daredevil is isolated despite MCU placement.
    - Necessary for tone, but risks feeling artificially restrained.

 29. Criminal With a Heart (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Wilson Fisk’s love for Vanessa humanizes him.
    - Familiar dramatic move; adds dimension, not novelty.

 30. Cliffhanger Resolution Reset (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Endings often walk back developments quickly (e.g. Elektra’s death).
    - Structural risk that can undermine long-form tension.

Marvel Cinematic Universe television series
Daredevil: Born Again is an American television series created by Dario Scardapane and Matt Corman & Chris Ord for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Daredevil. It is the 13th television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, via its Marvel Television label, sharing continuity with the films and television series of the franchise. Born Again is a revival and continuation of Daredevil (2015–2018), an earlier series produced by the previous Marvel Television production company and originally released on Netflix. Scardapane serves as showrunner with Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead as lead directors. The series' name references the 1986 comic book storyline "Born Again" by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli, though it is not a direct adaptation.

Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil from Marvel's Netflix television series and prior Marvel Studios productions, starring alongside Vincent D'Onofrio, Margarita Levieva, Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Wilson Bethel, Nikki M. James, Genneya Walton, Clark Johnson, Michael Gandolfini, and Ayelet Zurer. Zabryna Guevara, Arty Froushan, Kamar de los Reyes, Jon Bernthal, Mohan Kapur, and Tony Dalton also star in the first season.

Following the cancellation of Daredevil in 2018, Cox and D'Onofrio reprised their roles for Marvel Studios projects starting in 2021. A new Daredevil series entered development in early 2022, with Corman and Ord attached as head writers by that May. They gave the series an episodic structure and a lighter tone than the Netflix series. Born Again was announced in July 2022 with a planned 18-episode first season. Marvel Studios decided to overhaul the series by late September 2023 and released Corman and Ord, hiring Scardapane, Benson, and Moorhead the following month to change the series' approach to be more serialized and directly connected to the Netflix series. Initial directors Michael Cuesta, Jeffrey Nachmanoff, and David Boyd received credit for episodes they directed, with Nachmanoff and Boyd returning to film additional material for their episodes. The planned 18-episode season was also split into two seasons. Filming occurs in New York.

Daredevil: Born Again premiered on Disney+ on March 4, 2025, with its first two episodes. The first season consists of nine episodes, and is part of Phase Five of the MCU. It received positive reviews from critics. The second season is set to premiere in March 2026 and will consist of eight episodes. An untitled Punisher television special, starring Bernthal and conceived during the filming of the first season, is in development for the Marvel Studios Special Presentations banner and is also set to premiere in 2026. Both will be part of Phase Six of the MCU.

Premise
Daredevil: Born Again begins several years after the events of Daredevil (2015–2018),[1] and a year after blind lawyer Matt Murdock stopped his activities as the masked vigilante Daredevil.[2] In the first season, Murdock continues his fight for justice as a lawyer while former crime boss Wilson Fisk is elected mayor of New York City, putting the pair on a collision course.[3]

Cast and characters
See also: List of Daredevil (TV series) characters
Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil:
A blind lawyer with superhuman senses from Hell's Kitchen, New York, who leads a double life as a masked vigilante.[4] Cox appreciated being able to first reprise his role from Marvel's Netflix television series in the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and the Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), since he was able to have "a bit of fun" and see Murdock interact with characters that the original Daredevil (2015–2018) series was unable to feature. They could then "set our own tone" with Born Again and "explore and develop all of the possibilities of his life back in New York".[5] Cox began training for the role by October 2022, focusing on mixed martial arts (MMA) in the hope of portraying Murdock as someone who has training in various fight styles that he can employ depending on who he is fighting, rather than just being an all-around brawler.[6]
Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin:
A powerful businessman and crime lord,[4] who is running for mayor of New York City.[7][8] D'Onofrio said the tone for his character in the Disney+ series Echo (2024) would continue in Born Again, which he believed was how the character was best portrayed.[9] After gaining 40 pounds (18 kg) for the role in Daredevil, D'Onofrio chose to wear a fat suit for Born Again as he had done starting with his appearance in the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021). D'Onofrio thought the fat suit had progressed with modern technology to be lighter and more realistic, and he was happy not to have to gain the weight.[10] D'Onofrio added that other techniques were used to "sell the size", and said the character's size at the end of the first season would be "more specific and more detailed" for reasons related to the second season.[11]: 28 
Margarita Levieva as Heather Glenn:
A therapist and Murdock's love interest.[12][13]: 3  She and Murdock have differing views on vigilantism.[11]: 26  Levieva believed Glenn was the first girlfriend Murdock was "truly committed to".[13]: 5 
Deborah Ann Woll as Karen Page:
A former reporter and Murdock's friend and partner at the Nelson, Murdock & Page law firm.[14] Showrunner Dario Scardapane said Page was "the heart and soul of this mythology" and her interactions with Murdock bring more humanity out of him.[11]: 30 
Elden Henson as Franklin "Foggy" Nelson: Murdock's best friend and law partner.[14] Cox described Nelson as "the heartbeat" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).[15]
Wilson Bethel as Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter / Bullseye:
A psychopathic assassin and former FBI agent who is a highly skilled marksman capable of using almost any object as a lethal projectile. He previously masqueraded as Daredevil for Fisk, before Fisk broke his back.[16][17]
Zabryna Guevara as Sheila Rivera: Fisk's mayoral campaign director[18]
Nikki M. James as Kirsten McDuffie: A former New York assistant district attorney and Murdock's new law partner at the law firm Murdock & McDuffie[15][19]
Genneya Walton as BB Urich: A journalist for The BB Report and the niece of Ben Urich, who was killed by Fisk in Daredevil[20]
Arty Froushan as Buck Cashman: Fisk's right-hand man[18]
Clark Johnson as Cherry:
A retired New York Police Department (NYPD) officer who works as an investigator at Murdock & McDuffie.[19] Johnson modeled Cherry after Roy Scheider's character Buddy "Cloudy" Russo in the film The French Connection (1971).[13]: 5 
Michael Gandolfini as Daniel Blake: Fisk's protégé and member of his mayoral campaign[11]: 30 [18]
Ayelet Zurer as Vanessa Fisk:
Wilson's wife, who took over his criminal empire while he was away, leading to tension between the couple.[21][19] Sandrine Holt was originally cast in the role for the series before Zurer, who portrayed Vanessa in Daredevil, was brought back after the creative overhaul of Born Again.[22][23]
Kamar de los Reyes as Hector Ayala / White Tiger: A vigilante whose enhanced powers come from a mystical amulet[24][25]
Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher: A vigilante who, following the brutal murder of his family, aims to fight the criminal underworld by any means necessary, no matter how lethal the results.[26][27][13]: 5 
Mohan Kapur as Yusuf Khan: A Pakistani-American citizen from Jersey City who works as an assistant bank manager at New York Mutual and is the father of the superhero Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel[28][29]
Tony Dalton as Jack Duquesne / Swordsman: A wealthy socialite who is a sword-wielding vigilante[30][31]

Background

Charlie Cox speaking at the 2024 Rose City Comic Con in Portland, Oregon.
Vincent D'Onofrio at GalaxyCon Richmond in 2023
Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio first reprised their roles from Netflix's Daredevil series in Marvel Studios projects in 2021, before they were set to star in Daredevil: Born Again in July 2022
The television series Daredevil, based on the Marvel Comics character Daredevil and produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, premiered on Netflix in April 2015,[35] and lasted for three seasons until its cancellation in November 2018. Netflix said the three seasons would remain on the service, while the title character would "live on in future projects for Marvel". Deadline Hollywood noted that, unlike some of the other Marvel series on Netflix that were also canceled, "the door seems to be wide open" for the series to continue elsewhere, potentially on Disney's streaming service Disney+.[36] However, The Hollywood Reporter said this was unlikely,[37] especially since, as reported by Variety, the original deal between Marvel and Netflix stipulated that the characters could not appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of Daredevil.[38] Kevin A. Mayer, chairman of Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International, said there was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series but this had not yet been discussed.[39] Hulu's senior vice president of originals, Craig Erwich, said his streaming service was also open to reviving the series.[40]

Star Charlie Cox was saddened by the cancellation, explaining that he was excited by the plans for a fourth season, which he and the rest of the cast and crew had expected to be made. He was hopeful there would be an opportunity to portray Matt Murdock / Daredevil again in some form.[41] Amy Rutberg, who portrayed Marci Stahl in the series, said the cast and crew had expected it to last for five seasons, with a new antagonist being introduced in the fourth season before a final showdown between Daredevil and Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk / Kingpin in the fifth.[42] When Marvel Studios began discussions about continuing the Daredevil franchise within their shared universe, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), studio president Kevin Feige insisted they bring back Cox and D'Onofrio, feeling the pair were as "inextricably linked" to their characters as MCU actors Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were to Tony Stark / Iron Man and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively.[2] Feige contacted Cox in June 2020 about reprising his role as Murdock in the MCU,[43] and he announced that Cox was returning for future Marvel Studios projects in December 2021.[5][44] Cox first reprised his role in the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), while D'Onofrio first reprised his role as Fisk in the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021).[45] Daredevil was moved from Netflix to Disney+ in March 2022 after Netflix's license for the series ended and Disney regained the rights.[46][47][48]

Development
Initial work
Marvel Studios decided to make a new Daredevil-led series in January 2022,[11]: 24  following Cox and D'Onofrio's appearances in No Way Home and Hawkeye respectively.[2] Cox discussed such a series in March, believing it should begin a few years after the end of the previous series and be "re-imagined".[49] Regarding whether it should be rated TV-MA as the Netflix series was, he believed Marvel Studios would be able to create a faithful version of the character without that rating. However, he found the comics "more exciting, readable, relatable when it lives in a darker space" such as Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev's run on the comics, and he felt important attributes of the character such as his age, Christian guilt, and history with women were more mature subjects.[50] Cox was hopeful that a new series could have a more faithful adaptation of the 1986 comic book storyline "Born Again" by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli, than the original series which had taken inspiration from that storyline for its third season.[4][49][50] He described the storyline as "kind of a PG comic" and a guide for how the series could work with that rating.[50]

Later in March, a Daredevil reboot series was reported to be in development with Marvel Studios' Feige and Chris Gary as producers.[51][52][53] The series was confirmed to be in development for Disney+ in late May, with Matt Corman and Chris Ord attached as head writers and executive producers.[54][55] The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline Hollywood both described it as a fourth season of the original series.[56][57] During the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con in July, the series was officially announced as Daredevil: Born Again and was revealed to have 18 episodes for its first season.[58] Cox said an 18-episode series was a "huge undertaking" and was chosen in part due to the many story possibilities that come with Murdock being a lawyer.[5] Christian Holub at Entertainment Weekly believed the title was a reference to the character "literally being 'born again' into the official MCU" rather than the series being an adaptation of the "Born Again" storyline.[59] Cox described Born Again as a "whole new thing" and not a fourth season of the Netflix series, which he felt was "the way to go. If you are going to do it again, do it differently."[60] D'Onofrio reiterated this, saying they had few plans to connect to the original.[61] He added that they were working on two seasons and there would be "gigantic payoffs" during the second.[62]

Directors were hired for blocks of episodes: Michael Cuesta joined in March 2023 to direct the first two episodes;[22][13]: 17–18  Jeffrey Nachmanoff joined in May to direct the third and fourth episodes;[63][64]: 2:14–2:24  David Boyd directed the fifth and sixth episodes;[13]: 17–18  and Clark Johnson, a director on the Marvel Netflix series Luke Cage (2016–2018), also joined in May to direct another two episodes.[65]

Creative overhaul
By late September 2023, while production was on hold due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, Marvel Studios decided to overhaul the series with a new creative direction.[51] Filming for six episodes was largely completed by then.[66] Marvel Studios had reviewed that footage and decided Born Again "wasn't working".[2][51] Corman and Ord were let go as head writers, as were the directors for the remainder of the series, and the studio began searching for new writers and directors. The Hollywood Reporter reported that Corman and Ord's episodic take was a large divergence from the Netflix series, including that Cox did not appear in costume as Daredevil until the fourth episode.[51] Marvel planned to retain some elements that had been shot, add new serialized elements, and move closer to the tone of the Netflix series.[51][67] Corman and Ord were expected to still be credited as executive producers.[51] Cox and D'Onofrio had not been convinced that the original approach was working,[66] with Cox saying it was confusing how Born Again was not a direct continuation of the Netflix series or a complete reboot. Brad Winderbaum, the head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios, said the studio believed they could "play it loose" with the history of Daredevil but when they reviewed what had been shot so far they realized that they would have to either fully embrace the Netflix series or start over fresh.[2] D'Onofrio said it was Feige in particular who listened to him and Cox when the pair expressed their concerns about the project.[66]

Dario Scardapane, a writer on Netflix's Daredevil spin-off series The Punisher (2017–2019), was hired to serve as showrunner for Born Again in October 2023.[67] This came after Marvel changed its approach to television production to have more traditional showrunners rather than head writers.[51] Filmmaking duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, who previously worked on the Marvel Studios series Moon Knight (2022) and the second season of Loki (2023), were hired to direct the remaining episodes of the first season.[67] Soon after Scardapane joined, the creative team decided that Born Again should harken back to the tone of the Netflix series and continue storylines from it, rather than be a complete reset.[68] Cox said there was a "fine balance to strike" with this approach, but thought the new creative direction had a good reason for "remaking it" while still being familiar to what came before.[61] In November 2023, Benson and Moorhead said they were reviewing the existing footage and looking to prior Daredevil content, including the Netflix series, to inform the foundation of their direction.[69] They said they were fans of Miller's "Born Again" run, and Benson said he was a fan of Daredevil as a child despite not being "a huge comic book guy".[70] The duo said this was their first MCU project where they were able to find their footing early on after being "thrown in the deep end" with Moon Knight and Loki. They were also more comfortable working with the more grounded style of Born Again, which is similar to their independent films, compared to the "mind-bending sci-fi affairs" of those previous MCU projects. Moorhead described Born Again's stakes as "primal and graspable".[71] D'Onofrio said the directors were Marvel's "hottest talent",[68] and he was confident the series would work after they joined. His friend and Moon Knight co-star Ethan Hawke told D'Onofrio about his positive experience working with the pair, and D'Onofrio was also a fan of their work on Loki, particularly how they handled violence.[72]

Three new episodes were written, including a new pilot episode, as well as additional scenes for the previously shot episodes.[66][73] Cox confirmed in May 2024 that nine episodes had been filmed,[74] which Feige said was the first season of Born Again.[75][76] Cuesta, Nachmanoff, and Boyd were re-confirmed to be credited directors for the series in August 2024.[77] Some of their episodes had "some rejiggering, and [new] framing, and bookends" added while others were left "100% intact".[73] Nachmanoff and Boyd returned to film new footage for the existing episodes and assisted with blending the style of the original episodes with Benson and Moorhead's new material.[64]: 4:44–4:54, 14:50–15:03  Cox said the new version of the series was more in line with the Netflix series,[66] while D'Onofrio said he and others who worked on the previous version were pleased with the new iteration.[78]

Also in August 2024, Feige announced that a second season was planned;[75][76] with the creative overhaul, it was decided that the planned 18-episode season would be split into two, nine-episode seasons.[73][2] In February 2025, Scardapane, Benson, and Moorhead were confirmed to be returning for the second season,[79][2] and Scardapane described its production as a "better-oiled machine".[2] He said the second season would just be eight episodes.[32] Executive producers include Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Sana Amanat, alongside Scardapane, Benson, and Moorhead.[3][79] Additional executive producers for the first season include Marvel Studios' Gary as well as Corman and Ord.[3] Scardapane, Corman, and Ord are credited as the series' creators.[80] The series is released under Marvel Studios' "Marvel Television" label.[81]

Winderbaum said the series could continue beyond the second season, and Marvel Studios was open to bringing back more elements from Daredevil and the other Marvel Netflix series such as Elektra Natchios, the Hand, and the other members of the Defenders team.[2]

Writing
The initial take on the series was described as a legal procedural.[51] Cox said it was dark but not as gory as the Netflix series. He wanted to take what worked from Daredevil and broaden it for Born Again to appeal to a younger audience.[82] Feige said the studio was hoping to experiment with more episodic, "self-contained" episodes, unlike some of their Phase Four series that had a larger story split across multiple episodes.[83] According to Cox, early discussions for the series were about "reinvent[ing] the whole thing" and portraying Murdock as a different person from the one seen in the Netflix series.[1] Murdock's friends Foggy Nelson and Karen Page were largely not acknowledged in this version. Amanat said the creative team struggled to incorporate them into the story, but Cox said there were discussions to do some "cool stuff" with them in the future.[2]

Following the creative overhaul, serialized elements were set to be added.[67] Scardapane said several elements in the original version worked well, but he felt there were storylines that needed to be added along with context from the Netflix series.[2] His pilot acts as a bridge between the Netflix series and Born Again,[84] beginning a few years after the end of Daredevil with Murdock, Nelson, and Page running their law firm and having a "pretty good rhythm" together.[1] Winderbaum said Marvel Studios' approach to connecting Born Again with the Netflix series after the creative overhaul was influenced by how Loki and the animated series X-Men '97 (2024–present) honored prior iterations of their characters to establish new storylines.[85] The cast said the events of the Netflix series were part of their characters' histories, and there are some new storylines that build on the original's events, but they did not want to dwell too much on past events or alienate new viewers who did not watch the Netflix series. Cox praised Scardapane's balance between respecting the Netflix series and not relying on that history too much. Co-star Jon Bernthal said any large diversions to the characters from the past were done for a reason, not simply for the sake of trying a different idea.[86] Some of Scardapane's early ideas for the series were turned down due to Marvel Studios' larger plans for the MCU, but he otherwise had "leeway" to tell a specific Daredevil story. The character's appearances in Daredevil, No Way Home, and the Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) are part of his history, but the series does not lean into all of those events. Scardapane said Marvel had "moved Matt through other corners of the MCU, and now he's back in his own story",[12] which has a more serious tone.[2]

Describing some of Born Again's differences from the Netflix series, Scardapane said the new series would have more fun character moments and "a lot less navel-gazing" than the original. He felt that series had been at its worst when featuring "two characters in a room talking about what a hero is" and was more interested in showing the characters doing things. Scardapane described Born Again as a "New York crime story", compared to the noir tone of the original series, taking inspiration from the series The Sopranos (1999–2007), the film King of New York (1990), and other crime media from the 1990s.[87] Winderbaum likened Born Again to the series Game of Thrones (2011–2019) because it features "multiple factions [in New York City] vying for power in really complex ways".[88] Another difference from Daredevil is the pace of episodes, with Scardapane explaining that there was an edict for the Marvel Netflix series to feature longer character scenes between their action sequences. This was not a requirement for Born Again which allowed the creative team to give it a pace and scope that the Netflix series were unable to.[87] D'Onofrio said Born Again would have a similar tone and feel to the Disney+ series Echo (2024),[89] and Scardapane said it would be darker than Daredevil which he felt only had some dark elements.[87] Within the MCU, the first season is set after Echo. The first episode begins in late 2025, before jumping ahead a year to late 2026. The season continues into early 2027,[90][91] and shows New Year's Eve and Saint Patrick's Day celebrations.[91][19]

Despite using the Born Again subtitle, the series does not directly adapt that storyline or others from the comics.[92] It also does not incorporate any of the planned material for the fourth season of Daredevil.[11]: 24  At the beginning of Born Again, Murdock has not been Daredevil for a year after a "line was crossed",[2] when Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter / Bullseye kills Nelson and Murdock tries to kill Dex in return. Amanat believed killing Nelson, who is Murdock's moral compass, was "the only thing that made sense" when telling a story about Murdock starting a new life without being Daredevil.[93] Cox felt Nelson's death was an appropriate way to start the series, believing the new story needed to be "big, brave, and bold" and "shake things up" from the original.[15] The series sees Fisk being elected mayor of New York City,[20][15] after learning of the need for a strong candidate in the post-credits scene of Echo.[7][8][94] Scardapane said the series was a "two-hander", exploring both Murdock and Fisk.[13]: 4  Though Fisk is the "prime villain", the series features other antagonists who Scardapane said would be "piling up" as the story continues. These include the serial killer Muse, whose storyline continues into the second season.[2]

Casting
Starring in the first season are Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin,[4] Margarita Levieva as Heather Glenn,[12] Deborah Ann Woll as Karen Page, Elden Henson as Foggy Nelson,[14] Wilson Bethel as Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter / Bullseye,[16][17] Zabryna Guevara as Sheila Rivera,[13]: 12  Nikki M. James as Kirsten McDuffie,[13]: 5  Genneya Walton as BB Urich, Arty Froushan as Buck Cashman,[13]: 12  Clark Johnson as Cherry,[13]: 5  Michael Gandolfini as Daniel Blake,[18] Ayelet Zurer as Vanessa Fisk,[23] Kamar de los Reyes as Hector Ayala / White Tiger,[25] Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher,[26][27] Mohan Kapur as Yusuf Khan,[28] and Tony Dalton as Jack Duquesne / Swordsman.[30] Before the creative overhaul, cast members from the Netflix series beyond Cox, D'Onofrio, and Bernthal were not expected to reprise their roles,[95] and Sandrine Holt was cast to replace Zurer as Vanessa. Zurer was brought back after the overhaul,[22][23] along with Woll, Henson, and Bethel.[14][16]

Returning for the second season are Cox,[96] D'Onofrio,[97] Levieva,[98] Woll, Henson,[93] Bethel,[99] James, Walton, Johnson, Gandolfini,[98] and Zurer.[100]

Design
Emily Gunshor was the costume designer for the series, and Michael Shaw was the production designer.[13]: 2  Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding once again designed the Daredevil suit for Born Again, after doing so for the Netflix series.[101] The suit in Born Again has a darker tone of red to reflect Murdock's evolution, along with black detailing and added texture, which was described as less "shiny" than the suit in the Netflix series.[101][13]: 8

Filming for the first season occurred at Silvercup Studios East in Queens,[102] with location work throughout New York.[103] Hillary Fyfe Spera and Pedro Gómez Millán served as cinematographers.[104] Production on the first season was halted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[105]

Visual effects
Gong Myung Lee is the series' visual effects supervisor, with visual effects for the first season provided by Rise FX, FOLKS, Phosphene, Powerhouse VFX, Ghost VFX, Soho VFX, Cantina Creative, Anibrain, Base FX, SDFX, and The Third Floor, Inc.[106]

Music
In July 2024, the Newton Brothers were revealed to be composing music for the series. They previously composed the score for X-Men '97.[107] The pair expressed their love for the Daredevil comics and for the main theme from the original Daredevil series,[108] which was briefly re-used for Daredevil's appearances in She-Hulk and the Disney+ animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (2025–present).[108][109] The Newton Brothers' main theme for Born Again incorporates the Daredevil theme, originally composed by John Paesano and Braden Kimball. It was released as a digital single by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on March 4, 2025.[110] The score for season one was released digitally by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music in two volumes: music from the first four episodes was released on March 28, 2025,[111] with a second volume for the final five episodes released on April 18.[112]

Release
Daredevil: Born Again premiered on Disney+ on March 4, 2025, with its first two episodes.[113][114] The first season consists of nine episodes.[76] The season is part of Phase Five of the MCU,[58] and is being released under Marvel Studios' "Marvel Television" label.[81]

The second season is set to premiere in March 2026,[33] and will consist of eight episodes.[32] It will be part of Phase Six of the MCU.[115] Winderbaum hoped that future seasons could be released annually.[116]

Reception
Viewership
The two-episode premiere received 7.5 million views on Disney+ in its first five days, according to Disney; the company defines a view as total stream time divided by runtime. This was the biggest debut on Disney+ for 2025 at that point, and was compared to the two-episode debut of fellow MCU Disney+ series Agatha All Along (2024), which had 9.3 million views within its first seven days of streaming.[117]

Critical response
For the first season, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 87% approval score with an average rating of 7.75/10, based on 211 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, "Resurrecting Charlie Cox's Daredevil with his virtues intact—namely Vincent D'Onofrio as his terrifying adversary—Born Again is an ambitious and at times ungainly crime saga that marks a mature tonal shift for the MCU."[118] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 69 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[119] Critics overall found the season to have exceeded expectations and highlighted the character-driven storytelling and performances, particularly those of Cox and D'Onofrio. Some were unsure whether it was better or worse than the original Daredevil series,[120] which received more positive reviews according to Rotten Tomatoes.[121]

Television special
Further information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six § Untitled Punisher special
In February 2025, Bernthal was revealed to be reprising his role as Frank Castle / Punisher in an untitled television special, part of the Marvel Studios Special Presentations banner. Reinaldo Marcus Green was set to direct the special and co-write it with Bernthal. The special was conceived during filming for the first season of Born Again,[122] and will be released on Disney+ in 2026 alongside the second season of the series.[123]

Benson asks his co-director. "I'd say so," Moorhead replies. "Because even with Loki, there's no way not to be thrown in the deep end, because you're building an entire world. This one felt immediately accessible to us, because the stakes are extremely primal and graspable. There are two men, in opposition to each other, that couldn't be more different." While the grounded, gritty setting of Daredevil might feel a long way away from Benson and Moorhead's usual mind-bending sci-fi affairs, for the directors it's the most at home they've felt in the MCU so far. "Our indie films are extremely naturalistic, and tend to exist in a world where if a human falls down, it's going to hurt," Benson explains. "In that way, this show's a much better match for us than any other superhero project we've done." Moorhead agrees.

Daredevil: Born Again (Scardapane, 2025–) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES

  1. Hero's Return from Exile (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt Murdock has stopped being Daredevil for a year before events resume.
    - Common motif for revivals; executed with grounded grief (Foggy’s death) for weight.

  2. The Reignited Rivalry (Low Risk)
    - Example: Wilson Fisk becomes mayor, reigniting his feud with Matt.
    - Feels inevitable but dramatically charged and fresh via new power dynamics.

  3. The Reforming Lover (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Heather Glenn challenges Matt’s vigilante worldview.
    - A trope often used to reflect internal struggle; here made richer via ideological contrast.

  4. The Fallen Idealist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt almost kills Dex in retaliation for Foggy’s death.
    - Loss-of-compass trope; stakes are real, but the setup is conventionally tragic.

  5. Legacy Character Insert (Medium Risk)
    - Example: BB Urich continues her uncle Ben’s journalistic legacy.
    - A trope useful for thematic lineage; effectiveness hinges on BB’s independence.

  6. The Suit Returns (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt dons a new Daredevil suit.
    - Costume as identity rebirth; tropey but visually and symbolically necessary.

  7. The Shadow of the Protégé (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Daniel Blake is Fisk’s loyal up-and-comer.
    - Standard archetype; depends on arc payoff in future seasons.

  8. Broken Brotherhood (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Foggy’s offscreen death sets Matt into emotional retreat.
    - Risky trope as motivation; softened by its emotional handling and narrative integration.

  9. The Ghost Wife (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Vanessa and Fisk's marriage is strained after her control of his empire.
    - Common in crime sagas; her agency softens this, but still familiar territory.

 10. The Returning Monster (Low Risk)
    - Example: Bullseye returns, injured but lethal.
    - Classic supervillain trope; solid continuity, well-framed as a personal nemesis.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

 11. Political Corruption as Villainy (Low Risk)
    - Example: Fisk becomes mayor and weaponizes policy.
    - A time-honored crime drama move, with added MCU political weight.

 12. The City on the Brink (Low Risk)
    - Example: Multiple factions vie for control of New York.
    - Evokes Game of Thrones comparisons; well-executed urban power chessboard.

 13. Moral Line Crossed (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt almost kills Dex, triggering a personal reckoning.
    - Trope is central to many vigilante arcs; handled with character specificity.

 14. The Legacy of Violence (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dex’s survival and continued threat mirror Matt’s failures.
    - Familiar trope; earns pathos by being framed through guilt, not glory.

 15. The Vigilante Replaced (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fisk fills the public void left by Daredevil.
    - Inversion of hero-villain roles is thematically effective but structurally conventional.

 16. Revenge as Revival (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt returns to crimefighting not from justice, but grief.
    - Common in rebooted arcs; elevated here by psychological realism.

 17. Resurrection without Reboot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Story builds off Netflix continuity but invites new viewers.
    - Skillful handling of a trope often mismanaged in legacy revivals.

 18. Law vs Justice Dichotomy (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt’s internal struggle between legal and vigilante identities persists.
    - Franchise staple; remains narratively potent and well-handled.

 19. Hero as Target of the System (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fisk uses institutional power to target Murdock and allies.
    - Institutional villainy is classic; fresh in its political execution.

 20. Rise of the New Threat (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Serial killer Muse teased for Season 2.
    - Typical end-of-season setup; interest depends on villain’s distinctiveness.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES

 21. Gritty Realism via Urban Texture (Low Risk)
    - Example: Filming in NYC with subdued lighting and grainy palettes.
    - Expected style; well-matched to Daredevil’s tone and Scardapane’s crime focus.

 22. Evolving Costume Symbolism (Low Risk)
    - Example: Darker red and black textures in the new Daredevil suit.
    - Visual echo of character’s regression and rebirth; elegant trope use.

 23. One-Shot Action Scenes Return (Low Risk)
    - Example: Season premiere includes another long-take fight sequence.
    - Now a Daredevil signature; still delivers in context.

 24. Fragmented Time (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Timeline jumps from late 2025 to early 2027 across season.
    - Structural risk in clarity, but used to convey character evolution over time.

 25. Flashbacks of Emotional Trauma (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Foggy’s death and aftermath revealed in fragmented glimpses.
    - Conventional, but redeemed by restraint and emotional accuracy.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

 26. Shadow Campaign (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fisk runs a secretive, fear-based mayoral bid.
    - Familiar political thriller device; executed with genre fluency.

 27. Hero’s Moral Foil (Low Risk)
    - Example: Punisher returns, spotlighting the line Matt won’t cross.
    - Archetype well-placed in Born Again’s ethical gradient.

 28. Law Firm as Family (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nelson, Murdock & Page depicted as moral community.
    - Standard trope; humanized through character chemistry and consequences.

 29. Villain’s Inner Circle Tension (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Vanessa’s leadership of Fisk’s empire causes friction.
    - Crime genre staple; refreshed by power reversal dynamics.

 30. Reintroduction of Obscure Allies (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Characters like White Tiger and Swordsman appear in supporting roles.
    - MCU connective tissue; depends on performance and plot integration.

Chernobyl is a 2019 historical drama television miniseries that revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 and the cleanup efforts that followed. The series was created and written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. It features an ensemble cast led by Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård, Emily Watson, and Paul Ritter. The series was produced by HBO in the United States and Sky UK in the United Kingdom.

The five-part series premiered simultaneously[a] in the United States on May 6, 2019, and in the United Kingdom on May 7. It received widespread critical acclaim for its performances, historical accuracy, atmosphere, tone, screenplay, cinematography, and musical score. At the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, it received nineteen nominations and won for Outstanding Limited Series, Outstanding Directing, and Outstanding Writing, while Harris, Skarsgård, and Watson received acting nominations. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the series won for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Skarsgård won for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film.[2][3]

The release of each episode was accompanied by a podcast in which Mazin and NPR host Peter Sagal discuss instances of artistic license and the reasoning behind them.[4] While critics, experts and witnesses have noted historical and factual discrepancies in the series, the creators' attention to detail has been widely praised.[5][6]

Premise
Chernobyl dramatizes the story of the April 1986 nuclear plant disaster which occurred in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union, telling the stories of the people who were involved in the disaster and those who responded to it.[7] The series depicts some of the lesser-known stories of the disaster, including the efforts of the firefighters who were the first responders on the scene, volunteers, and teams of miners who dug a critical tunnel under Reactor 4.

The miniseries is based in large part on the recollections of Pripyat locals, as told by Belarusian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich in her book Voices from Chernobyl.[8] Researchers have documented Alexievich's insertion of her own words into the testimonies of her interview subjects in this and others of her books, as well as her extensive revision—even from one edition to the next—of her interviews, which suggests that her works should not be taken as straightforward history.[9][10]

1	"1:23:45"	Johan Renck	Craig Mazin	May 6, 2019	0.756[16]	0.861[17]
Exactly two years after the Chernobyl Nuclear disaster, Soviet chemist Valery Legasov secretly records a series of memoirs, then hangs himself in his Moscow apartment. At 1:23:45 am on April 26, 1986, Reactor No. 4 explodes at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat, Ukrainian SSR.[14][15] Inside the control room, Deputy Chief Engineer Anatoly Dyatlov denies initial reports that the core is exposed, believing this to be impossible. He orders Aleksandr Akimov and Leonid Toptunov to control the core by manually adding water and Emergency Services, including Vasily Ignatenko, to extinguish the fire. All are unknowingly exposed to lethal radiation doses, as are Pripyat civilians who gather to watch the fire from a nearby bridge. Dyatlov meets with Plant Manager Viktor Bryukhanov and Chief Engineer Nikolai Fomin, who decide to lock down the city and cut phones lines to prevent panic and misinformation. Dyatlov witnesses dozens of first responders already suffering from ARS. Legasov is summoned to the Kremlin to advise USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev on the disaster response.
2	"Please Remain Calm"	Johan Renck	Craig Mazin	May 13, 2019	1.004[18]	0.891[17]
Seven hours after the explosion, nuclear physicist Ulana Khomyuk detects a radiation spike in Minsk, Byelorussian SSR, and infers that it is from Chernobyl. At Pripyat Hospital 6, Lyudmilla Ignatenko learns that her husband Vasily is being transported to Moscow with other severe ARS patients. At the Kremlin, Deputy Chairman Boris Shcherbina meets with Gorbachev and the Soviet Central Committee and echoes Dyatlov's false report. Legasov deduces that the core is exposed and persuades Gorbachev to send him and Shcherbina to investigate. Bryukhanov and Fomin blame Legasov for spreading dangerous misinformation, but Shcherbina terminates them after Vladimir Pikalov provides an accurate dosimeter reading that proves Legasov correct. After lying about the region's safety to innocent civilians, Legasov convinces Shcherbina to evacuate Pripyat by revealing that he has already been exposed to a fatal radiation dose. Legasov and Shcherbina smother the core fire with sand and boron, unaware that the underlying water reservoirs are full. Speaking in code with another nuclear physicist, Khomyuk learns of these efforts and informs Legasov that the superheated sand will volatilize the water tanks, triggering a catastrophic steam explosion. Gorbachev authorizes three plant workers to drain the reservoirs, but the radiation disrupts their flashlights, leaving them in darkness.
3	"Open Wide, O Earth"	Johan Renck	Craig Mazin	May 20, 2019	1.063[19]	1.100[17]
The three workers use hand-pumped flashlights and drain the basement reservoirs. Additionally, Gorbachev authorizes a large team of miners from Tula, Russian SFSR to excavate an area beneath the core and install a heat exchanger, preventing a nuclear meltdown and contamination of the surrounding watershed. Shcherbina takes a private walk with Legasov to inform him of overt KGB surveillance. Legasov instructs Khomyuk to interview Dyatlov, Akimov and Toptunov and investigate the cause of the explosion. Lyudmilla arrives in Moscow, where Vasily seems to be recovering. Legasov explains that this is a "latency period", after which the body systems will melt from within. Accordingly, Vasily, Akimov and Toptunov die within weeks, but only after the latter two willingly share their accounts with Khomyuk. She learns that the emergency shutdown procedure (button AZ-5) triggered the explosion, which was deemed impossible. Khomyuk witnesses Lyudmilla with her irradiated husband and threatens the nurse for allowing it. Consequently, Khomyuk is arrested by the KGB and released only on Legasov's insistence. Lyudmilla watches as the bodies of Vasily and several others are entombed within zinc caskets, lowered into a mass grave, and buried in concrete.
4	"The Happiness of All Mankind"	Johan Renck	Craig Mazin	May 27, 2019	1.193[20]	1.311[17]
At Legasov's demand, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is expanded, and hundreds of liquidators are conscripted to decontaminate the forests, topsoil, and wildlife. This includes a team dispatched to kill all remaining pets. Meanwhile, Legasov and Shcherbina attempt to clear Nuclear graphite and other debris from the Chernobyl rooftop using a German robot. However, it is fried instantly by the radiation, which was falsely reported by the Soviet Central Committee to avoid humiliation. Shcherbina and General Nikolai Tarakanov are forced to enlist 3,828 liquidators in 90-second missions to clear the debris by hand. Even with protection, many liquidators later developed cancers or had children with birth defects due to radiation exposure. Despite Soviet State redactions and secrecy, Khomyuk learns that AZ-5 causes a brief spike in nuclear reactivity. Legasov knew this fact from a colleague who discovered that the control rods in RBMK reactor cores are tipped with graphite, who then warned the Kremlin 10 years before Chernobyl, but was rebuked. Khomyuk urges Legasov to broadcast this design flaw to the International Atomic Energy Agency at a conference in Vienna. Shcherbina warns Legasov of the personal dangers of exposing State secrets, proposing a deal with the KGB to quietly fix the reactors. Lyudmilla gives birth, but her baby dies within four hours due to radiation exposure from Vasily.
5	"Vichnaya Pamyat"[d]	Johan Renck	Craig Mazin	June 3, 2019	1.089[21]	2.112[17]
Twelve hours before the explosion, Bryukhanov, Fomin, and Dyatlov learn that a planned safety test must be scrapped, but hoping to win promotions, decide to simply delay it. The KGB awards Legasov for omitting the AZ-5 design flaw from his testimony at the Vienna conference. They also insist that design reforms must wait until after the trial of Dyatlov, Fomin and Bryukhanov, whom the Soviet State is hoping to blame for the disaster. Legasov and Khomyuk do not trust the State to follow through. At the trial, Legasov explains how Bryukhanov, Fomin and Dyatlov's mismanagement of the safety test pushed the reactor to the brink of meltdown. He then details the fatal design flaw of the AZ-5 emergency shutdown button, admitting that his Vienna testimony was a lie and that Dyatlov, Akimov and Toptunov rightly believed the button to be infallible because the Soviet State concealed the flaw. As punishment, the KGB strips Legasov of his titles, awards, and social community. Legasov's suicide causes his memoirs to be widely circulated and forces the USSR to admit the truth and retrofit all nuclear reactors.
Production

Craig Mazin was the writer, creator, and producer of Chernobyl.
Development and writing
In 2014, writer Craig Mazin began researching for the project by reading books and government reports from inside and outside the Soviet Union. Mazin also interviewed nuclear scientists to learn how a reactor works, and former Soviet citizens to gain a better idea of the culture in 1986. Mazin also read several first-person accounts to bring additional authenticity to the story. He explained, "When you're reading the personal stories of people who were there—people who lived near the plant, people who worked at the plant, people who were sent to Chernobyl as part of the effort to clean it up—in those individual accounts, that's really where the story came alive".[22]

Mazin's interest in creating the series originated when he decided to write something that addressed "how we're struggling with the global war on the truth right now".[23] Another inspiration is that he knew Chernobyl exploded, but he did not know why. He explained, "I didn't know why, and I thought there was this inexplicable gap in my knowledge ... So, I began reading about it, just out of this very dry, intellectual curiosity, and what I discovered was that, while the story of the explosion is fascinating, and we make it really clear exactly why and how it happened, what really grabbed me and held me were the incredible stories of the human beings who lived through it, and who suffered and sacrificed to save the people that they loved, to save their countrymen and to save a continent, and continued to do so, against odds that were startling and kept getting worse. I was so moved by it. It was like I had discovered a war that people just hadn't really depicted, and I became obsessed".[24] Mazin said that "The lesson of Chernobyl isn't that modern nuclear power is dangerous. The lesson is that lying, arrogance, and suppression of criticism are dangerous".[25]

In preparation for the miniseries, Mazin visited the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.[26] Mazin made the decision in the early stages not to use Russian or Ukrainian accents, and instead, have the actors use their natural accents. Mazin explained, "We had an initial thought that we didn't want to do the 'Boris and Natasha' clichéd accent because the Russian accent can turn comic very easily. At first, we thought that maybe we would have people do these sort of vaguely Eastern European accents—not really strong but noticeable. What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents. They will not act, they will act accents and we were losing everything about these people that we loved. Honestly, I think after maybe one or two auditions we said 'OK, new rule. We're not doing that anymore'".[27] Mazin also did not cast any American actors, as that could potentially pull the audience out of the story.[28]

In early 2017, Carolyn Strauss joined the project as producer, and pitched the show with Mazin to HBO's Kary Antholis. According to Antholis: "It was the best pitch I've heard in 25 years of listening to pitches — there's nothing that really comes close to it".[29] Regardless, viewership expectations remained low during development, and the series was eventually assigned a Monday night time slot. Antholis convinced Sky UK to co-produce, lessening HBO's financial burden to around $15 million of the show's $40 million budget.[29]

On July 26, 2017, it was announced that HBO and Sky had given a series order to Chernobyl. It was HBO's first co-production with Sky UK. The five-episode miniseries was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. Mazin also served as an executive producer alongside Carolyn Strauss and Jane Featherstone, with Chris Fry and Renck acting as co-executive producers.[7][30] On March 11, 2019, it was announced that the miniseries would premiere on May 6, 2019.[31] On June 4, 2019, Craig Mazin made the original scripts of all episodes available for downloading as PDFs (see External links below).[32]

A companion podcast for the miniseries had new episodes published as each TV episode aired on HBO.[33] The podcast featured conversations between Mazin and host Peter Sagal including discussions of where the show was as true as possible to historical events and where events were consolidated or modified as part of artistic license.[4]

Casting
Simultaneously with the initial series announcement, it was confirmed that Jared Harris would star in the series.[30] On March 19, 2018, it was announced that Stellan Skarsgård and Emily Watson had joined the main cast, marking their second collaboration after Breaking the Waves.[34] In May 2018, it was announced that Paul Ritter, Jessie Buckley, Adrian Rawlins, and Con O'Neill also had joined the cast.[35]

Filming

The Soviet-era district of Fabijoniškės in Vilnius, Lithuania was used to portray Pripyat
In April 2018, principal photography began in Lithuania.[30] Initial filming started on May 13, 2018, in Fabijoniškės, a residential district in Vilnius, Lithuania, which was used to portray the Ukrainian city of Pripyat, since the district maintained an authentic Soviet atmosphere. An area of densely built panel housing apartments served as a location for the evacuation scenes. Director Johan Renck heavily criticised the amount of diverse and eye-catching modern windows in the houses, but was not concerned about removing them in post-production.[36]

At the end of March, production moved to Visaginas, Lithuania, to shoot both the exterior and interior of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, a decommissioned nuclear power station that is sometimes referred to as "Chernobyl's sister" due to its visual resemblance and the nuclear reactor design used at both Chernobyl and Ignalina, both being RBMK nuclear power reactors. In early June 2018, production moved to Ukraine to shoot minor final scenes.[36] The filming of Chernobyl took 16 weeks.[37] The series has a reported production budget of $40 million, as part of a $250 million deal between HBO and Sky.[38] According to series cinematographer Jakob Ihre, various Soviet-era films–namely Andrei Rublev, Stalker and Come and See–inspired the look of the miniseries.[39]

Music
Main article: Chernobyl: Music from the Original TV Series
The musical score was composed by Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir. In August 2018, she began recording the score with Chris Watson at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, where the series was being preliminarily shot.[40] She used the recordings from the power plant, deciding not to depend on instruments and pre-recorded material to create the score, as she wanted to experience from a listener's perspective on what it is like to actually be inside of a power plant.[41] The original score album was released by the record labels Deutsche Grammophon and WaterTower Music on May 31, 2019,[42][43] with a vinyl edition released by Decca on September 6, 2019.[44]

Historical accuracy
The series was praised in the media for being exhaustively researched,[45] but some commentators noted inaccuracies or liberties were taken for dramatic purposes, such as Legasov being present at the trial.[46][47] The first episode depicts Legasov timing his suicide down to the second (1:23:45) to coincide with the second anniversary of the Chernobyl explosion. Legasov actually died by suicide a day later. The epilogue acknowledges that the character of Ulana Khomyuk is fictional, a composite of Soviet scientists. Journalist Adam Higginbotham, who spent a decade researching the disaster and authored the non-fiction account Midnight in Chernobyl, points out in an interview that there was no need for scientists to "uncover the truth" because "many nuclear scientists knew all along that there were problems with this reactor—the problems that led ultimately to an explosion and disaster".[48] Artistic license was also used in the depiction of the "Bridge of Death", from which spectators in Pripyat watched the aftermath of the explosion. The miniseries asserts that the spectators subsequently died, a claim which is now generally held to be an urban legend.[49][50][51]

The series also discusses a potential third steam explosion, due to the risk of corium melting through to the water reservoirs below the reactor building, as being in the range of 2 to 4 megatons. This would have been physically impossible under the circumstances, as exploding reactors do not function as thermonuclear bombs.[52][53] According to series author Craig Mazin, the claim was based on one made by Belarusian nuclear physicist Vassili Nesterenko about a potential 3–5 Mt third explosion, even though physicists hired for the show were unable to confirm its plausibility.[54]

The series' production design, such as the choice of sets, props, and costumes, has received high praise for its accuracy. Several sources have commended the attention to even minor setting details, such as the use of actual Kyiv-region license plate numbers, and a New Yorker review states that "the material culture of the Soviet Union is reproduced with an accuracy that has never before been seen" from either Western or Russian filmmakers.[55][48][5][56] Oleksiy Breus, a Chernobyl engineer, commends the portrayal of the symptoms of radiation poisoning;[57] Robert Gale, a doctor who treated Chernobyl victims, states that the miniseries overstated the symptoms by suggesting that the patients were radioactive.[58] In a more critical judgment, a review from the Moscow Times highlights some small design errors: for instance, Soviet soldiers are inaccurately shown as holding their weapons in Western style and Legasov's apartment was too "dingy" for a scientist of his status.[59]

In a 1996 interview, Lyudmilla Ignatenko said that her baby "took the whole radioactive shock [...] She was like a lightning rod for it".[60] This perception that her husband, Vasily, was radioactive and caused the death of her daughter soon after birth was recreated in the miniseries. However, Ukrainian medical responder Alla Shapiro, in a 2019 interview with Vanity Fair, said such beliefs were false, and that once Ignatenko was showered and out of his contaminated clothing, he would not have been dangerous to others, precluding this possibility.[61]

During an interview to BBC News Russian in 2019, Lyudmilla Ignatenko described how she suffered harassment and criticism when the series was aired. She claimed reporters hounded her at home in Moscow and even jammed their foot in her door as they tried to interview her, and that she suffered criticism for exposing her unborn daughter to Vasily, despite the fact she hadn't known anything about radiation then and that risk to a fetus from such exposure is infinitesimally small.[58] She said she never gave HBO and Sky Atlantic permission to tell her story, saying there had been a single phone call offering money after filming had been completed. She thought the call was a hoax because it came from a Moscow number and hung up. HBO Sky rejects this, saying they had exchanges with Lyudmilla before, during and after filming with the opportunity to participate and provide feedback and at no time did she express a wish for her story to not be included.[62]

The portrayal of Soviet officials, including the plant management and central government figures, received some criticism. Breus, the Chernobyl engineer, argues that the characters of Viktor Bryukhanov, Nikolai Fomin and Anatoly Dyatlov were "distorted and misrepresented, as if they were villains".[57] Some reviews criticized the series for creating a stark moral dichotomy, in which the scientists are depicted as overly heroic while the government and plant officials are uniformly villainous.[55][63][64][65] The occasional threats of execution from government officials were also seen by some as anachronistic: Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen argues that "summary executions, or even delayed executions on orders of a single apparatchik, were not a feature of Soviet life after the nineteen-thirties".[55][59] Higginbotham takes a more positive view of the portrayal of the authorities, arguing that the unconcerned attitude of the central government was accurately depicted.[48]

Release
The miniseries premiered on May 6, 2019, on HBO. In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, it premiered on May 7, 2019, on Sky Atlantic.

Home media
The miniseries was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 1, 2019.[66] A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray was released on December 1, 2020.[67]

Reception
Critical response
Chernobyl received widespread critical acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 95% based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Chernobyl rivets with a creeping dread that never dissipates, dramatizing a national tragedy with sterling craft and an intelligent dissection of institutional rot."[68] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[69]

Reviewers for The Atlantic, The Washington Post, and the BBC observed parallels to contemporary society by focusing on the power of information and how dishonest leaders can make mistakes beyond their comprehension.[70] Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic hailed the series as a "grim disquisition on the toll of devaluing the truth";[71] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post praised it for showcasing "what happens when lying is standard and authority is abused".[72] Meera Syal praised Chernobyl as a "fiercely intelligent exposition of the human cost of state censorship. Would love to see similar exposé of the Bhopal disaster".[73] David Morrison was "struck by the attention to accuracy" and says the "series does an outstanding job of presenting the technical and human issues of the accident."[74]

Jennifer K. Crosby, writing for The Objective Standard, says that the miniseries "explores the reasons for this monumental catastrophe and illustrates how it was magnified by the evasion and denial of those in charge," adding that "although the true toll of the disaster on millions of lives will never be known, Chernobyl goes a long way toward helping us understand [its] real causes and effects."[75] In a negative article titled "Chernobyl: The Show Russiagate Wrote," Aaron Giovannone of the American left-wing publication Jacobin wrote that "even as we worry about the ongoing ecological crisis caused by capitalism, Chernobyl revels in the failure of the historical alternative to capitalism, which reinforces the status quo, offering us no way out of the crisis."[76]

Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian response
The miniseries was well received by some critics and audiences in Russia.[77][78][79] Vladimir Medinsky, Russian culture minister, whose father was one of the Chernobyl liquidators, called the series "masterfully made" and "filmed with great respect for ordinary people".[80] It was reported that Russian state-run NTV television channel has been producing its own "patriotic" version of the Chernobyl story in which the CIA plays a key role in the disaster.[81][82] The Russians then claimed that the series in question had been in production since before HBO's miniseries and was not created in response to it.[83] An apparent trailer for the series was uploaded to YouTube but was later deleted following negative reaction from the Russian viewers.[84]

In a statement, Sergey Malinkovich, the head of the executive committee of the central committee of the Communists of Russia party, called for a criminal libel lawsuit to be brought under the Criminal Code of Russia against Chernobyl's writer, director and producers, describing the show as "disgusting".[85][86][87] He also demanded that Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) block access to the "filthy" miniseries.[88] Marianna Prysiazhniuk of Vice Media noted that multiple Russian media outlets describe the miniseries as one-sided, incomplete, or anti-Russian propaganda.[89] Argumenty i Fakty dismissed the show as "a caricature and not the truth" and "The only things missing are the bears and accordions!" said Stanislav Natanzon, lead anchor of Russia-24, one of the country's main state-run news channels.[90]

In Ukraine, Anna Korolevska, deputy director at the Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum in Kyiv, said "Today young people coming to power in Ukraine know nothing about that disaster in 1986. It was a necessary film to make and HBO have obviously tried their best; as for us, we are going to create a special tour about Chernobyl's historic truth, inspired by the HBO series."[91] Bermet Talant, a Ukrainian journalist, noted that "In Russia, a state that still takes pride in the Soviet legacy, the series has faced criticism from the official media. Meanwhile, many in Ukraine appreciated the series for humanizing a tragic chapter in the country's history. [...] Ukrainian viewers also appreciated HBO's Chernobyl for praising the heroism and self-sacrifice of ordinary people."[92]

Belarusian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, whose book inspired the series, said "We are now witnessing a new phenomenon that Belarusians, who suffered greatly and thought they knew a lot about the tragedy, have completely changed their perception about Chernobyl and are interpreting this tragedy in a whole new way. The authors accomplished this, even though they are from a completely different world – not from Belarus, not from our region." She also noted its popularity with young Belarusians.[93]

Reception in China
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Chinese netizens drew parallels between the Soviet response to the Chernobyl disaster and the initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak by the Chinese government.[94][95] As a response, the page for Chernobyl on Douban, which by that point had amassed more than 200,000 ratings with an average of 9.6 out of 10, was taken down.[96]

Understood. Here's the cliché audit for Chernobyl (2019), focusing on low- and medium-risk narrative clichés from your master trope list:

pgsql
Copy code
Cliché Audit: CHERNOBYL (2019)

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING CLICHÉS

A. The Lone Truth-Teller
   - Used with Valery Legasov.
   - Medium-risk: mitigated by ensemble support and contextual realism.
   - The show leans into Legasov as a Cassandra figure warning others who refuse to listen.

B. Composite Genius
   - Embodied by Ulana Khomyuk (a fictional amalgam).
   - Medium-risk: Ulana carries the emotional weight of a dozen real scientists, risking oversimplification.

C. Doomed but Noble Hero
   - Several examples: Vasily Ignatenko, Legasov, the volunteer divers.
   - Low-risk: grounded in real history, but still follows the "sacrifice for the greater good" beat.

D. Noble Bureaucrat
   - Shcherbina transforms from dismissive party man to empathetic protector.
   - Medium-risk: character arc relies on familiar beats of the redemption-through-truth narrative.

E. Martyrdom as Moral Lesson
   - Legasov’s suicide and the entombed first responders are framed as sacrifices that expose systemic rot.
   - Medium-risk: risks didacticism but serves thematic function.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING CLICHÉS

A. Based on a True Story (Used for Narrative Authority)
   - Low-risk: expected for genre, but risks dramatization undermining nuance.
   - Offset here by end-episode historical recaps and companion podcast.

B. Institutional Rot as Villain
   - The Soviet system plays antagonist more than any single person.
   - Medium-risk: creates a simplistic binary between “heroes who care” and “villains who lie.”

C. "You Can’t Handle the Truth" Bureaucracy
   - Repeated scenes of truth being silenced, reports buried, and experts ignored.
   - Low-risk: true to theme, but pattern is familiar from many procedural dramas.

D. The Cover-Up is Worse Than the Crime
   - Central narrative engine; risks redundancy across episodes.
   - Medium-risk: repetition may blunt emotional payoff, though justified by real-world stakes.

E. Sacrifice as Narrative Closure
   - Final episode (Legasov’s trial testimony and aftermath) frames the truth as requiring ultimate sacrifice.
   - Low-risk: thematically congruent but a familiar closer.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING CLICHÉS

A. Desaturated Color Palette to Signal “Serious”
   - Constant gray-greens and beige hues.
   - Medium-risk: creates immersion but aligns with prestige-TV visual shorthand.

B. Static Framing as Symbol of Systemic Oppression
   - Shot design often emphasizes rigidity, symmetry, and containment.
   - Low-risk: stylistic choice that reinforces theme but may be overused in similar dramas.

C. Radiation as Invisible Horror
   - The threat is unseen but ever-present.
   - Low-risk: extremely effective, though it follows common visual metaphor patterns from contagion/contamination narratives.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS CLICHÉS

A. Slow-Walking Toward Fate
   - Characters (especially divers and rooftop liquidators) often move slowly toward certain death.
   - Medium-risk: used in countless disaster/historical fictions, though powerfully executed here.

B. Time-Lapsed Deterioration
   - Radiation sickness depicted through progressive physical decline.
   - Low-risk: standard depiction, though noted by some experts as slightly exaggerated for drama.

C. Conspicuous Lack of Villain Complexity
   - Bryukhanov, Dyatlov, and Fomin are presented as largely culpable and unsympathetic.
   - Medium-risk: risks flattening institutional responsibility into individual blame.

D. “The Baby Dies” Emotional Spike
   - Used via Lyudmilla Ignatenko’s newborn.
   - Medium-risk: emotionally manipulative if fictionalized, but partly based on real accounts.

E. Opening with Suicide, Closing with Memoir
   - Bookends the narrative with a familiar “death and document” framing device.
   - Medium-risk: effective, but recognizable from other biographical dramas.

List of episodes
The first season of the American television series The Mandalorian is part of the Star Wars franchise, set after the events of the film Return of the Jedi (1983). It follows a lone bounty hunter who goes on the run to protect "The Child". The season was produced by Lucasfilm, Fairview Entertainment, and Golem Creations, with Jon Favreau serving as showrunner.

Pedro Pascal stars as the title character. Work on a new live-action Star Wars television series was announced in November 2017. Favreau signed on in March 2018, with Pascal cast a month after filming began in October 2018 at Manhattan Beach Studios in California. Visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic developed the StageCraft technology for the series, using virtual sets and a 360-degree video wall to create the series' environments. In addition to this new technology, practical effects were emphasized for the series.

The eight-episode season premiered on the streaming service Disney+ on November 12, 2019, and ran until December 27. It was met with positive reviews, with praise for the visual effects, action sequences, characters, performances (particularly Pascal's), the chemistry between the title character and the Child, cinematography, and Ludwig Göransson's musical score. It was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, and won seven Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. A second season was confirmed in July 2019.[1]

1	1	"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian"	Dave Filoni	Jon Favreau	November 12, 2019
After completing a bounty for Guild leader Greef Karga, a Mandalorian bounty hunter accepts an under-the-table commission on the outpost world of Nevarro from an enigmatic Client with connections to the former Galactic Empire. The Client directs the Mandalorian to find an unnamed fifty-year-old target that the Client's colleague Dr. Pershing insists be brought back alive. The Mandalorian receives a single bar of beskar steel, sacred to his people, as a down payment. He takes the steel to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an armorer uses it to make him a pauldron. The Mandalorian travels to the planet of the target's last reported location, where vapor farmer Kuiil is tired of the constant bounty hunting activity in his area and hopes the Mandalorian can end it. Kuiil directs the Mandalorian to a heavily defended encampment where he reluctantly works with bounty hunting droid IG-11 to clear the camp and find the quarry, a child. IG-11 attempts to kill the infant per its bounty orders. The Mandalorian shoots and destroys the droid, taking the child alive.
2	2	"Chapter 2: The Child"	Rick Famuyiwa	Jon Favreau	November 15, 2019
The Mandalorian returns with the child to find his ship being stripped for parts by Jawas. He attacks them but they escape in their sandcrawler. The next day, Kuiil helps the Mandalorian locate the Jawas and negotiate the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He and the child find the Mudhorn's cave, but the beast attacks him and damages his armor. After a prolonged battle, the Mudhorn is about to kill the Mandalorian when the child uses the Force to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its insides. With his ship's components returned to him, the Mandalorian works with Kuiil to repair the ship. The Mandalorian then leaves the planet with the child.
3	3	"Chapter 3: The Sin"	Deborah Chow	Jon Favreau	November 22, 2019
The Mandalorian delivers the child to the Client on Nevarro and collects the bounty, 20 bars of beskar steel. Uncharacteristically, the Mandalorian asks about the Client's plans for the child and is told that they are not his concern. Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the armorer replaces and upgrades the Mandalorian's damaged armor and weapons using most of the beskar steel. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Karga and prepares to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the child, he returns to the Client's base and kills the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory, where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by Karga and other bounty hunters who demand that he hand over the child. He refuses and a firefight begins. Outnumbered and cornered, the Mandalorian is saved when other Mandalorians arrive from the enclave, attacking the bounty hunters and allowing him to get to his ship and escape with the child.
4	4	"Chapter 4: Sanctuary"	Bryce Dallas Howard	Jon Favreau	November 29, 2019
Arriving on the sparsely populated forest planet Sorgan, the Mandalorian encounters ex-Rebel Alliance shock trooper-turned-mercenary Cara Dune. Dune is in hiding and asks the Mandalorian to leave so as to not draw attention to the planet. He prepares to leave, but is approached by desperate fishermen who offer to hire him. They want him to drive off a band of Klatoonian raiders that have been attacking their village. He accepts the job in exchange for lodging, and uses their credits to enlist Dune's help. They are housed by Omera, a widowed mother, and the Mandalorian confides in her that no one has seen him without his helmet since his tribe took him in as an orphaned child. The Mandalorian and Dune help the villagers drive the raiders away and destroy an old Imperial AT-ST the raiders were using. A few weeks later, with peace restored, the Mandalorian plans to leave the child in the village, but a Guild bounty hunter finds them and is killed by Dune. Realizing the child is not safe in the village, the Mandalorian departs with the child.
5	5	"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger"	Dave Filoni	Dave Filoni	December 6, 2019
The Mandalorian defeats a pursuing bounty hunter in a dogfight. He lands his damaged ship at a repair dock run by mechanic Peli Motto in Mos Eisley on Tatooine. He seeks work in a cantina to pay for the repairs, meeting aspiring bounty hunter Toro Calican, who is tracking elite mercenary and assassin Fennec Shand. Calican needs to catch Shand to join the Guild, and the Mandalorian agrees to help in exchange for the bounty reward. They capture Shand in the desert, but she destroys one of their speeder bikes. While the Mandalorian retrieves a dewback for transportation, Shand tells Calican that the Mandalorian betrayed the Guild by stealing the child, making the bounty on him and the child worth more than hers. Shand offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free, but he shoots her instead and rides the remaining speeder bike to the repair dock, taking Motto and the Child hostage. The Mandalorian arrives, disorients Calican with a flare, and kills him. He uses Calican's money to pay Motto for the repairs and leaves Tatooine.
6	6	"Chapter 6: The Prisoner"	Rick Famuyiwa	Story by : Christopher Yost
Teleplay by : Christopher Yost and Rick Famuyiwa	December 13, 2019
The Mandalorian contacts his former partner Ran Malk for work, and is offered a place in a five-man job. He is joined by ex-Imperial sharpshooter Mayfeld, Devaronian strongman Burg, droid pilot Q9-0, and Twi'lek knife-expert Xi'an for a mission to rescue Xi'an's brother Qin, a prisoner of the New Republic. The team infiltrate the prison ship, fight off security droids, and kill the ship's security chief, though not before he triggers a security beacon. The crew rescue Qin but double-cross the Mandalorian. Q9-0 finds a message from Karga to the Mandalorian discussing the child, and finds the child in the Mandalorian's ship. Meanwhile, the Mandalorian escapes, defeats each crew member, and captures Qin. The Mandalorian leaves Mayfeld, Burg, and Xi'an locked up on the prison transport before delivering Qin to Ran. He departs with his payment while Ran immediately launches a fighter to kill the Mandalorian, but discovers the New Republic beacon on Qin. A trio of New Republic X-wing fighters arrive and attack Ran's station.
7	7	"Chapter 7: The Reckoning"	Deborah Chow	Jon Favreau	December 18, 2019
The Mandalorian receives a message from Karga, whose town on Nevarro has been overrun by the Client's troops. Karga proposes that the Mandalorian use the child as bait in order to kill the Client and free the town. In return, Karga would stop his guild from hunting the Mandalorian and the child. Sensing a trap, the Mandalorian recruits Dune and Kuiil, with Kuiil bringing along a rebuilt and reprogrammed IG-11 to protect the child. They meet Karga and his associates, but are attacked by flying creatures. Karga is injured and the child uses the Force to heal him. In return, Karga murders his associates and confesses his original plan to shoot the Mandalorian and take the child to the Client. Instead, Karga pretends that Dune has captured the Mandalorian while Kuiil returns the child to the ship. During the meeting, troops working for the Client's boss, Moff Gideon, open fire on the building and kill the Client, trapping the Mandalorian, Karga, and Dune inside. Moff Gideon arrives, demanding the child. Outside the town, scout troopers kill Kuiil and take the child.
8	8	"Chapter 8: Redemption"	Taika Waititi	Jon Favreau	December 27, 2019
IG-11 defeats the scout troopers and rescues the child. Gideon informs Karga, Dune, and the Mandalorian that they will be executed if they do not hand over the child. IG-11 arrives to save the others. Gideon's forces attack and the Mandalorian is injured. He instructs the others to escape and find help from the enclave while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to his wounds. Joining the others afterwards, the Mandalorian discovers that the other Mandalorians are gone except for the Armorer. She tasks him with returning the child to its kind before holding off the arriving stormtroopers. The group escapes down an underground lava river on a ferry, but are ambushed by stormtroopers at the end of the tunnel. IG-11 self-destructs to defeat them. Gideon attacks in a TIE fighter but the Mandalorian uses his newly-forged jetpack to bring the craft down. After burying Kuiil, the Mandalorian embarks on his new mission with the child while Karga and Dune stay behind on Nevarro. Gideon survives the crash and frees himself with the Darksaber.[a]

Development
In November 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing a live-action Star Wars television series for the new streaming service Disney+.[15] Jon Favreau pitched an idea for the series to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who suggested he discuss the idea with Dave Filoni, executive producer on the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.[16] In March 2018, Lucasfilm announced that Favreau would write and executive produce the series,[17] with Filoni, Kennedy, and Colin Wilson also executive producing.[18] In May, Favreau said he had written four of the series' eight episodes before being officially hired for the project.[19]

Favreau announced that the series was titled The Mandalorian on October 3, and revealed the premise of the show.[20] Directors for the season were revealed the next day, including Filoni, Taika Waititi, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rick Famuyiwa, and Deborah Chow.[18] Favreau was unable to direct any of the first season due to his commitments to The Lion King (2019),[21] and wanted the series' directors to be a diverse group of filmmakers who could bring different perspectives to the series. The only prerequisite he had for the directors was that they love Star Wars. According to Famuyiwa, Favreau described the group as a "Dirty Dozen, Magnificent Seven type of crew".[22] The season had a budget of $100 million.[23]

Casting
After being rumored to be cast in the title role, Pedro Pascal was confirmed to be portraying the Mandalorian in November 2018.[5] Pascal initially thought he was being cast as the Star Wars character Boba Fett due to the visual similarities between that character and the Mandalorian,[24] but the latter is actually a separate character named Din Djarin.[6] Gina Carano and Nick Nolte joined the series' cast later in November.[25][11] Lucasfilm announced the next month that Pascal would star alongside Carano, Nolte, Giancarlo Esposito, Emily Swallow, Carl Weathers, Omid Abtahi, and Werner Herzog.[26] Favreau revealed in March 2019 that Taika Waititi would provide the voice for a bounty hunter droid in the series, believed to be the character IG-88.[27] This was revealed a month later to be a new character, IG-11, when character details for other cast members were announced.[8] Weathers' character, Greef Karga, was originally an alien that was killed off in the third episode; the prosthetic make-up was removed and the role extended during production.[28]

The footage shown at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019 revealed that Bill Burr and Mark Boone Junior had been cast in the season, with Burr portraying an outlaw.[29] At the D23 Expo in August, it was revealed Ming-Na Wen would appear,[30] and the next month, Julia Jones's casting was announced.[31]

Filming and effects
New technology
Further information: The Mandalorian § New technology
Visual effects studio Industrial Light & Magic, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, partnered with video game developer Epic Games to create a new system for the series named StageCraft, based on Epic's game engine Unreal Engine. StageCraft consists of large LED video screens on which digital environments can be rendered in real time for actors to perform in front of.[32][7] During pre-production on the series, virtual photography was used to plan the series' filming and determine what environments would be needed on set. The digital environments were then created by ILM and added to StageCraft ready for live action photography with the actors. Some of these environments were based on location photography in countries such as Iceland and Chile.[7] During filming, the digital environments were rendered on a video wall in real time, allowing the filmmakers and actors to see the environments.[32] The images rendered on the video wall were often of a high enough quality to be used as final effects.[32]

Principal photography
Filming began during the first week of October 2018, with Filoni directing the first episode.[18] The season was filmed at Manhattan Beach Studios in California under the working title Project Huckleberry,[7][33] with limited location filming in the Los Angeles area.[7] This first and third episodes were filmed together as one block, with Filoni and Chow working on their episodes at the same time.[34] George Lucas visited the series' set as a birthday surprise for Favreau on October 19.[35] Several items described as "nothing of substance" were stolen from the series' set on October 25.[36]

Filoni made his live-action directorial debut with the series.[21] He saw The Mandalorian as a chance to apply lessons he had learned from Lucas about live-action filmmaking during the making of the Star Wars animated series, and also described Favreau as a mentor who was furthering Filoni's education and could help him overcome challenges specific to live-action.[37] Filoni also served as a second unit director for the other filmmakers, filming quick pick-up shots for them as needed while they were busy on other scenes.[38] Favreau noted that the fourth episode of the series, "Sanctuary", was the most difficult to make due to its forest setting and action requirements, and joked that this was the reason that Howard, the most inexperienced of the first season's directors, was given that episode to direct.[22] Howard felt protected by the experience of Favreau and Filoni, feeling comfortable to go to them with any questions about filmmaking and Star Wars, respectively.[39] Howard also felt she had creative freedom when directing the episode, something that surprised her father Ron Howard who directed the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).[40]

Pascal's commitments to filming Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) and performing in a Broadway production of King Lear resulted in stunt doubles Brendan Wayne and Lateef Crowder portraying the Mandalorian on set in Pascal's absence, with Pascal later dubbing the lines.[41][42] Pascal said he felt uneasy about this when there were "more than just a couple of pages of a one-on-one scene [and not] being able to totally author" the performance. But he said it was "so easy in such a sort of practical and unexciting way for it to be up to" Wayne and Crowder.[42] Wayne worked with Pascal to develop the movements of the character.[41] Filming for the first season wrapped on February 27, 2019.[43]

Practical effects
Favreau and the series' directors put emphasis on using practical effects where possible, with Famuyiwa explaining that it was the combination of groundbreaking effects and a grounded world and characters that first drew him to Star Wars as a child.[44] Favreau noted that the StageCraft technology used during filming allowed the filmmakers to use more traditional production techniques since they were working within an environment that they could see on set.[38] Legacy Effects created practical armor for the series,[45] as well as the animatronics for the alien creatures. Visual effects were used to remove puppeteers and control rods from scenes that used puppets.[46] One of the modelmakers creating models and puppets for the series was Tony McVey, who worked on the original Star Wars films. In order to recreate techniques used on the original Star Wars films, The Mandalorian's prop master, Josh Roth, designed new weapons for the series based on real guns, as the original props had been modified versions of World War II gun props.[44]

"The Child" was created primarily with an animatronic puppet, which was augmented with visual effects.[7] The production had originally expected to mostly use CGI for the character.[46] Different puppeteers controlled its body and head movements, its eyes, and its ears. Other puppeteers moved it for walking scenes.[44] During filming on the third episode, Chow and the visual effects team removed the puppet so they could film a version of a scene without it. This was in case they decided that the puppet was not convincing enough and would need to be replaced with CGI. Herzog called them cowards for not trusting the puppet, and encouraged them not to avoid visual effects.[9][44] He proved to be right, as the production discovered that the puppet worked better than expected and began retooling scenes to work around its limitations rather than resort to CGI.[46][44]

Favreau wanted the series to feature "D-list" characters from the Star Wars films, which led to him creating the Ugnaught character Kuill. The species was first introduced in the background of The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Legacy's effects supervisor John Rosengrant explained that a performer could not emote through the heavy prosthetics required to portray an Ugnaught, so animatronics were added to the prosthetic head. Actress Misty Rosas wore the head and costume for the character while one puppeteer controlled the mouth movements and another controlled the eyebrows. The character's lines were recorded ahead of filming, with actor Nick Nolte providing two or three different readings for each line that could be played for the other actors. While performing, Rosas had to use physical signals to indicate to the puppeteers when she wanted the character speak.[44]

The series includes Blurrgs, alien creatures that were first introduced in the non-canon film Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985). Filoni introduced them into canon with The Clone Wars and Rebels.[47] They were primarily created with CGI,[46] but the first time they are seen in the series, through the Mandalorian's binoculars, physical models were used. These were created by McVey and stop motion animated by Stoopid Buddy Stoodios. The stop motion movement informed the animation of the CGI Blurrgs.[44] Legacy created a practical model of the droid assassin IG-11 as an on-set stand-in for lighting reference. It included the head, torso, and arms of the character, and basic puppeteering could be used to move the head. During filming, the awkward movement of the model was deemed to be a good fit for the character and it was used in more scenes than expected. The CGI version was moved in ways that would not be physically possible for a human performer, taking advantage of the character's inhuman appearance. This differed from K-2SO, a droid that animation director Hal Hickel had created for the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), which was based on a motion capture performance.[44]

For Rogue One, Hickel had collected various shots from the original Star Wars films of starships that had been created with physical models and motion control camera systems. He brought this collection to The Mandalorian as a style guide for how the Razor Crest should look and move. Favreau decided that he wanted a miniature model of the Razor Crest for lighting reference;[44] the models for the series were created with a combination of 3D printing and hand sculpting.[46] After seeing the model, Favreau suggested that a single shot be filmed using motion control techniques as further reference for the CGI. The series had not budgeted for this technique, which is more expensive than using CGI. ILM visual effects supervisor John Knoll built a new motion control rig for the series to use that he described as "garage operation style, quick and dirty".[44][46] They went on to film 14 or 15 shots for the first season using the technique, and the remaining CGI shots of the Razor Crest in space were designed to emulate the model and motion control style.[44]

Other visual effects
Shots of the child where visual effects were used instead of the puppet include some scenes where the character is walking, and a scene where he eats a frog.[46] For these, the visual effects team studied the inner workings of the puppet to ensure that their version matched its physical limitations.[7][46]

Image Engine also created visual effects for the series, particularly in "Chapter 3: The Sin" and "Chapter 6: The Prisoner".[48]

Music
Composer Ludwig Göransson first met with Favreau in November 2018,[49] when Favreau showed Göransson concept art for the series and discussed his inspirations for the story and tone, including Western and samurai films.[50] After they began discussing the series, Favreau sent all of the season's scripts to Göransson.[50] The composer worked on his own for a month, spending 10 hours a day in his studio "going from instrument to instrument" and experimenting with different sounds.[49] He wrote five or six different pieces of music during this time as potential themes for the series.[51] One of the first instruments Göransson experimented with was the recorder. He found a bass recorder that he felt sounded unique, and digitally manipulated it to make it more "futuristic". That became the beginning of the series' main theme.[50] Favreau and Filoni both approved of Göransson's initial concepts, especially his use of the recorder which Göransson described as "a very original, distinct, lonely sound that follows this gunslinger on his journey."[49]

Favreau wanted the music to come from the perspective of the Mandalorian, serving as a replacement for the character's facial expressions since he is always wearing a helmet.[50] The Mandalorian's theme that Göransson initially wrote for Favreau is used during the end credits,[52] with Göransson writing different end credits cues for some of the episodes. The style of the series' end credits was designed around the score due to Favreau's love of Göransson's music.[53] Göransson also wrote themes for supporting characters such as Greef Karga and Cara Dune,[49] a theme for the Razor Crest, one for all the Mandalorians, and a travelling theme.[52] When he first approached "The Child", Göransson wrote music closer to John Williams' work for the Star Wars films since he felt the character was the element of the series that was closest to the films. He also felt it was natural for the character's music to be "cute". However, Favreau did not want this to be the direction for the character since the Mandalorian does not consider the child to be cute.[50] Elements of Göransson's original music for the child are introduced later on as the Mandalorian sees the child begin to use the Force. Göransson wanted to differentiate the sound of each episode, but also considered his score for the first season to be like a score for a single film with the main themes appearing in each episode and developing across the whole season.[54]

When Göransson began composing the music for specific scenes, he recorded himself playing the main instruments and then augmented those recordings with synthesizers and other digital manipulation. This was then combined with recordings of a 70-piece orchestra. The orchestra was recorded in Los Angeles from April to September 2019, and featured many musicians who were recording Williams' score for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) at the same time.[49] Göransson oversaw the recording of the score with his wife, musician Serena McKinney.[53] He wrote four hours of music for the first season. This was the most music he had written for a single project at that time, and he worked on the season longer than any other project at that point.[49] A soundtrack album was released digitally alongside the debut of each episode featuring music from that episode.[49]

Marketing
On October 4, 2018, the first promotional image from the series was released, featuring a Mandalorian with a rifle.[18] About a week later, Favreau released a photo through his official Instagram account featuring a rifle with a two-pronged barrel, an apparent callback to Boba Fett's weapon in The Star Wars Holiday Special.[55][56] Jon Favreau, Dave Filoni, and the main cast hosted a panel for The Mandalorian at Star Wars Celebration Chicago on April 14, 2019, where the first footage premiered to fans in attendance.[57] The first official poster and trailer were released at the D23 Expo on August 23, 2019.[58][59] A second and final trailer was released on October 28, 2019.[60] On November 11, a sneak peek was released during Monday Night Football.[61]

"The Child" merchandise
Favreau chose not to reveal "The Child" in any marketing for the series after a discussion with Donald Glover during the making of The Lion King in which Glover noted that audiences appreciate being surprised since it does not happen very much (Glover gave the surprise release of a Beyoncé album as an example).[16] Favreau stated that Disney was on board with this decision,[7] even though it meant they were unable to begin work on merchandise featuring the character before he was revealed in the series premiere in November 2019. This was due to the potential for those merchandise plans to leak and reveal the character early, and meant that merchandise of the character could not be ready for the Christmas and holiday season.[16] After the series premiered, "The Child" became a breakout character with more attention on social media and in news stories about it (1,161) than any of the Democrats running for president at the time.[7] By the end of November 2019 there was huge demand for merchandise featuring the character. Disney's merchandising unit had begun planning for the character, but had only released T-shirts featuring concept art so far. Companies such as Hasbro had begun work on "The Child" merchandise as well, but it would not be ready until 2020. A large amount of unofficial merchandise began to appear ahead of the holiday season.[9]

Release
Streaming and broadcast
The season premiered on Disney+ on the streaming service's United States launch day, November 12, 2019.[62] The second episode was released on November 15, with weekly releases for subsequent episodes.[63] The seventh episode was released early on December 18 so it could include a sneak preview of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which was released on December 20.[64] When Disney+ became available in several European countries in late March 2020, episodes of the season were again made available weekly despite the full season having already been released in other territories, an approach that James Whitbrook of io9 described as "perplexing" and "dumb".[65] The first two episodes were made available at launch in the countries on March 24, 2020, followed by the third on March 27, which each subsequent episode released weekly.[66] "Chapter 1: The Mandalorian" aired on ABC, Freeform, and FX on February 24, 2023, in anticipation of the season three premiere on March 1, 2023.[67]

Home media
The season was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on December 12, 2023, with Steelbook packaging and concept art cards.[68] It included two featurettes, "Remnants of the Empire" that looks at the Imperial design within the series, and "Forging the Covert: Part One" with Favreau, Filoni, and other crew members examining the creation of the Child, the Mandalorian's arsenal, and the season's practical and digital effects.[69]

Season 1 (2019): Percentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[70]

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average score of 8/10, based on 338 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "Action-packed and expertly-crafted—if at times a bit too withholding—The Mandalorian is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe that benefits greatly from the cuteness of its cargo."[70] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[71]

Zaki Hasan of the San Francisco Chronicle said the show "in essence allows the franchise to take a mulligan with Boba Fett. Take the look, take that ineffable 'cool,' and transfer it over to an entirely new character who offers an untouched canvas, while giving the audience something that feels familiar." He added, "Three episodes in, that's really all The Mandalorian is: a feeling. A good feeling, mind you, but rather than any specific storytelling quality, it's that feeling you're talking about. The visual effects, the sound effects, the overall look of the thing is all bang-on. This is a polished production that shows off every cent of its feature film budget on every frame of its run time."[72] Writing for The Ringer, Micah Peters said, "The Mandalorian may already be difficult to care about as something more than an installment that exists solely to set up the next installment. But there are still many enjoyable things about it, and also it's a Disney show with spaceships and giant sea slugs, so it doesn't need to be Citizen Kane. It might, however, be the next great TV Western."[73] Rating the show with an 8 out of 10, Laura Prudom from IGN considered that the series succeeded where the sequel trilogy failed which is the creation of a story for Star Wars as the series "has the swagger and ambition to venture off the beaten path and into the uncharted regions of the Star Wars galaxy, delivering a freshman season that - while uneven - still manages to be one of the most surprising and satisfying Star Wars projects in decades."[74]

While reviewing the season's finale, Sonia Saraiya from Vanity Fair highlighted the performances as "enthusiastic and spirited" which she considers to be an essential part to understand the characters motive, while also adding the importance of the family in the Star Wars franchise and said in her review, "The Mandalorian brings found family out of the subtext and into the foreground. So much of baby Yoda's power is not in his ability to manipulate the Force, but in how nakedly he wears his helpless innocence. His vulnerability cows and moves others around him when mere force can't; it polarizes the universe into the people willing to protect him, and the ones that aren't. Just as the Mandalorians found Din Djarin and rescued him because he was helpless, so Din will do the same for another creature—an expression of obligation to the innocent that Star Wars has never quite articulated before. Around father and child gather an unlikely crew of kindly mechanic, blustering bounty hunter, Alderaani refugee-turned-mercenary, and killer nurse-droid, drawn together by the loss of everything else—and the desire to nurture a little seed of the future. It is a relief and a joy to see that The Mandalorian knows what it is here to do; it knows who it is fighting for."[75] Fionnuala Halligan of the Screen Daily wrote, "From the aforementioned bars, to market sequences, the jabbering Jawas with their moveable fortress, to blistering sunsets in the sand, The Mandalorian makes a pilgrimage to pay its respects to the cinematic origins of this series. Production design by Andrew L. Jones draws from the past with reverence. Pretty soon, though, Favreau and his team are adding their own iconography, whether that be the immovable helmet, a floating crib, or the sight of The Mandalorian himself in his full Mescar [sic] armour as he cradles a small package in the manner of Chow Yun-fat in Hard Boiled."[76]

Reviewing the show for Metro, Keith Watson gave the series 3 of 5 stars adding, "Two words: Baby Yoda. Almost single-handedly the cute critter has given this Star Wars spin-off a meme-led profile that will distract from the realisation that, although it's undoubtedly an imaginatively staged entry in the iconic sci-fi franchise universe, the action does get ploddy at times. The timeline lands us between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens as we follow bounty hunter The Mandalorian — or Mando to his chums, if he had any — a masked mystery man (pictured top) who reveals a soft side when confronted with the aforementioned infant Yoda. Their bonding is cute or cringy, depending on your sentimentality levels."[77] As a fanatic from Star Wars and writing to Forbes, Erik Kain called the show as a "visually sumptuous adventure through the dirtier, less glorified corridors of the Star Wars universe", and deemed the show as the best return to Star Wars since Return of the Jedi. Kain also praised Göransson's score, deeming it as one of the highlights of the show and calling it a perfect way to capture the music of Star Wars and a classic western.[78] While reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Time, Richard Roeper rated the show with 3 and half stars of 4, noting Baby Yoda as "an instant contender for most adorable creature in the Star Wars universe" and lauding the references of the series to the spaghetti western genre. Roeper also praised Pascal's performance noting his "distinctive personality through his line readings and the physicality of the character", describing him as a "Clint Eastwood in Robocop armor".[79]

Audience viewership
Within four days of its release, The Mandalorian had stronger U.S. demand compared to four of 2019's biggest streaming originals: Netflix's The Umbrella Academy, When They See Us, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and Amazon Prime Video's Good Omens. However, it registered less than 40% of the demand of Netflix's Stranger Things and was behind other established shows such as DC Universe's Titans, nor was it in the top 10 for the most in-demand shows across all TV networks and digital services for the week of November 10–16. TV Time, a popular app allowing users to track shows and movies they are watching (or want to watch), stated though that the number of people interested in The Mandalorian had doubled for the following week, and noted that it had the largest gain of any TV show.[80]

   – LOW–risk: knowingly embraced but gets softened by surrogate-dad arc.

   – Lone warrior discovers hidden caretaking heart via Baby Yoda.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: emotional beats echo Léon / Logan / Last of Us.

C. Badass Woman Sidekick  
   – Cara Dune fills the tough-as-nails mercenary slot.  
   – LOW–risk: given agency, but her presence checks the “muscle-mom” box.

   – IG-11 flips from killer to nanny.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: redemptive-robot trope à la T2, Rogue One.

E. Honour-Bound Warrior Culture

   – LOW–risk: enriches lore but mirrors countless samurai-code stories.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME CLICHÉS
A. “Job-of-the-Week” Quest Structure  
   – Each chapter = fetch-quest or bounty gone wrong.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: video-game cadence can feel episodic filler.

B. Abandoned Imperial Remnant  
   – Post-Empire warlords as stock villains.  
   – LOW–risk: expected in timeline, but lightly sketched menace.

   – Lone Ronin meets High-Noon gunfights; Episode 4 is Seven Samurai in space.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: faithful homage verging on pastiche.

D. Cute-Creature Merch Magnet  
   – The Child weaponizes adorableness and plot protection.  
   – LOW–risk: effective, yet obvious “marketable mascot” move.

E. Unmasking = Climax of Trust  
   – Helmet removal held until finale for emotional punch.  
   – LOW–risk: familiar payoff from Dredd/Lone Ranger templates.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY/STYLE CLICHÉS
A. Dusty Western Color Grade  
   – Desert ochres and steel blues signal frontier grit.  
   – LOW–risk: stylish but standard genre shorthand.

B. Swell-to-Silence Shoot-Outs  
   – Musical stingers drop out for blaster-fire crescendos.  
   – LOW–risk: common action timing trick.

C. “Volume” Back-Lot Grandeur  
   – StageCraft vistas give postcard sunsets every episode.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: breathtaking yet occasionally video-game flat.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS
A. Episodic Cameo Carousel  
   – Rotating guest stars (Sedaris, Burr, Wen) = “side-mission NPC.”  
   – MEDIUM–risk: fun but can undercut serialized stakes.

B. Cliffhanger MacGuffin Reveal  
   – Darksaber stinger tees up next season.  
   – LOW–risk: classic franchise breadcrumb.

C. “Village Under Siege” Detour  
   – Chapter 4 repeats Magnificent Seven trope beat-for-beat.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: comfort-food familiarity borders on copy-paste.

D. Self-Sacrificing Droid Finale  
   – IG-11’s noble suicide echoes Spock/T-800.  
   – LOW–risk: still lands emotionally but well-worn.

E. Helmet Code vs. Identity Crisis  
   – Rule-of-the-mask creates inevitable “who am I?” theme.  
   – MEDIUM–risk: predictable yet essential to arc.

To clarify, here's my original request:

I'm going to give you info on some films i love. I want you to find which of our cliches they contain (only low/medium risk clichés though, I don't want to include high-risk ones) so I can get a better idea of which cliches I'm prone to accept -- clichés that don't bother me as much.

Then I added:

Exclude high risk. Don't even mention them.

  42. Montage as Collective Action (Medium Risk – 2 Alternatives)

  46. Constructive Cut Design (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)

    - Alternative 2: Let scene transitions mirror tonal progression (e.g., from disarray to stillness).
    - Alternative 3: Reserve fast cuts for spiraling inner states, not just action tempo.
  47. Palette as Emotional Language (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)

    - Alternative 2: Let cold-to-warm gradients reflect internal changes across acts.
    - Alternative 3: Use specific lighting conditions (fluorescents, sodium light, natural daylight) as thematic indicators.
IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES
  48. Alien Design Suggesting Internal Logic (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Creature aesthetics prioritize biological plausibility and emotional resonance over flashy visuals.
    - Alternative 1: Use understated traits (e.g., asymmetry, subtle bioluminescence) to evoke dread without grotesquery.
    - Alternative 2: Imply function behind design—features adapted to sensory or survival needs.
    - Alternative 3: Let alien behavior define fear, with design as reinforcement rather than centerpiece.
  49. Weapon Improvisation Reflecting Theme (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Makeshift tools arise naturally from setting and characters’ personal familiarity with their environment.
    - Alternative 1: Tie improvised weapons to emotionally significant objects.
    - Alternative 2: Highlight problem-solving under pressure rather than "coolness."
    - Alternative 3: Allow the final tool to reflect collective trust or sacrifice (e.g., built collaboratively).
  50. Symbolism Emerging from Relationship (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Objects and actions accrue meaning through repetition and context rather than being pre-loaded with significance.
    - Alternative 1: Let a casual object gain weight over time (e.g., a borrowed lighter, a shared radio).
    - Alternative 2: Use visual callbacks rather than exposition to communicate symbolic resonance.
    - Alternative 3: Build emotional payoff through use, not through explanation.
  51. Plot Twists That Reflect Character Choice (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Turns in story direction result from accumulated behavior and internal tension.
    - Alternative 1: Frame the twist as an inevitable result of a past decision, not chance.
    - Alternative 2: Link the reversal directly to a protagonist’s strength or flaw.
    - Alternative 3: Allow foreshadowing to seed discomfort rather than hinting at a specific reveal.
  52. Supporting Characters as Emotional Echoes (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Minor characters mirror or refract the protagonist’s journey without being author surrogates.
    - Alternative 1: Base them on conflicting or parallel philosophies, not exposition.
    - Alternative 2: Give them arcs with separate stakes that enrich theme.
    - Alternative 3: Allow their pivotal choices to shift the protagonist’s path without overshadowing it.
  53. Group Heroism with Gradual Payoff (High Risk – 3 Alternatives)
    - Climactic rescues are grounded in setup, small signals, and interpersonal evolution.
    - Alternative 1: Foreshadow collective resilience through past shared obstacles.
    - Alternative 2: Let each character contribute meaningfully to the final push, no matter how small.
    - Alternative 3: Frame teamwork as emotional logic, not tactical convenience.
  54. Closing Credits That Extend Theme (Low Risk – 1 Alternative)
    - Final moments deepen emotional tone rather than reset to spectacle.
    - Alternative: Pair closing images with ambient sound or epilogues that reveal character or world-state aftermath.

Low- & Medium-Risk Clichés Evident in The Mandalorian — Season 1
(Numbers refer to your master list; anything High-Risk is omitted by request.)

#	Cliché Label	Season-1 Examples
1. Enriched Character Archetypes (Low)	The familiar “mysterious gunslinger” is re-imagined as Din Djarin, whose covert upbringing, warrior creed and trauma with droids give the stock role new texture.	
2. Internal Conflict & Redemption (Low)	His bounty-hunter pragmatism collides with buried compassion, launching a redemptive arc once he violates Guild code to save Grogu.	
3. Evolving Romantic Subplot (Medium)	Subtle sparks with Omera on Sorgan arise from mutual vulnerability, not plot obligation, and dissolve when he must keep Grogu safe.	
4. Integrated Mentors & Allies (Medium)	Kuiil’s steady guidance, the Armorer’s counsel, and Cara Dune’s camaraderie carry thematic weight while shaping Din’s growth.	
15. Inevitable Consequence Catalyst (Low)	The covert Imperial remnant’s obsession with Grogu springs from prior Empire hubris, setting the whole chase in motion.	
16. Visual Stillness Before Chaos (Low)	Quiet wide shots of empty deserts or ice flats precede ambushes, dogfights, or beast attacks, foreshadowing danger.	
17. Earned Rescue Transition (Low)	The covert Mandalorians expose themselves to save Din only after his moral cost—betraying the Guild—has been paid.	
18. Solitary Transformation Moment (Low)	Alone in his ship, Din reaches for the lever-ball Grogu loves—an unspoken decision to become protector, not hunter.	
20. Evocative Environmental Mood (Low)	Desolate frontier worlds (Arvala-7 mudflats, Sorgan swamps) reinforce the “space-western” mood without showy exposition.	
21. Thematic Final Echo (Low)	Final shot of Din jet-packing away with Grogu mirrors the opener’s lone-gunman silhouette, now altered by paternal purpose.	
22. Foreshadowed Peripheral Victory (Medium)	IG-11’s compassion sub-routine is planted when Kuiil reprograms him; it pays off as the droid’s self-sacrifice in the finale.	
23. Preparatory Rhythmic Montage (Medium)	Episode 4’s villagers-train-for-battle montage ties each beat (spear practice, trench digging) to their fear and resolve.	
24. False Hope at Midpoint (Medium)	Din believes the Child is safe after delivery (Ep 3) — a fleeting win that’s immediately undercut by the Empire’s true intent.	
25. Character-Driven Chase Stakes (Medium)	Speeder-bike and space-pursuit beats hinge on Din’s bond with Grogu (cradle-cam POV, frantic glances) more than raw speed.	
26. Minimalist Slow-Motion Emphasis (Medium)	Brief slo-mo as the AT-ST crashes into the swamp spotlights the villagers’ mix of awe and dread rather than pure spectacle.	
27. Purposeful Subjective Camerawork (Medium)	Helmet POVs (thermal scans, rifle scope) share Din’s tactical mindset, then pull back for clarity once he asserts control.	
39. Stillness as Mood Foundation (Low)	Opening cantina door-slide and silent stare-down sets a laconic tone before violence erupts.	
40. Thematic Visual Echo (Low)	The child’s floating pram drifting beside Din in Ep 1’s close reprises in Ep 8—now battered, symbolizing shared ordeal.	
41. Chase w/ Emotional Geometry (Medium)	The ice-planet dogfight cuts between cockpit close-ups and exterior rolls, mapping Din’s resolve and the Razor Crest’s limits.	
42. Montage as Collective Action (Medium)	Forge sequences intercut sparks, hammer blows, and whispered creed—group ritual over flashy speed-ramping.	
43. Purposeful Slow Motion (Medium)	The moment Din lifts off with his new jet-pack is slowed and scored sparsely, isolating his leap of faith.	
44. Grounded Subjective Camera (Medium)	Handheld stumble-cam follows Din after flamethrower wounds (Ep 8), tethering us to disorientation until IG-11 stabilizes him.	
54. Closing Credits That Extend Theme (Low)	Concept-art tableaux plus Göransson’s lonely recorder reprise deepen frontier mystique instead of pivoting to promo hype.	

These are the low- and medium-risk tropes that Season 1 leans on — the kinds of clichés you seem comfortable embracing.

Here's an example of the format of an acceptable response you provided (in plain-text within code-fences):
Sinners (Ryan Coogler, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES
  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke as the disillusioned protector, Annie as the grounded healer, Sammie as the conflicted prodigy.
    - These roles start archetypal but gain layered motives, contradictions, and emotional depth.
  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke’s unresolved grief, Mary’s guilt over passing, Stack’s moral fracture.
    - Each internal struggle is meaningfully tied to the story’s theme of community sacrifice and legacy.
  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie and Pearline’s tender courtship; Stack and Mary’s mournful rekindling.
    - These arcs evolve from shared pain, trust, and temptation rather than genre-convenient chemistry.
  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Annie’s knowledge of folk defense; Delta Slim’s blues mysticism.
    - Their support emerges from existing roles and accumulated wisdom, not plot convenience.
II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES
  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie’s transcendent performance unwittingly draws spirits and Remmick’s attention.
    - The threat rises organically from character-driven actions rooted in legacy and desire.
  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: A hushed joint before Sammie plays; a still field before sunrise.
    - Stillness and ambient tension precede every major eruption of violence or possession.
  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke’s death followed by Sammie’s walk into daylight.
    - The tonal descent into loss is resolved by quiet survival, not cinematic excess.
  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke cradling Annie before euthanizing her.
    - A moment of internal collapse anchors the moral cost of the fight.
  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Grace’s invitation breaks the safety threshold; Slim dies at the keys.
    - This beat is visualized as both physical defeat and emotional devastation.
  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The blues circle closes when Sammie plays for the vampires who spared him.
    - A visual and thematic callback to his transformative first performance.
  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Sammie smashing the silver guitar—long foreshadowed—as the pivotal act.
    - The climax is driven by a previously marginalized character completing a hidden arc.
  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Montage of community prepping garlic, silver, and spiritual protections.
    - Grounded in character skills and communal memory, not genre shorthand.
  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Belief that vampire-proofing is sufficient, just before betrayal and threshold breach.
    - Hints of doubt are subtly planted before the safety collapses.
III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES
  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Panning over cotton fields, the sawmill, and the moonlit road to the joint.
    - These shots set tone without over-explanation, using natural detail to induce dread.
  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Still wide shot of the dance floor before Remmick’s arrival.
    - Cinematic calm used for maximum foreboding, not spectacle.
  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sammie performing for Stack mirrors his youthful first gig.
    - Cinematic closure is earned via image, not narration or exposition.
  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Smoke chasing Mary through sugarcane lit by lanterns.
    - Movement and geography reflect character intent, not just plot propulsion.
  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Characters sealing cracks, loading buckshot, mixing herbs.
    - Rhythmically cut but grounded in action that reflects emotional readiness.
  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Silver strings snapping as Sammie swings his guitar.
    - Used once, with emotional weight—never gratuitously.
  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV when Stack turns vampire, surrounded by blurred memory flashes.
    - Emotional and symbolic rather than disorienting.
IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES
  21. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Remmick’s unsettling stillness, pale Irish corpse-features, understated menace.
    - Horror is suggested through silence, posture, and unnatural behavior, not exaggeration.
  22. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Use of a silver-stringed guitar and pickled garlic juice.
    - Iconic tools tied directly to the characters’ culture and available resources.
  23. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Smoke seeing Annie and their child in his final vision.
    - Symbolism arises from character arcs, not external plot contrivances.

The Mandalorian — Season 1  (Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni, 2019) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES
 1. Enriched Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Din Djarin starts as the “faceless gunslinger,” but creed flashbacks, droid trauma,
      and covert loyalties deepen the archetype beyond surface cool.
 2. Internal Conflict and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - His crisis of conscience after handing Grogu to the Client sparks a season-long
      atonement arc that drives every subsequent choice.
 3. Evolving Romantic Subplots (Medium Risk)
    - Quiet trust and mutual vulnerability with Omera hint at romance that grows
      organically, then pauses when duty to the child overrides desire.
 4. Integrated Mentors and Allies (Medium Risk)
    - Kuiil, Cara Dune, the Armorer, and IG-11 all enter through shared circumstance
      and remain consistent emotional anchors, not plug-in plot devices.

II. NARRATIVE / THEME-AFFECTING TROPES
 5. Inevitable Consequence Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - Imperial obsession with Grogu—born of past hubris—triggers every bounty, chase,
      and double-cross that follows.
 6. Visual Stillness Before Chaos (Low Risk)
    - Wide, silent vistas (ice-world cantina door; Arvala-7 dusk) precede sudden
      shoot-outs or creature attacks, telegraphing upheaval.
 7. Earned Rescue Transition (Low Risk)
    - Clan-in-hiding Mandalorians reveal themselves only after Din’s moral price—
      betraying the Guild—has been fully paid.
 8. Solitary Transformation Moment (Low Risk)
    - Alone in the cockpit, Din fingers the silver shift-knob Grogu loves, wordlessly
      choosing caretaker over killer.
 9. Evocative Environmental Mood (Low Risk)
    - Desolate deserts, dank lava tunnels, and swampy Sorgan all reinforce the
      frontier-Western tone without expository dialogue.
10. Thematic Final Echo (Low Risk)
    - Last shot: Din blasts skyward with jet-pack and child, mirroring his opening
      loner silhouette now redefined by guardianship.
11. Foreshadowed Peripheral Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Kuiil’s gentle reprogramming of IG-11 seeds the droid’s later self-sacrifice and
      healing role, avoiding deus ex machina feel.
12. Preparatory Rhythmic Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Episode 4 trains villagers via hand-held spears, trench digging, and anxious
      glances—cut to rhythm that stresses fear, not swagger.
13. False Hope at Midpoint (Medium Risk)
    - Din believes Grogu safe after delivery (Ep 3); the illusion crumbles when he
      spies Pershing’s lab and hears the Child’s cries.
14. Character-Driven Chase Stakes (Medium Risk)
    - Space dog-fight cuts between Din’s helmet POV and Grogu’s rattling crib,
      binding tension to paternal panic rather than spectacle.
15. Minimalist Slow-Motion Emphasis (Medium Risk)
    - Single slo-mo beat of AT-ST’s flaming crash lets villagers’ awe and disbelief
      land before tempo resumes.
16. Purposeful Subjective Camerawork (Medium Risk)
    - Helmet HUD, thermal scans, and shaky flamethrower shots place viewers inside
      Din’s fear, then pivot to steady framing once control returns.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES
17. Stillness as Mood Foundation (Low Risk)
    - Opening cantina doorway holds on an unmoving tableau before violence breaks,
      establishing laconic frontier tension.
18. Thematic Visual Echo (Low Risk)
    - Grogu’s hover-pram gliding beside Din in Ep 1 recurs scorched in Ep 8,
      visually charting their joint ordeal.
19. Chase Sequences with Emotional Geometry (Medium Risk)
    - Ice-world aerial dog-fight maps Razor Crest flips to cockpit close-ups,
      linking spatial turns to Din’s problem-solving grit.
20. Montage as Collective Action (Medium Risk)
    - Forge sequences intercut sparks, armor plates, and Mandalorian oath whispers,
      emphasizing shared ritual over flashy cuts.
21. Purposeful Slow Motion (Medium Risk)
    - Jet-pack ignition in finale slows frames and drops score, isolating Din’s leap
      of faith rather than glamorizing action.
22. Grounded Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Hand-held stagger follows Din’s bloody crawl after Gideon’s blast, locking us
      to his wavering consciousness until IG-11 steadies him.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR / MISCELLANEOUS TROPES
23. Closing Credits That Extend Theme (Low Risk)
    - Concept-art tableaux plus lonely recorder motif deepen frontier mystique
      instead of defaulting to upbeat franchise fanfare.

Super 8 is a 2011 American science fiction thriller film written and directed by J.J. Abrams and co-produced by Steven Spielberg. The film stars Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler in lead roles. Set in 1979, the plot follows a group of young teenagers who witness a mysterious train derailment while filming their own Super 8 movie. As strange occurrences unfold in their small Ohio town, they realize that something dangerous has been unleashed from the train.

Filmed in Weirton, West Virginia, Super 8 blends elements of mystery, science fiction, and coming-of-age drama, drawing comparisons to iconic films like E.T. and The Goonies for its nostalgic tone, while offering a darker twist on those familiar themes. Released on June 10, 2011, Super 8 received positive reviews from critics and was a moderate box office success, grossing over $260 million worldwide.[2]

Super 8 received 4 nominations at the 17th Critics' Choice Awards, including Best Action Movie and Best Young Actor/Actress (Fanning). The film received 8 nominations at the 38th Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, and won 3 awards – Best Director (Abrams), Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Courtney) and Best Music (Michael Giacchino). Fanning also received a nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance at the 2012 MTV Movie Awards.

Plot
In 1979, Deputy Sherriff Jack Lamb of Lillian, Ohio and his 14-year-old son Joe mourn the death of wife and mother Elizabeth in a workplace accident. Jack blames Elizabeth's co-worker Louis Dainard for the accident, as Elizabeth had to cover his shift while Dainard recovered from a hangover. Joe clings to his mom's memory in the form of a locket.

Four months later, Joe's friend Charles is making a zombie movie for a Super 8 film competition. He enlists Joe's help along with friends Preston, Martin, and Cary, as well as Dainard's daughter, Alice. Though their fathers are opposed to their friendship, Joe and Alice become close.

While filming at a train depot at midnight, a train approaches and a pickup truck rams the train head-on, derailing it and destroying the depot. The children are separated in the fiery chaos. The kids regroup and find crates of strange white cubes amid the wreckage before discovering the truck driver to be their biology teacher Dr. Woodward. Gravely injured, he warns them at gunpoint to forget what they have seen. They flee, as a convoy from the local Air Force base, led by Col. Nelec, arrives. Nelec finds an empty Super 8 film box.

In the following days the town experiences strange events: dogs run away, several townspeople go missing, the electrical power fluctuates, and electronic items are stolen. Jack approaches Nelec, but Nelec arrests him. Nelec orders flamethrowers to start a wildfire as an excuse to evacuate the residents to the base. Joe and Charles watch their derailment footage and see that a large creature escaped the train. Nelec confronts Woodward in a military hospital, seeking information about the creature, but when Woodward rebukes him, Nelec has him killed with a lethal injection.

Louis tells Joe the creature has abducted Alice. Joe, Charles, Martin, and Cary persuade Jen, Charles's older sister, to flirt with Donny so he can get them into town to rescue Alice. Breaking into Dr. Woodward's trailer they find documents and a film from his time as a government researcher.

The film and tape recorder reveal that, in 1963, the Air Force captured an alien when it crash-landed. They experimented on the alien, while withholding its space craft, composed of the strange white cubes, which allowed the craft to shape-shift. The alien had established a psychic connection with Woodward, convincing him to help it escape Earth, but Nelec sabotaged, discredited, and discharged Woodward. While the kids are watching the film, Nelec captures them, but the alien kills Nelec and the airmen, allowing the kids to escape. Jack escapes and agrees with Louis to put their differences aside to save their kids.

The military attacks the alien, but their hardware goes haywire in its presence, resulting in significant collateral damage. Joe and Cary find a massive tunnel system under the town. The missing townsfolk, including Alice, are hanging unconscious from the ceiling of a cavern. Here, the alien is creating a device, constructed from the missing electronics, and attached to the base of the water tower. Using firecrackers as a distraction, Joe frees Alice and the others. The alien grabs Joe, who quietly speaks to it, convincing that it could "still live" while bad things happen. Establishing an emotional connection between the two of them, the alien realizes that not all humans are as bad as Nelec and spares him, allowing them to return to the surface.

Everyone watches as metal objects from the town are pulled to the top of the tower by an unknown force. The white cubes reassemble to create a spaceship and, as the alien enters it, the locket in Joe's pocket is drawn toward the tower. After a moment, he lets it go, completing the ship. As the ship rises into space, Joe takes Alice's hand.

The detective-zombie short film the children were making in Super 8 runs at the end of the movie beside the credit roll. In it, Charles asks for his short film "The Case" to be picked for a local film festival before being attacked by Alice as a zombie.

Bicycles used in the movie Super 8 on display at Bicycle Heaven
J. J. Abrams initially conceived Super 8 by combining two distinct ideas: one about kids making a movie during the 1970s, and another focused on a large-scale alien invasion. The concept began when Abrams thought of a scene featuring a factory's "Accident-Free" sign, which later grew into a more complex storyline. He ultimately merged the two ideas, feeling that the "kids' movie" concept alone might not draw enough attention from audiences.

Abrams collaborated with Steven Spielberg and others to develop the plot.[3] Despite early speculation that Super 8 was connected to Abrams' 2008 film Cloverfield, he quickly denied the rumor, clarifying that Super 8 was its own standalone project.[4] Primary filming for the movie began in the fall of 2010, while the teaser trailer was shot separately in April of that year.[5] Super 8 became the first original J. J. Abrams project produced by Amblin Entertainment, Bad Robot, and Paramount Pictures.[6]

To cast the film's lead roles, Abrams held a national talent search to find fresh faces for the young characters. Joel Courtney, who had initially auditioned for a commercial, was chosen because Abrams saw something "different" in him. Riley Griffiths secured his role by submitting a self-taped audition.

Filming
Filming for Super 8 took place in Weirton, West Virginia, from September 20 to December 16, 2010.[7] To help promote the film, Valve Corporation created a short video game segment, which was included alongside certain versions of Portal 2, enhancing the film's marketing efforts.[8]

Initially, director J.J. Abrams intended to shoot all the footage for the fictional movie within the film, "The Case", on Super-8 film stock. However, this plan was abandoned due to challenges faced by Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), who found it difficult to integrate CGI into the grainy Super-8 footage. As a result, cinematographer Larry Fong opted to use Super-16 film for scenes that required visual effects, ensuring smoother CGI integration while maintaining a similar aesthetic.[9]

Music
Main article: Super 8 (soundtrack)
The score for the film was composed by Michael Giacchino, Abrams' long-time collaborator. The soundtrack was released on June 13, 2011 by Varèse Sarabande. It won the 2012 Saturn Award for Best Music.

During the ending credits, the songs "Don't Bring Me Down" by Electric Light Orchestra and "My Sharona" by the Knack are featured. The Blondie song "Heart of Glass" and the Cars song "Bye Bye Love" are also featured in the film.

Marketing
Like Cloverfield (2008), an earlier J. J. Abrams-produced film, Super 8 utilized an elaborate viral marketing campaign to generate interest. The first teaser trailer, attached to Iron Man 2 in May 2010, introduced viewers to the premise of a freight train transporting contents from the decommissioned Area 51. A dramatic crash leads to the release of a mysterious entity, captured on a Super 8 camera. Sharp-eyed fans discovered a hidden message, "Scariest Thing I Ever Saw", embedded in the trailer's final frames. This clue led them to the website www.scariestthingieversaw.com, simulating an old PDP-11 computer system, with clues revealing that the computer belonged to Josh Woodward, son of Dr. Woodward, a key figure in the story.

In another layer of the viral campaign, a website for Rocket Poppeteers (a fictional brand like Slusho in Cloverfield) was launched, which didn't directly relate to the film's events but added to the mystery. The official Super 8 website featured an "editing room" section that invited users to collect clips from across the internet and stitch them together. Once assembled, the footage depicted the alien's ship disintegrating into white cubes and Dr. Woodward's ill-fated encounter with the alien.

Additionally, the video game Portal 2 included an interactive trailer where players could experience the train derailment scene from the movie, including the eerie sound of the alien breaking free from its containment.[8]

Release
The film was released on June 9, 2011, in Australia; June 10, 2011, in the United States; and August 5, 2011, in the United Kingdom.[10] On June 8, Paramount also launched a "Super 8 Sneak Peek" Twitter promotion, offering fans a chance to purchase tickets for an advance screening, taking place on June 9, 2011, in the United States.[11]

Home media
The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on November 22, 2011.[12] The release was produced as a combo pack with a digital copy, including nine bonus features and fourteen deleted scenes.[13] A 4K Blu-Ray edition was released on its tenth anniversary (May 24, 2021).[14]

Reception
Box office
Super 8 had a production budget of $50 million. It was commercially released on June 10, 2011. In the United States and Canada, it opened in 3,379 theaters and grossed over $35.4 million on its opening weekend, ranking first at the box office.[15] The film grossed $127 million in North America with a worldwide total of some $260 million.[2]

Critical response
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Super 8 holds an approval rating of 81% based on 296 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads: "It may evoke memories of classic summer blockbusters a little too eagerly for some, but Super 8 has thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth to spare."[16] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[17] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it a "B+" on an A+ to F scale.[18]

Chris Sosa of Gather gave the film an A rating, describing it as "a gripping and exciting tale of finding one's place in the world amidst tragedy." He praised the film's emotionally resonant storytelling, concluding that, "While the genre-bending occasionally unsettles, the film's genuine and emotionally gripping nature makes its journey believable."[19]

Critics offered varying opinions, with Roger Ebert awarding the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising it as a "nostalgic" tribute to earlier styles of filmmaking, where "audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action."[20] Similarly, Richard Corliss of Time called it "the year's most thrilling, feeling mainstream movie," placing it among his Top 10 Best Movies of 2011. Jamie Graham of Total Film gave it a 5-star review, noting that Abrams' storytelling ability makes him "a born storyteller".[21]

However, the film's ending drew polarized reactions. Some praised its emotional resonance, while others found it rushed and lacking. For instance, Fernando F. Croce of MUBI criticized the film for starting strong but ending poorly.[22] Moreover, the frequent homages to Steven Spielberg's early works drew mixed feedback; David Edelstein of New York Magazine referred to it as a "flagrant crib" of Spielberg's films, albeit one made with "the blessing of the master".[23]

Super 8 (J. J. Abrams, 2011) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES
 1. Enriched Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Joe = the quiet “kid next door” widened by grief, model-building hobby, and
      a make-up-effects talent that reframes the stock dreamer.
    - Deputy Jack = stern sheriff archetype complicated by guilt, single-parent
      panic, and a buried need to reconcile with Louis Dainard.
 2. Internal Conflict and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Joe’s obsession with his mother’s locket and Jack’s blame of Louis drive
      parallel arcs toward forgiveness and letting go.
 3. Evolving Romantic Subplots (Medium Risk)
    - Joe and Alice move from shy co-actors to emotional confidants; their bond
      grows through shared loss and danger, not obligatory sparks.
 4. Integrated Mentors and Allies (Medium Risk)
    - Charles’s director zeal, Cary’s pyro tricks, and Woodward’s cryptic warning
      all aid Joe’s growth through organically shared stakes.

II. NARRATIVE / THEME-AFFECTING TROPES
15. Inevitable Consequence Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - Air Force hubris—caging the alien and silencing Woodward—sets up the train
      crash and townwide crisis as payback for systemic neglect.
16. Visual Stillness Before Chaos (Low Risk)
    - Midnight depot: static wide of kids rehearsing before a head-on truck strike
      shatters the silence with explosive derailment.
17. Earned Rescue Transition (Low Risk)
    - Only after Joe risks his life underground and empathizes with the creature
      does the alien spare the kids and depart.
18. Solitary Transformation Moment (Low Risk)
    - On the water-tower roof Joe fingers the locket, chooses release, and accepts
      change in hushed isolation before the craft forms.
19. Symbolic Collapse of Hope (Low Risk)
    - The water tower—Lillian’s landmark—becomes the alien’s launch rig, turning a
      civic symbol into evidence that life in town will never be the same.
20. Evocative Environmental Mood (Low Risk)
    - Late-70s steel-town haze, flickering streetlights, and nocturnal cicadas all
      amplify nostalgia tinged with unease.
21. Thematic Final Echo (Low Risk)
    - Opening shot: Joe polishing Mom’s locket at the wake. Closing beat: he lets
      it fly magnetically to the ship—same object, transformed meaning.
22. Foreshadowed Peripheral Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Cary’s love of fireworks is seeded early, then pays off when his M-80
      barrage distracts the alien long enough for Joe to free Alice.
23. Preparatory Rhythmic Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Charles’s “production value” reshoot: quick cuts of zombie make-up,
      camera-track building, and whispered blocking underscore creative urgency.
24. False Hope at Midpoint (Medium Risk)
    - The military’s forced evacuation convinces townsfolk danger is handled—mere
      pages before Nelec torches the neighborhood and the kids learn worse truths.
25. Character-Driven Chase Stakes (Medium Risk)
    - School-bus escape intercuts Joe shielding Alice and Jack pursuing in a
      cruiser, tethering chase momentum to parent-child tension.
27. Purposeful Subjective Camerawork (Medium Risk)
    - Super-8 lens POV during crash and later alien glimpses mimic the kids’
      terrified vantage while staying legible.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES
39. Stillness as Mood Foundation (Low Risk)
    - Early sunrise tilt over frosted steel mill sets a mournful tone before any
      sci-fi hint emerges.
40. Thematic Visual Echo (Low Risk)
    - Initial row of model train cars on Joe’s dresser mirrored by real railcars
      spinning skyward in the finale—childish play to cosmic departure.
41. Chase Sequences with Emotional Geometry (Medium Risk)
    - Bus careens past toppled power lines; framing traps kids in tight windows,
      echoing how fear corrals their agency.
42. Montage as Collective Action (Medium Risk)
    - Kids load film, leaf through storyboards, and rehearse lines—hands, glue,
      and flashbulbs cut together to celebrate teamwork over pace.
43. Purposeful Slow Motion (Medium Risk)
    - The moment Cary’s firecracker sparks near spilled fuel slows briefly, giving
      palpable dread before the depot explosion.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR / MISCELLANEOUS TROPES
54. Closing Credits That Extend Theme (Low Risk)
    - The homemade zombie film “The Case” runs beside the credits, reaffirming
      youthful creativity and providing cathartic laughter after the spectacle.

Silent Hill 2 is a 2024 survival horror game developed by Bloober Team and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. It is a remake of the 2001 video game Silent Hill 2, originally developed by Team Silent, a group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo (KCET). It is the first major installment in the Silent Hill series since Silent Hill: Downpour (2012). Like the original game, it follows James Sunderland, a widower, who returns to the eponymous town in Maine upon receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, who claims to be waiting there for him.

The remake of Silent Hill 2 was officially announced in October 2022 following months of speculation and leaks. It was led by Bloober Team creative director Mateusz Lenart and produced by Motoi Okamoto from Konami.[1] Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka, who served as creature designer and composer for the original game, respectively, took an active part in development. According to Maciej Głomb, Ito provided concept art for locations and monsters while Yamaoka returned as a composer.[2]

Silent Hill 2 was released for PlayStation 5 and Windows on October 8, 2024, to very positive reviews. It has sold over two million units and earned several awards, including nominations at the British Academy Games Awards, the Golden Joystick Awards, and The Game Awards. Critics praised the game for its graphics, voice performances (particularly Roberts), setting and faithfulness to its source material, with many considering it a return to form for the franchise, as well as one of the best video games of 2024.

Gameplay
[icon]	
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2024)
The objective of Silent Hill 2 is to guide James Sunderland, the player character, through the titular town of Silent Hill as he searches for his wife and battles monsters. In contrast to its original counterpart, Silent Hill 2 features a modernized third-person camera system with an overhauled combat system.[3]

The game is structured into a series of areas and chapters, each representing a segment of James's psychological and emotional journey. These areas include streets, buildings, hospitals, apartments, and the infamous Silent Hill locations like Brookhaven Hospital and the Lakeview Hotel. Players explore detailed, dimly lit environments using a flashlight and map to navigate. Many areas require key items to progress, found by solving puzzles or defeating enemies. Environmental storytelling and ambient sound design play a major role in creating a tense, immersive experience. Players have access to various melee weapons (like planks and pipes) and firearms (such as pistols and shotguns). Combat is clunky by design, enhancing the vulnerability of the protagonist. Conserving ammunition and health items is critical, as resources are limited. The game features numerous puzzles ranging from simple key-finding to abstract riddles. Puzzle difficulty can be set separately from combat difficulty, affecting how complex the solutions are. Some puzzles require interpreting notes, environmental clues, or symbolic logic. Silent Hill 2 features multiple endings based on how players behave throughout the game: health item usage, behavior toward companion characters, time spent in certain areas. These endings reflect James's psychological state and provide different interpretations of the story.[4]

Synopsis
Setting
Silent Hill 2 is set in the small resort town of Silent Hill in Maine.[5][6] Shrouded in a thick fog, the town is apparently abandoned and unkempt, but Silent Hill presents a seemingly shifting infrastructure, in which the player experiences an even more worn and decaying version of the town, and the Otherworld, marked by rust, wire fences, and an encompassing darkness.[6][7] It is implied that the town's appearance is subjective to the beholder; where some see fog, others may see fire or ice.[8]

The playable character is James Sunderland (Luke Roberts), a man drawn to the town by the possibility of seeing his deceased wife, Mary (Salóme Gunnarsdóttir).[6][9][10] During his exploration of Silent Hill, James encounters Angela Orosco (Gianna Kiehl), a troubled and suicidal nineteen-year-old girl searching for her mother; Eddie Dombrowski (Danny Kirrane [appearance], Scott Haining [voice]), an overweight, bullied, and paranoid man;[10][11] and Laura (Evie Templeton), a mischievous but innocent eight-year-old girl who knew Mary when she was alive and dislikes James.[10] James also meets Maria (Gunnarsdóttir), a woman who shares an uncanny physical resemblance to Mary.[10]

Plot
Main article: List of Silent Hill series characters
James arrives in Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his wife Mary, who died three years earlier from a degenerative disease. He meets Angela and dismisses her warning that the town is dangerous, but finds it inhabited by inhuman creatures, and himself stalked by an indestructible monster, Pyramid Head.

At Toluca Lake, where James believes Mary is waiting for him, he meets Maria, who resembles Mary, but has a more assertive and flirtatious personality. Maria helps James search for Mary, coming across Eddie and Laura in a cinema, but Laura runs away from James. Finding herself inexplicably worried about Laura's safety, Maria insists on following her to the hospital, but falls ill soon after arriving. James finds Laura, who tells him that she befriended Mary a year earlier while they were hospitalised, but she locks James in a room and runs away when he does not believe her. James and a recovered Maria are ambushed by Pyramid Head, who kills Maria; a despondent James escapes. He traverses a decrepit prison, where he rescues Angela from a monster representing her father, whom she killed after enduring years of his sexual abuse. Despite James's help, Angela accuses him of not wanting the ailing Mary around.

James enters a labyrinth where he finds Maria alive and unharmed behind impassable bars. She expresses disbelief at her apparent death and recounts Mary's memories, including James forgetting a videotape at the Lakeview Hotel during their last vacation. Maria encourages the confused James to find a way to free her, offering to be anything he wants her to be. On his return, however, he finds Maria dead, disfigured in the same way Mary was by the disease. After leaving the labyrinth, James confronts Eddie, who believes he has been killing people who mocked him. Eddie gleefully admits to maiming a bully and killing a dog before arriving in Silent Hill. Assuming James is also mocking him, Eddie attacks, forcing James to reluctantly kill him in self-defense.

At the hotel, Laura gives James a goodbye letter she received from Mary a week earlier, celebrating Laura's eighth birthday and expressing her desire for Laura to become her daughter. Realizing that Mary could not have died three years ago, James watches the videotape, which depicts their idyllic vacation before transitioning to James fatally smothering Mary. His memories restored, Mary's letter to James disappears, and he confesses the truth to Laura. James then encounters Angela, who thanks him for saving her but wishes he had not. Still unable to overcome her trauma, she asks James for a knife, but he refuses. Angela then ascends a burning staircase, resigned to her fate.

Afterward, James is confronted by two Pyramid Heads, who execute a revived Maria in front of him. James deduces that Pyramid Head was created as a result of his desire for punishment, but as he no longer needs them, the Pyramid Heads commit suicide. At the hotel's rooftop, he defeats a monstrous version of either Mary—who refuses to forgive him—or Maria—who refuses to let him abandon her.

The ending varies based on the player's actions: in "Leave", James tells Mary that he resented her for her illness and hostility toward him—fueled by her feelings of inadequacy and fear of her death—leading him to kill her to free them both. Sensing his regret, Mary forgives him, giving him her real final letter, in which she tells James that he made her happy and encourages him to live. He leaves the town with Laura; in "Maria", James chooses Maria over Mary and leaves with her. Maria coughs, implying she will become sick like Mary; "In Water" sees James, unable to live without Mary, commit suicide by driving into Toluca Lake; "Stillness" expands on this, showing Mary comforting James before his death; "Bliss" sees James seemingly enter the vacation videotape, choosing to remain ignorant of his actions; and in "Rebirth", James plans to resurrect Mary using the town's old gods. Two joke endings feature James discovering a Shiba Inu orchestrated the game's events ("Dog") or being abducted by aliens ("UFO").

Development
In June 2021, Polish developer Bloober Team announced that they had embarked on a "strategic co-operation agreement" with Konami that would involve "jointly developing selected contents and exchanging know-how" with the publisher. Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno commented on the deal, asserting that "The fact that such a renowned company as Konami has decided to strategically cooperate with the Bloober Team means that we [have] also joined the world leaders in gaming and become an equal partner for the leading players in this market".[12] Konami issued a separate statement, with the publisher remarking, "We don't have any specifics to share at this time, but we can say while Bloober Team will continue to produce their own original content, we're excited at the chance to collaborate with them on potential projects across our various IP".[13]

In September 2022, a series of leaks revealed purported images sourced from a planned remake of Silent Hill 2 to be developed by Bloober Team, adding to substantiated reports that Konami was supervising an initiative to revive the series by outsourcing future games to collaborative developers.[14][15] An internet leaker alleged that the images were taken from an internal test demo Bloober Team developed to pitch the project to Konami, and as a result did not represent the final title.[16] The leaked images were subsequently taken down by Konami representatives.[17] Another leak alluding to the game appeared the following month, through a YouTube description for a trailer accidentally made public by Konami themselves.[18]

In October 2022, the remake was officially announced by Konami during their Silent Hill Transmission presentation, alongside other games such as Silent Hill f, Silent Hill: Townfall, and Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as the film Return to Silent Hill.[19] It is the first game in an ongoing initiative by Konami to rejuvenate mainstream interest in the franchise, which had not seen a new major entry since the release of Silent Hill: Book of Memories (2012) and the subsequent cancellation of Silent Hills from former internal studio Kojima Productions.[20] It was confirmed at the presentation that creature designer Masahiro Ito and original composer Akira Yamaoka would return to contribute to the remake. It uses Unreal Engine 5.[21]

Bloober Team creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart cited the importance of "preserving the atmosphere that made Silent Hill 2 so exceptional, while modernizing many aspects of the game's overall gameplay" as a key factor in the decision to remake the game. Lenart additionally revealed that the original third-person combat system and certain story set pieces were completely rebuilt.[1][22] In an interview with Famitsu, producer Motoi Okamoto stated that Bloober Team and the staff from the original game had differing opinions on what aspects of the remake should be modernized, versus being preserved from the original. However, he noted that "thanks to the [opinions] of Bloober Team, who are big fans of the original, the remake ended up being highly respectful of the original game."[23]

Silent Hill 2 received "generally favorable" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[27][28] OpenCritic reported that 95% of critics recommended the game, with critics praising its faithfulness to the original, as well as its atmosphere, performances, sound design, and soundtrack.[29]

Critics praised Silent Hill 2's faithfulness to its source material. Giovanni Colantonio of Digital Trends deemed the game a "faithful tribute to a horror classic that hardly holds anything back" and lauded Bloober for not interfering with the original story.[40] Eurogamer's Vikki Blake noted its expansion and for giving "careful attention to what it preserves."[41] Jason Faulkner of Game Revolution, who gave Silent Hill 2 a perfect score in his review, wrote that it "sets a new golden standard when it comes to remakes", and noted how the story is "carried over completely intact, honoring the original narrative while adding depth where appropriate."[42]

Silent Hill 2's atmosphere and graphics were highlighted by critics. Ben Rayner of Digital Spy stated that the visuals "are impressive and really elevate the tension of exploring Silent Hill's abandoned buildings and streets—each feeling just off enough to ratchet that tension up as you dig deeper."[43] Tristan Ogilvie of IGN likened its environment to "a scab you can't stop picking."[44] Also praised was the overhaul of the soundtrack, which Mark Delaney of GameSpot called "incredible" and "unforgettable, even as it's often deliberately at odds with the events you're seeing on the screen."[45]

There was some criticism of Silent Hill 2's gameplay. Colantonio said it was "padded with backtracking" and the combat "gets old".[40] Delaney praised its melee combat, but criticized the abundance of ammo and health items provided for the player.[45] Leon Hurley of GamesRadar+ called it a "mix of clumsy pipe swinging and wobbly aiming [...] things can quickly go awry" but praised the ability to dodge.[46] TechRadar's Sarah Thwaites reacted more negatively, writing that "Clunky combat doesn’t work with a new camera angle, making for frustrating fights".[47] In a positive review, Liam Croft of Push Square believed it was one of the game's strengths and called it "weighty".[48] Kelsey Raynor of VG247 called it "good enough".[49]

Sales
The game sold over one million units within four days since release, making it the fastest-selling game in the series,[50] and over two million units as of January 2025.[51]

Awards
At the IGN Japan Awards on December 11-12, Silent Hill 2 was awarded Best Sound Design, Best Story, and Game of the Year.[52][53] On December 20, the IGN Awards recognized it as Best Horror Game and nominated it for Best Game and Best Playstation Game,[54] while the game won IGN Community Awards's Best Horror Game.[55] A week later, Shacknews named Silent Hill 2 the Best Horror Game at its annual online event.[56]

Silent Hill 2 (Bloober Team, 2024) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES
 1. Enriched Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - James = grieving everyman recast as an unwitting killer seeking absolution.
    - Maria = the archetypal “mysterious woman,” reframed as a sensual projection
      of James’s denial rather than a standard love interest.
    - Angela, Eddie, Laura = stock side characters reshaped into mirrors of
      trauma, paranoia, and innocence, each exposing a shard of James’s psyche.
 2. Internal Conflict and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - The entire quest is James’s battle with suppressed guilt; every monster and
      ending stems from how he confronts (or avoids) that truth.
 3. Evolving Romantic Subplots (Medium Risk)
    - James’s attraction to Maria blossoms from grief-soaked need, slowly
      curdling into horror when her resemblance to Mary forces him to face
      reality.
 4. Integrated Mentors and Allies (Medium Risk)
    - Angela, Eddie, and Laura drift in and out, not as plot devices but as
      living embodiments of abuse, bullying, and innocence that nudge James
      toward self-revelation.

II. NARRATIVE / THEME-AFFECTING TROPES
15. Inevitable Consequence Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - James’s mercy killing of Mary—and the letter its memory conjures—ignites a
      chain of punishments that could only end in confrontation or collapse.
16. Visual Stillness Before Chaos (Low Risk)
    - Silent Hill’s ghost-quiet streets and muffled fog precede every creature
      attack, weaponizing calm into dread.
18. Solitary Transformation Moment (Low Risk)
    - Alone in the Lakeview Hotel, James watches the forgotten videotape and
      finally accepts his crime—his defining pivot.
19. Symbolic Collapse of Hope (Low Risk)
    - Maria’s second, brutal corpse or the burning staircase where Angela fades
      away signals the nadir when denial dies.
20. Evocative Environmental Mood (Low Risk)
    - Rust, ash, and sirens reshape the town to mirror James’s mental decay,
      making atmosphere itself a storyteller.
21. Thematic Final Echo (Low Risk)
    - The cherished locket that opens the game is either released, clutched, or
      buried in each ending, echoing James’s chosen reckoning.
24. False Hope at Midpoint (Medium Risk)
    - Maria’s “miraculous” return and flirtatious optimism lure James (and the
      player) into believing redemption is easy—seconds before Pyramid Head’s
      next execution.
25. Character-Driven Chase Stakes (Medium Risk)
    - Every pursuit by Pyramid Head is less a monster chase than James’s guilt
      personified, escalating as his self-loathing grows.

The Last of Us Part I is a 2022 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. A remake of the 2013 game The Last of Us, it features revised gameplay, including enhanced combat and exploration, and expanded accessibility options. Players control Joel, who is tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States and defend her against cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game includes a remake of the 2014 expansion pack The Last of Us: Left Behind, which follows Ellie and her best friend Riley.

Development was led by game director Matthew Gallant and creative director Shaun Escayg, who replaced original directors Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann. Part I was rebuilt for the updated hardware, requiring new animations, art direction, and character models to align with the original development team's vision. The cutscenes and narrative beats were analyzed to identify crucial storylines and their original direction and purpose. The team built upon the game engine of The Last of Us Part II (2020) by expanding the gameplay, technology, and accessibility features. Part I features audio descriptions, supports 3D audio, and uses the DualSense controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

The Last of Us Part I was released for the PlayStation 5 in September 2022. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphical enhancements, facial animations, artificial intelligence, and its added accessibility, audio, and controller options. The response to its gameplay and level design was mixed, and several critics questioned the necessity of a remake, especially considering its price. It received an award at the Visual Effects Society Awards, and nominations at the Game Awards and Golden Joystick Awards. The Windows release in March 2023 was marred by performance problems and received mixed reviews. The game sold over two million units by March 2024.

The Last of Us Part I (right) is a remake of The Last of Us (left), featuring revised gameplay, updated character models, and improved lighting effects.[11][12]
The Last of Us Part I is a remake of the 2013 video game The Last of Us, an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective.[13] The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments to advance the story, and uses firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as the Infected, who have been infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.[14][15]

For most of the game, player character Joel escorts a young girl, Ellie, across the United States.[16] The player controls Ellie throughout the winter segment,[15] and briefly controls Joel's daughter Sarah in the opening sequence.[17] In the included expansion The Last of Us: Left Behind, the player controls Ellie as she spends time with her best friend and love interest Riley Abel.[14][18] The original game's online multiplayer mode is omitted from Part I,[19] and its narrative is entirely unchanged.[20]

The remake features revised gameplay, including enhanced combat and exploration.[11][12] The overhauled artificial intelligence (AI) allows more non-player characters (NPCs) on screen,[6] with enemy AI acting more aggressive and tactical than in the original game.[15] The Infected received gameplay adaptations, such as new Stalker animations and a charge move for Bloaters.[21] Gameplay additions include a permadeath mode, a speedrun-focused mode, and new costumes for Joel and Ellie.[22] The expanded accessibility options include customizable controls, a screen reader, audio prompts, audio description for cutscenes, and haptic feedback during dialogue;[23] difficulty modes can be customized to change enemy resilience, stealth efficacy, and resource availability.[20] The overhauled photo mode adds several features, allowing visual and gameplay modifiers such as slow motion and infinite ammunition.[20]

On PlayStation 5, the game supports hardware features such as 3D audio,[11][12] and uses the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller to emulate gameplay actions such as shooting a shotgun or drawing a bowstring.[24] It can display at native 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, or upscaled resolution at a targeted 60 frames per second; with variable refresh rate enabled, both modes allow an unlocked frame rate, capable of more than 60 frames per second.[25][26]

Gallant and Escayg led development of The Last of Us Part I as game director and creative director, replacing original directors Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, respectively.[6]
The Last of Us Part I was developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Development was led by game director Matthew Gallant and creative director Shaun Escayg, who replaced original directors Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, respectively.[6] Gallant previously worked as a combat designer on the original game and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016),[27][6] and became lead systems designer on The Last of Us Part II (2020), co-leading its accessibility features. Escayg was lead cinematic animator on The Last of Us[6]—his first game[28]—and creative director on Uncharted: The Lost Legacy (2017),[12] followed by his work as creative director and co-writer of Marvel's Avengers (2020) at Crystal Dynamics, before returning to Naughty Dog in April 2021.[29] Splitting their directing duties, Escayg took responsibility for the cinematics.[30] Gallant found he resonated with the themes much more closely than during the development of the original game, having become a father in the interim.[3] According to Escayg, the team approached the remake as "a love letter to our fans, to the franchise, and to ourselves as developers";[31] they felt a responsibility to preserve its essence and quality.[32]: 0:56  Several of the creative leadership team of Part I worked on the original game.[30]

Naughty Dog hoped the remake would allow Part I and Part II to be played sequentially with no technological or visual discrepancies. They felt new audiences, such as viewers of the television adaptation and new PlayStation 5 players, could be reached. The remake was partially inspired by Part II's flashback scenes, for which the team rebuilt areas and assets from the original game: Gallant said that several team members pondered if "the whole game looked as good as those flashback sequences, how exciting that would be".[28] Development began by transitioning the game to Part II's updated game engine.[28] The game was rebuilt to use the PlayStation 5 hardware, requiring new art direction, animation, and character models.[22] The technological and graphical enhancements were intended to align with the vision of the original game's team. Escayg wanted each element to make the player feel grounded and immersed in the world.[6] The team re-evaluated thousands of "micro decisions" during development, removing objects deemed unimportant or distracting and detailing or redesigning those that required improvements.[27] Areas were re-evaluated to determine if their designs were a result of the PlayStation 3's technical limitations; where appropriate, some areas were rebuilt or further detailed.[27]

The developers rationalized the rebuilt accessibility features as important to the remake.[28][31] They expanded the features from Part II—assisted by Part I being built in Part II's engine[31]—with three presets configuring settings recommended for players requiring hearing, motor, or visual aids.[23] During the development of The Last of Us Part II, blind accessibility consultant Brandon Cole noted that visually-impaired players missed environmental context and the unspoken interactions between characters, but the production timeline limited the team's ability to implement a solution. Gallant revisited the idea for Part I and collaborated with Descriptive Video Works to create audio descriptions for cutscenes. Writing and recording the audio descriptions caused difficulties, as they had to convey the information succinctly while maintaining the context and themes.[33] The customizable vibration options were inspired by a review of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (2022) from Can I Play That?, which criticized the lack of variability.[33] The team identified sequences that would present accessibility problems—such as the arcade sequence in Left Behind—and engaged several consultants for assistance, including Cole.[31]

The combat system—particularly melee—evolved using development tools from Part II.[6] The team felt the original game's combat sequences were iconic and required no significant overhaul;[27] they forwent the ability to go prone in gameplay—a feature added in Part II—as it would have "broken the gameplay and the combat space" since the original game was not built for it.[34] Part II's dodge mechanic was similarly omitted as it required reworking both enemy attacks and the gameplay space, and would diminish the claustrophobia and tension of the fights; Gallant noted "Joel fundamentally needs to feel different than playing as Ellie", Part II's playable protagonist.[27] PlayStation 3 hardware limitations forced the original team to "hack together" combat sequences, including some that are pre-scripted; advancements on the PlayStation 5 allowed the developers to create dynamic encounters, with AI directing the enemy NPCs to investigate and analyze with more accuracy.[6] The fundamental AI technology built upon Part II's.[32]: 12:45  While the original game was limited to eight NPCs during enemy encounters—forcing some to disregard the player in the presence of others—the PlayStation 5 allows up to 128 active NPCs focusing on the player.[6][35] In some instances, the original game could not have both male and female Infected fighting simultaneously, which was corrected in the remake.[36] Gallant found the new technology made gameplay sequences more unpredictable.[27]


Erick Pangilinan, co-art director on the original game, returned in the same role for The Last of Us Part I.[37]
The visual departments analyzed the original game to understand it better, focusing development resources on the most crucial scenes and storylines to maximize their impact. Rather than simply improving the visuals, the team analyzed its cutscenes and narrative beats, employing modernized techniques to emphasize story moments. Art director Erick Pangilinan[f] ensured that the team remembered the original direction and purpose behind each scene; in some instances during development, they lost track of the original purpose, which would impact other scenes later on.[37] The original game's vision was to emphasize the world's beauty, as opposed to a visually dark and dystopian image; art director Sebastian Gromann felt that PlayStation 5 allowed a truer realization of this vision, particularly due to the more complex models and shaders allowing increased fidelity and volume of foliage. Characters and environments benefited from an increased polygon count.[6] The original motion capture data was used for the cinematics, with the facial animation overhauled to more closely resemble the original performances.[32]: 4:43  The remake was considered a good opportunity to expand some environments, such as adding detail and items to the back offices of the Boston museum, and visually shifting the university section for a more claustrophobic feeling.[36] The team forced themselves to pull back on some additions as they failed to heighten the experience or fit within the narrative context; trees and overgrowth were initially added to the military city, but removed when the team realized it would be unrealistic in the setting.[21]

The addition of a speedrunning mode was suggested by one of the team members interested in the field, and the developers consulted with professional speedrunners. Gallant felt the permadeath mode raised the stakes of the original game's already-tense combat.[21] The developers used the PlayStation 5's Tempest Engine—an evolution of technology from the PlayStation 4—to render the 3D audio, including during quieter moments of dialogue.[6] Audio programmers spent over a year reworking Naughty Dog's audio engine, as it was incompatible with the Tempest Engine's features. The audio mixing and mastering processes were overhauled for increased clarity and fidelity. The team reused much of the sound from the original game as they considered it iconic; some of the re-recorded audio included the workbench upgrades, as well as murmuration for the Infected, introduced in Part II. The actors' original performances were maintained.[37]

Release
The existence of a remake of The Last of Us was first reported in April 2021 by Bloomberg News's Jason Schreier. The report claimed the game, codenamed "T1X",[g] had started at Sony's Visual Arts Support Group studio but was later moved under Naughty Dog's budget after some staff joined the project in 2020.[39] A PlayStation Store listing with a trailer and information about the game was prematurely released on June 9, 2022.[40] The game was announced for PlayStation 5 and Windows later that day at Summer Game Fest.[11][12] Reactions to the announcement were mixed, as some journalists and players considered another release following The Last of Us Remastered superfluous[41][42] and questioned the US$70 price point.[43][44][45]

Naughty Dog announced special edition versions granting in-game upgrades and skills; the physical special edition includes a SteelBook case and comic series The Last of Us: American Dreams (2013) with new cover art.[46] All key art and covers were designed by David Blatt, known as Kopfstoff, who was contracted after becoming known for his fan art of the games.[1] The United States-exclusive Firefly Edition for PlayStation 5 sold out within an hour of its announcement;[47] it received a restock at release, which sold out within seconds.[48] Several players reported receiving damaged versions of the Firefly Edition due to poor packaging; Sony offered store discounts or refunds in some instances, but did not provide replacements.[47][49] For the Windows release, the Firefly Edition was available in the United States and some European countries, containing a digital version of the game for Steam.[50]

Development—which did not involve any crunch, unlike several of Naughty Dog's previous games[51]—ceased by July 11, 2022, as the game was submitted for manufacturing.[52] The final pre-launch trailer was released on August 24,[53] and the game was released for PlayStation 5 on September 2.[11][12] A two-hour trial was released for PlayStation Plus Premium members on January 15, 2023, coinciding with the television adaptation's premiere.[54] The Windows version, co-developed by Iron Galaxy,[2] was announced with a trailer at the Game Awards in December 2022;[55] it missed its original release date of March 3, delayed in February to March 28.[56] The PlayStation 5 version was updated in October 2024 to target higher resolutions and frame rates on the PlayStation 5 Pro.[57] The Last of Us Complete—a bundle featuring Part I and Part II Remastered—was released digitally on April 10, 2025, set to be followed by a physical collector's edition on July 10, featuring a SteelBook case, art prints, and American Dreams.[58]

The Last of Us Part I received "generally favorable" reviews from critics for the PlayStation 5 version, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[59] It was praised for its graphical enhancements,[60][64][68] updated facial animations,[62][67][69] improved enemy and character AI,[13][61][70] and its added accessibility, audio, and controller options,[13][62][63] though the response to its gameplay and level design was mixed.[13][60][64] Many reviewers considered it the definitive version of the game;[60][64][71] VG247's Tom Orry named it "one of the best remakes I've ever played".[66] Several reviewers questioned the necessity of the game,[16][72] especially considering its price and the existence of The Last of Us Remastered;[14][61] conversely, some critics compared it to a film remaster on an Ultra HD Blu-ray, seen as an acceptable practice in its industry.[67][70] The omission of the multiplayer mode was lamented by critics.[13][14][62] GameRevolution's Jason Faulkner found the absence of story additions to be "some huge missed opportunities",[61] and Game Informer's Blake Hester felt the lack of narrative changes exacerbated the outdated presentation of its themes.[15]

IGN's Luke Reilly considered the game an effective graphical showcase for the PlayStation 5.[64] Michael Goroff of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) wrote that while the original game captured how players visualized a post-apocalyptic world, the remake's art style and graphics are more akin to how Joel or Ellie saw the world: "overgrown and dingy ... but it can also be beautiful or even mundane".[60] The Verge's Andrew Webster compared the improved graphics to modern blockbusters,[73] and Siliconera's Josh Tolentino wrote that it matched his memory of the original.[68] Ars Technica's Sam Machkovech praised the visual improvements but felt that the original did not require a full overhaul like Demon's Souls (2020),[69] while Shacknews's TJ Denzer criticized the fuzzier visuals of Listen Mode.[17] Critics praised the improved lighting system and minimalized user interface;[64][65][66] The Telegraph's Dan Silver considered the former award-worthy,[72] and EGM's Goroff felt the game never lost its narrative tone despite more realistic lighting.[60]

Several reviewers considered the improved character models Part I's strongest feature.[62][65][67]
Several reviewers considered the improved character models and facial animation the remake's greatest feature.[62][65][67] EGM's Goroff and IGN's Reilly found they made the acting more effective, with new microexpressions adding depth to each character,[60][64] which Ars Technica's Machkovech compared to awarded film performances.[69] Game Informer's Hester similarly observed the performances as more accurate and emotive without the original's awkwardness,[15] and Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler found the remake captured the intention of story and character moments where the original technologically could not.[67] Alex Avard of GamesRadar+ felt that even briefly-seen NPCs looked better than Joel and Ellie did in the original,[63] and Denzer of Shacknews said that the characters "look far less doll-like and emote far better".[17]

Critics praised improvements to enemy and companion AI.[13][61][70] Ars Technica's Machkovech compared the combat sequences to the original game's scripted reveal trailer,[69] and GameSpot's Jake Dekker found the improvements led to more tense and difficult encounters.[62] Hardcore Gamer's Kevin Dunsmore echoed this sentiment but noted some "wonkiness remains" from the original, with companions failing to follow correct paths.[14] IGN's Reilly lamented the omission of Part II's pre-scripted enemy names but otherwise praised the improvements to enemy AI.[64] Siliconera's Tolentino found the changes superficial due to the identical map layouts and encounter designs,[68] while EGM's Goroff felt the behavior remained simplistic, with enemies hasty to approach their fallen allies.[60]

GameSpot's Dekker found the gameplay improved in line with the story, with more responsive aiming, heavier weapons, and easier movements.[62] The Telegraph's Silver found the updated controls made combat smoother,[72] while VG247's Orry said they retained "a slight clunkiness" but ultimately led to more tense gameplay encounters.[66] Gene Park of The Washington Post lauded the realistic gun controls and called Joel's movement "appropriately heavy";[70] likewise, Reilly of IGN noted that Joel and Ellie felt weightier and more realistic but lamented the lack of Part II's dodge mechanic.[64] Other reviewers similarly felt that combat and level design failed to compare to Part II's, though recognized the former as a vast improvement of the original.[13][60][67] GamesRadar+'s Avard found the combat changes minimal,[63] while Ars Technica's Machkovech felt the gameplay "still feels like a PlayStation 3 game" at worst.[69] The A.V. Club's William Hughes enjoyed the combat but found it could occasionally "tip over from 'exhilarating' to 'frustrating'".[16]

Reviewers praised the new options and features.[60][64] GameSpot's Dekker wrote that The Last of Us Part I "sets a new standard for accessibility in games".[62] Siliconera's Tolentino called it one of the most accessible games,[68] and Ars Technica's Machkovech found its options more robust than any other.[69] The A.V. Club's Hughes considered the accessibility options the only worthy addition,[16] and Shacknews's Denzer highlighted the cutscene audio descriptions as a standout option.[17] Ben Bayliss of Can I Play That? lauded the range of features for demonstrating "what is possible when a remake is done well", though noted some mobility problems and criticized the complexity required to balance different options.[74] Critics lauded the use of the DualSense's haptic feedback,[61][63] considered among the best uses to date alongside Astro's Playroom (2020).[13][64] VideoGamer.com's Josh Wise felt the controller "added crunch to the combat"[65] and The Verge's Webster lauded its use of the bow.[73] Avard of GamesRadar+ found that 3D audio made the Infected more terrifying;[63] the tension and horror led The Verge's Webster to play without headphones[73] and VG247's Orry to mute the sound,[66] while Push Square's Barker noted its effectiveness led to limited usage of Listen Mode.[13]

The Windows version received "mixed or average" reviews according to Metacritic;[59] it is Naughty Dog's lowest-rated game.[84][85] Reviewers were not provided with advance copies until minutes before the game's public release.[75][86][87] Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter described the game as "effectively a beta", citing poor optimization and intense system requirements;[88] MeriStation's Salva Fernandez felt it was not ready for release in its published state,[76] and Gamereactor's Petter Hegevall named it "the worst optimized PC conversion" since 2021's Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.[89] PC Gamer's Phil Iwaniuk lamented scoring the game poorly but considered it necessary as the problems were "a real barrier" preventing the experience.[77]

Several reviewers praised the remake's technical and visual improvements, but criticized its optimization, system requirements, and performance problems;[78][81][83] GamingBolt's Shunal Doke called it "unplayable",[81] and some critics recommended waiting to play until after performance problems were addressed.[62][78] Conversely, The Games Machine's Emanuel Feronato noted a lack of performance problems even on higher settings.[79] GameSpot's Alessandro Barbosa praised the extensive settings options,[62] though Inverse's Grant Stoner found the limited key bindings customization disappointing due to Naughty Dog's focus on accessibility.[82] CD-Action's Paweł Raban criticized the default keyboard controls, opting for a controller.[80]

The port was poorly received by players, with a "mostly negative" rating on Steam based on over 9,000 reviews.[86][90] Reviews cited performance problems such as inconsistent frame rates, poor optimization, and frequent crashes,[90][91][92] with some reporting the game took hours to compile shaders[86][93][94] and sharing glitches like broken character models, vibrant colors, and characters dripping with water.[95][96][97] Conversely, some users noted they had not encountered problems, even on lower-end computers.[98][99] Naughty Dog said it would investigate complaints and address problems through updates,[86][100] focusing on shader loading times, instability and graphical problems, and crashing caused by potential memory leaks.[101] Engadget's Nathan Ingraham wrote performance had improved on the Steam Deck after the first update,[102] though some reviewers and players felt problems persisted;[77][103] Valve listed the game as "unsupported" in early April.[104] Within days, Steam reviews improved to "mixed".[105][106] Reviewers concurred performance had improved after several weeks but some problems remained.[107][108] The game was "verified" on Steam Deck in June.[109]

The Last of Us Part I (Naughty Dog, 2022) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES
 1. Enriched Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Joel = the grizzled smuggler recast as a reluctant father-figure.
    - Ellie = the “snarky teen sidekick” reframed as witty, immune, and pivotal.
    - Tess, Bill, Tommy, and Marlene each expand a stock role (partner, loner,
      brother, leader) with lived-in motives and regrets.
 2. Internal Conflict and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Joel’s arc pivots on grief over Sarah’s death and his uneasy path toward
      loving Ellie, culminating in a morally fraught rescue.
 3. Evolving Romantic Subplots (Medium Risk)
    - Left Behind deepens Ellie’s bond with Riley from playful best-friend energy
      to tender first love, making their kiss tragic instead of gratuitous.
 4. Integrated Mentors and Allies (Medium Risk)
    - Supporting figures (Tess guiding the early trek, Tommy offering refuge,
      David’s twisted “hospitality”) all steer Joel or Ellie’s growth rather
      than appearing for mere exposition.

II. NARRATIVE / THEME-AFFECTING TROPES
15. Inevitable Consequence Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - A 20-year-old fungal outbreak born of scientific hubris dooms society and
      forces every later choice about trust, survival, and sacrifice.
16. Visual Stillness Before Chaos (Low Risk)
    - Quiet, haunting vistas of ruined America consistently precede clicker
      ambushes or human showdowns, letting dread bloom before violence.
18. Solitary Transformation Moment (Low Risk)
    - During winter, Ellie alone in the snow-covered lodge defeats David, the
      instant she shifts from protected child to self-reliant survivor.
19. Symbolic Collapse of Hope (Low Risk)
    - Henry’s suicide after Sam’s infection shatters the traveling family,
      visually marking Joel’s fear of losing Ellie next.
20. Evocative Environmental Mood (Low Risk)
    - Flooded subways, sun-drenched Colorado autumn, and salt-lake sterility all
      echo the pair’s shifting emotional states.
21. Thematic Final Echo (Low Risk)
    - A closing shot of Ellie’s questioning gaze mirrors her first naïve
      curiosity, now weighted by Joel’s lie.

The Last of Us Part II is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Set four years after The Last of Us (2013), the game focuses on two playable characters in a post-apocalyptic United States whose lives intertwine: Ellie, who sets out in revenge for a murder, and Abby, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. The game uses a third-person perspective; the player must fight human enemies and zombie-like creatures with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth.

The game's development began in 2014, after the release of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director, co-writing the story with Halley Gross. The themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel. Ashley Johnson reprises her role as Ellie, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby. Their performances included the simultaneous recording of motion and voice. Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the score. The developers pushed the PlayStation 4's technical capabilities. Development reportedly included a crunch schedule of 12-hour workdays and cost around US$220 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop.

Following some delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Last of Us Part II was released for the PlayStation 4 in June 2020. A remastered version was released for the PlayStation 5 in January 2024 and for Windows in April 2025. Part II received acclaim for its gameplay, audio design, score, performances, characters, and visual fidelity, though its narrative and themes divided critics. Discourse became adversarial and the game was review bombed on Metacritic, with some players criticizing the story and characters. Part II is one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games and the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, with over four million units sold in its release weekend and over ten million by 2022. It won more than 320 Game of the Year awards and received multiple other accolades from awards shows and gaming publications.

Gameplay
The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective featuring elements of the survival horror genre.[2][3] The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.[4] Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby;[2] the player also briefly controls Joel in the opening sequence.[5] The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.[6] The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain supplies.[7] Some areas are navigated by horse or boat.[4][8]

The player character is lying on her stomach. Some human enemies and a dog lurk in the distance.
In a change from its predecessor, The Last of Us Part II allows the player to crawl in a prone position to evade enemies.[9]
In combat, the player can use long-range weapons such as rifles and bows,[4][10] and short-range weapons such as pistols and revolvers.[6] The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons such as machetes and hammers,[11] and throw bricks and bottles to distract or attack enemies.[12] Collected items can be used to upgrade weapons at workbenches[13] or craft equipment such as health kits, Molotov cocktails, and makeshift silencers.[2] The player can collect supplements to upgrade skills in a skill tree; training manuals found throughout the environment unlock additional skill tree branches, allowing upgrades to attributes such as the health meter, crafting speed, and ammunition types.[14]

Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak past them.[2] "Listen Mode" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.[12] In the cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain advantages in combat, and can also crawl in a prone position to evade enemies.[9] Hostile enemies use artificial intelligence; they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage when the player is distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight.[15] The player may be impaled by an arrow, which will progressively decrease their health meter and disables Listen Mode until removed when in cover.[16] Player companions, such as Dina, assist in combat by killing enemies or announcing their location.[17] The game introduces guard dogs that track the player's scent, which can be visualized in Listen Mode.[2]

Plot

Joel (Troy Baker) confesses to his brother, Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), his responsibility in preventing the Fireflies attempting to develop a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving Ellie (Ashley Johnson) from a non-survivable surgical procedure. Four years later, Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming, though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger, Abby (Laura Bailey), from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost used as a temporary hideout by Abby's group, former Fireflies now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington. The group attack Joel and Tommy; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her father, the Firefly surgeon (Derek Phillips) who was to perform the operation on Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie and her girlfriend, Dina (Shannon Woodward), search for the brothers. Ellie enters the WLF outpost and witnesses Abby beat Joel to death. Abby spares Ellie and Tommy, who swear revenge.

Tommy sets out for Seattle to hunt Abby, and Ellie and Dina follow him. In Seattle, Ellie reveals her immunity to Dina, who in turn reveals she is pregnant. The next day, Ellie pursues Tommy alone and encounters Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina's ex-boyfriend, who followed them. While searching for Abby's friend Nora (Chelsea Tavares), Ellie encounters the Seraphites, a religious cult locked in a battle with the WLF over control of Seattle. Ellie tracks down Nora and tortures her for information on Abby's location, which traumatizes Ellie. The following day, she kills two more members of Abby's group, the pregnant Mel (Ashly Burch) and her boyfriend, Owen (Patrick Fugit). A flashback reveals that, two years earlier, Ellie traveled to the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City and learned the truth. Devastated, she cut ties with Joel. In the present, Ellie's group is ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and holds Tommy hostage.

Three days earlier, Abby learns that Owen, her ex-boyfriend, has gone missing while investigating Seraphite activity. Abby searches for Owen and is captured by Seraphites. She is rescued by Yara (Victoria Grace) and Lev (Ian Alexander), Seraphite siblings who have been branded apostates after Lev defied Seraphite traditions. Though Yara suffers a broken arm, Abby leaves them to find Owen who, disillusioned with the war, plans to sail to Santa Barbara, California, where Fireflies may be regrouping. Abby returns to rescue Yara and Lev, and travels across Seattle with Lev to retrieve medical supplies so Mel can amputate Yara's arm. After the surgery, Lev runs away to convince his devout mother to leave the Seraphite cult. Abby and Yara find him in the Seraphite settlement, where Lev has accidentally killed his mother in self-defense. The trio flee as the WLF begins an assault on the Seraphites. Abby betrays the WLF to save Lev, and Yara sacrifices herself to allow Abby and Lev to escape. The pair return to find Owen and Mel dead and a map leading to Ellie's hideout. An enraged Abby shoots Tommy, impairing him, and severely beats Ellie and Dina. At Lev's insistence, Abby spares them and tells them to leave Seattle.

Several months later,[18] Ellie and Dina are living on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse's son, though Ellie suffers from post-traumatic stress. When Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts, Ellie leaves to find her, despite Dina's pleas to stay. Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching for the Fireflies, who they discover are regrouping at Catalina Island, California, but are captured, tortured, and left to die by the slave-keeping Rattlers. Ellie arrives at Santa Barbara and rescues the pair. Ellie forces Abby to fight her, during which Abby bites off two of Ellie's fingers. Ellie overpowers and nearly drowns Abby, but has a change of heart after having a flashback of Joel, and ultimately spares her. Abby and Lev sail to the Fireflies. Ellie returns to the farmhouse and finds it empty. She tries to play Joel's guitar with her damaged hand, recalls her last conversation with Joel in which she expressed her willingness to forgive him, and leaves.[19]

Druckmann returned as creative director for The Last of Us Part II, co-writing the story with Gross, while Newman and Margenau were co-game directors.[20][21]
Early story concepts for The Last of Us Part II were conceived during the development of The Last of Us in 2013.[22][23] Naughty Dog began development in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered.[24] By August 2017, with the release of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the entire 350-person team at Naughty Dog had shifted to develop Part II.[25][21] Neil Druckmann led development as creative director and writer, reprising his role from The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016).[26][27] Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors for Part II,[20] overseeing gameplay elements such as level design and mechanics.[28] For the final months of development, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team operated via remote work arrangements.[21] In total, approximately 2,169 developers across 14 studios worked on the game.[29] According to documents from publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment, the 70-month development peaked at 200 full-time employees and cost around US$220 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop.[30]

Druckmann wrote the story with Halley Gross.[21] The team experimented with different plot structures and considered scrapping the project until they settled on an idea that mirrored the first game;[31] Druckmann said that whereas The Last of Us is about the extreme measures one would take for love, Part II is more about how far one would go to bring justice for those they love.[32] The themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel, where violence was a frequent topic.[21] He recalled watching footage of the 2000 Ramallah lynching, and how, after hearing the cheering crowds, his mind turned to violent thoughts about bringing the perpetrators to justice.[33][34] He wanted the player to feel a "thirst for revenge" before making them realize the reality of their actions.[21] Druckmann said other themes include tribalism, trauma, and the pursuit of justice.[32] Artists at Naughty Dog traveled to Seattle to analyze the architecture, vegetation, materials, topography, lighting, and capture photorealistic textures.[31][35]

Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Ellie and Joel, respectively, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby.[36][37] The actors' performances were recorded at a studio in Playa Vista, Los Angeles using performance capture, recording motion and voice simultaneously.[38] Gross noted that a goal of the writers was to "create the most multifaceted characters you've seen in games".[35] She particularly wanted to explore the multifaceted behavior of Ellie, showing her power as well as her insecurities.[39] The change of player character from Ellie to Abby was inspired by the change from Joel to Ellie in the first game, though emphasized in Part II due to its focus on empathy.[40] Druckmann wanted the player to hate Abby early in the game, but later empathize with her.[41]

The developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 when creating Part II, adding more enemies and larger environments than in previous games.[23] Druckmann noted that any drops in detail would ruin the sense of authenticity, which required consistent optimization of the technology.[31] Improved artificial intelligence (AI) allowed for deeper connections with characters and the creation of bonds through gameplay.[42] The Last of Us Part II was originally planned as an open world game with hub worlds, but later the game transferred to a more linear style as it better served the narrative.[43] Naughty Dog wanted to increase the accessibility options introduced in Uncharted 4 to ensure that all players could complete the story, and the developers attended conferences and worked with advocates.[44]

Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the game's score, as he had done with the first game,[45] while Mac Quayle contributed combat music.[21] The developers received permission to use the songs "Future Days" by Pearl Jam and "Take On Me" by A-ha.[46] To achieve the sound of the Shamblers, the team hired voice actors Raul Ceballos and Steve Blum, and used items such as grapefruits to create the explosion sounds. The dialogue team referenced whistled languages such as Sfryria and Silbo Gomero for the Seraphites' whistling, and hired actors Stevie Mack and Lisa Marie to provide the whistles in three styles.[47]

According to a report by Kotaku's Jason Schreier, the development included a crunch schedule of 12-hour work days. This continued after the game was delayed. Schreier suggested that development was slowed due to the enormous turnover of employees following the development of Uncharted 4, with few veterans left on the team. Some of the developers allegedly hoped that Part II would fail and prove that the working conditions were not viable. Sony granted Naughty Dog an additional two weeks of development for bug fixes.[48] Druckmann felt that he had failed to find the correct balance for employees on Part II, and said the studio would receive external assistance for future projects.[49]

Release and promotion

The Last of Us Part II was announced at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016.[36] At E3 2018, Druckmann said that Naughty Dog was refusing to announce a release date until the game was "very close to release", to avoid disappointing fans.[50] During Sony's State of Play presentation on September 24, 2019, Naughty Dog announced a release date of February 21, 2020.[51] On October 25, Druckmann announced a delay to May 29, 2020, to "bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality".[52] On April 2, 2020, Sony announced that the game was almost complete but had been indefinitely delayed due to logistical problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[53] In late April, several videos leaked online, showing cutscenes, gameplay, and significant plot details. Druckmann tweeted that he was "heartbroken" for fans and for the team, who had devoted years to development.[54] On April 27, Sony announced a release date of June 19, 2020.[55]

The first trailer was released alongside the announcement, showcasing the return of Ellie and Joel.[56] The second trailer, released in October 2017 as a part of Paris Games Week, revealed Abby, Yara, and Lev.[57][58] Dina and Jesse were first shown in a presentation at E3 2018.[59] A trailer was featured in Sony's State of Play presentation in September 2019,[60] which preceded additional marketing to celebrate Outbreak Week—the week in which the fictional outbreak occurred in the original game.[61] A story trailer was released on May 6,[62] followed by an animated commercial on June 3,[63] and the final pre-launch trailer on June 10.[64] Naughty Dog replaced and altered characters in the trailers to conceal story events; Druckmann cited the marketing of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), which concealed its protagonist in trailers, as an influence.[65]

Naughty Dog announced the special edition versions in September 2019.[66] The game was featured in its own standalone State of Play presentation on May 27.[67] From May 13 to June 3, Naughty Dog released a series of videos about the development.[68] The game was banned in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, attributed to the countries' conservative traditions regarding homosexuality.[69] An update on August 13 added a permadeath mode, a new difficulty level, and gameplay modifiers.[70] For The Last of Us Day[b] in September 2020, Naughty Dog announced new merchandise for the game, including a vinyl soundtrack, board game, statues, and posters.[72] A performance update was released on May 19, 2021, allowing gameplay at 60 frames per second on the PlayStation 5.[73] A 120-minute documentary about the game's development, Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II, was released on February 2, 2024.[74]

Remaster
In November 2023, following a PlayStation Store listing leak, Naughty Dog announced a remastered version of the game, titled The Last of Us Part II Remastered. It was released for the PlayStation 5 on January 19, 2024; existing owners can purchase the game digitally for US$10. A special edition version, including a SteelBook case, trading cards, patch, and pins, was made available in some regions.[75] Remastered features visual improvements, faster loading times, DualSense integration, audio description, a speedrun-focused mode, and an audio commentary for cutscenes featuring Druckmann, Gross, Johnson, Baker, Bailey, and Woodward.[75][76] Some journalists and players questioned whether the game needed a remaster within four years of its initial release, though others felt it was justified by the additions and price point.[77][78][79]

New gameplay modes include Guitar Free Play, featuring playable characters Ellie, Joel, and Gustavo (modeled after Santaolalla) in several locations with unlockable guitars like Gustavo's banjo;[80] Lost Levels, featuring three scrapped and incomplete gameplay sequences with an introduction by Druckmann and commentary by designers Pete Ellis and Banun Idris;[81] and No Return, a roguelike survival mode featuring randomized combat encounters.[75] No Return features ten playable characters[c] with unique traits and tracked challenges, which can be completed to unlock skins and gameplay modifications.[82] Each run in No Return features five encounters and a boss fight.[84] Encounters consist of four gameplay types, including fighting waves of enemies, capturing a guarded safe, and defending a friend. Upgrades, items, and weapons collected during runs are lost upon completion or failure.[82] Remastered was updated in October 2024 to target higher resolutions and frame rates on the PlayStation 5 Pro.[85]

At the Game Awards in December 2024, Naughty Dog announced the game's Windows version, developed in collaboration with Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy;[1] new content[d] was added to the PlayStation 5 version in tandem with the Windows release on April 3, 2025.[83] The Last of Us Complete—a bundle featuring The Last of Us Part I and Part II Remastered—was released digitally on April 10, 2025, set to be followed by a physical collector's edition on July 10, featuring a SteelBook case, art prints, and a new print of the comic series The Last of Us: American Dreams.[86]

The Last of Us Part II received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[87] OpenCritic's consensus called it "another masterpiece from Naughty Dog" and "a brutal, poignant, beautiful, and thrilling experience", with 95% of critics recommending the game.[88] IGN's Jonathon Dornbush called it "a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor", noting, atop its improved gameplay, it "still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit".[6] Game Informer's Andy McNamara called it "the best narrative game I have played" and "a sequel unlike any other, taking video game storytelling to new heights".[90] Kaity Kline of NPR wrote that it "made me very aware of the little things in my life that I take for granted, the kinds of things you don't appreciate until they're ripped away forever".[93] GameSpot's Kallie Plagge called it "beautiful and devastating", and wrote "the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core".[2]

Game Informer's McNamara felt that the writers conveyed the themes of emotions "with careful nuance and unflinching emotion".[90] Destructoid's Chris Carter and VG247's Kirk McKeand applauded the use of minor dialogue to echo the themes.[8][89] Sammy Barker of Push Square particularly praised the use of flashback and overlapping stories;[92] The Guardian's Keza MacDonald concurred, describing the narrative as "emotionally effective".[94] Conversely, GameRevolution's Michael Leri thought that the flashbacks were evidence of pacing problems.[91] Alex Avard of GamesRadar+ felt that the narrative lost its momentum during its need to finalize every story thread.[3] USgamer's Kat Bailey found the latter half slow, and that the game was five hours "too long".[10] Bailey also criticized the dissonance between the statement against violence and its necessity during gameplay.[10] Polygon's Maddy Myers and Kotaku's Riley MacLeod wrote that the game repeatedly delivered its themes without allowing the player any agency in their decisions.[4][9] Rob Zacny of Vice wrote that, despite the amount of narrative moments, "it doesn't have much to say".[95] Also writing for Vice, Emanuel Maiberg drew parallels between the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the WLF and Seraphites, and argued this was poorly considered for its allegorical representation of two equal sides.[96]

McKeand of VG247 described every character as "complex and human".[8] Destructoid's Carter felt empathetic to the main characters,[89] a sentiment echoed by IGN's Dornbush, who found Ellie's development particularly "riveting".[6] Andrew Webster of The Verge praised the relationship between Ellie and Dina, though noted some dissonance in Ellie's behavior between gameplay and cutscenes.[97] GameSpot's Plagge wrote that Abby's characterization led to a deeper connection to her than to Ellie, but found her character development incongruous with her "onslaught of combat against human enemies".[2] Kotaku's MacLeod and VentureBeat's Dean Takahashi appreciated the diversity of characters;[9][98] Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the representation of female and LGBT characters, calling it "a game about women".[99] NPR's Kline lauded the game's ability to "connect with every character, not just the main characters".[93] Push Square's Barker wrote that the supporting characters "establish themselves extremely swiftly",[92] and Game Informer's McNamara found their occasional absence alarming, having grown close to them.[90] Conversely, some critics felt that the new supporting characters lacked the higher quality of the main characters and of Naughty Dog's previous work;[10][91] Yannick Le Fur of Jeuxvideo.com wrote that characters such as Jesse and Manny were simply used to advance the narrative.[100] Polygon's Myers and Vice's Zacny criticized the characters' inability to learn from their mistakes.[4][95]

The performances of (L to R) Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey were widely praised by critics.[8][89][92][94]
Critics praised the cast's performances, particularly those of Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey.[8][89][92][94] Welsh of Eurogamer found Johnson's performance as Ellie to be "standout" due to her depiction of "rawness, vulnerability, and rage".[99] GamesRadar+'s Avard considered Johnson's portrayal of suffering "nothing short of awards worthy", and found that Baker "steals some of Part 2's best scenes as Joel" by adding complexities that enrich the character and relationships.[3] Dornbush of IGN wrote that Johnson added nuance to every element of Ellie, and commended Woodward's performance as Dina, especially during quieter moments.[6] VG247's McKeand found that the performances made the narrative more powerful.[8]

Avard of GamesRadar+ felt that the new gameplay mechanics were added with a level of care to ensure an authenticity that Naughty Dog is known for.[3] GameRevolution's Leri lauded the cohesiveness between gameplay and narrative, and the former's ability to create empathy.[91] Plagge of GameSpot appreciated the intensity of combat and wrote that "Ellie's movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted".[2] VentureBeat's Takahashi found the combat more diverse than its predecessor's.[15] IGN's Dornbush similarly felt that the combat gameplay and puzzle elements had been improved, praising the intelligence and variation of enemies.[6] Avard of GamesRadar+ described the enemy AI as "some of the most advanced" of any game.[3] McKeand of VG247 considered the level design better than other Naughty Dog games,[8] and McNamara of Game Informer felt that it improved combat scenarios.[90] The Verge's Webster admired the action but noted some "awkward moments when [it] attempts to cover its video game-ness".[97] Polygon's Myers found the combat an unsubtle messenger for its statement on violence;[4] Kotaku's MacLeod wrote that the "pace of the combat sometimes felt like punishment".[9]

Many critics felt the graphics were among the best of any PlayStation 4 game.[3][6][90][91] Kotaku's MacLeod wrote that the nature in Seattle is "gorgeous and awe-inspiring",[9] and Push Square's Barker declared the art department "among the best in the industry".[92] The Guardian's MacDonald described the graphics as "meticulous and astounding".[94] Dornbush of IGN appreciated the world's ability to tell additional stories.[6] GameRevolution's Leri considered the environments more realistic than the first game's, and praised the technical elements, such as frame rate, lack of load times, and realistic lighting.[91] Carter of Destructoid felt that the seamless animation of minor facial expressions humanized the characters to a new level.[89] McNamara of Game Informer similarly lauded the realistic-looking characters.[90] VentureBeat's Takahashi commended the improvements to Naughty Dog's already impressive engine.[15] Zacny of Vice found Seattle too similar to Boston and Pittsburgh from the first game,[95] and Christopher Byrd of The Washington Post wondered if the detail was worth the "human cost" of Naughty Dog's crunch culture.[101]

Barker of Push Square described the sound design as "stunning", identifying the 3D audio as a technical feat he would not have expected until PlayStation 5.[92] Vice's Zacny found that the audio design made settings feel more lifelike in a way that the visuals occasionally failed to do.[95] IGN's Dornbush similarly felt that the sounds added realism, and praised Santaolalla's "moving" score.[6] McNamara of Game Informer found that the music added tension.[90] Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer wrote that the "haunting and subtle melodies blend into the world seamlessly".[102] Eurogamer's Welsh praised the score for its combination of banjo and electronics.[99]

The Last of Us Part II Remastered received "universal acclaim" according to Metacritic,[103] and 90% of critics recommended the game according to OpenCritic.[104] Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler called it "the best way to play one of the best games ever made",[111] and Siliconera's Cory Dinkel wrote "it elevates an already near-perfect experience".[112] Push Square's Aaron Bayne found it perfectly partnered the first game's remake, Part I.[110] Digital Trends's Giovanni Colantonio compared it to a Criterion Collection re-release[113] and The Guardian's Keith Stuart compared replaying the game to "rereading a favourite novel".[114] Critics gave the Windows version "generally favorable" reviews,[103] praising the optimization though noting occasional performance issues.[107][109][115][116]

Destructoid's Smangaliso Simelane wrote that few console games look as "beautifully detailed and borderline photorealistic" as Remastered ;[117] Siliconera's Dinkel compared the cinematography to the work of Roger Deakins and felt the improved character animations enhanced the story,[112] and Variety's Katcy Stephan praised the visual and performance improvements for strengthening the narrative immersion.[118] Some reviewers found the visual changes negligible but unnecessary due to the original's quality.[108][119][120] The use of the DualSense's haptic technology was considered by Video Games Chronicle's Middler the best since Astro's Playroom (2020)[111] and by Siliconera's Dinkel the best of any game to date,[112] while Inverse's Kazuma Hashimoto found it strenuous after extended use.[119]

GamingBolt's Shubhankar Parijat considered No Return Remastered's standout feature.[121] Several reviewers found the mode addictive and felt it added value and replayability,[105][112][118] demonstrating the quality of the game's combat elements;[117][108][122] Push Square's Bayne lauded its pacing and length.[110] Some found the mode incongruous with the narrative's themes discouraging violence and felt it lacked the thematic and narrative justification of God of War Ragnarök's roguelike mode,[108][113][122] while others found its gameplay repetitive and upgrades inconsequential.[108][119][113] No Return's gameplay elements drew comparisons to the canceled multiplayer game The Last of Us Online.[113][123] The scrapped levels and audio commentary were praised for providing insight into the development process,[117][113][118] named by some as Remastered's standout feature;[111][112][122] Push Square's Bayne hoped other developers would imitate it.[110] Several reviewers lauded the US$10 price point for existing owners.[117][108][111]

Audience response
The Last of Us Part II was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, resulting in a user review score of 3.4/10 at its nadir.[124][125] Reporters noticed the review bombing occurred shortly after the game launched—too early for users to feasibly have finished it;[126] some suggested that the reviews were based on the incomplete plot leaks.[100][125] Many negative reviews criticized the characterization and plot;[124][126] some complained of "social justice warrior" politics, with vitriolic responses to LGBT characters.[100][124] CNET's Daniel Van Boom wrote that the review bombers did not represent the majority of players,[127] while Kotaku's MacLeod identified thousands of positive reviews and felt Metacritic's system, which emphasizes scores over critique, comprised only "a bunch of meaningless numbers and a lot of rage".[126] The incident led Metacritic to implement a 36-hour waiting period after release before allowing user reviews.[128]

Some players criticized Joel's death in the opening hours, perceiving a discrepancy between his cautious nature in the first game and his more trustful and protective attitude in Part II.[129][130] Den of Geek's Matthew Byrd wrote that Joel had protected young women in the past, so his trusting of Abby in Part II was not "entirely unreasonable".[129] Sam Clench of News.com.au also argued that Joel's time in Jackson had realistically made him less cynical over the years.[130] A number of players considered Joel's brutal and undignified death "disrespectful";[130][131][132] Clench rebutted that it was realistic, as most real deaths occur at unfortunate times, and described the scene as "extremely strong, purposeful writing".[130] Josh Hawkins of Shacknews wrote that Joel's death was a fitting retribution for his brutal actions and murders in the previous game.[132] Some players felt the marketing, which had altered and replaced characters in trailers to conceal Joel's death and Abby's role, constituted false advertising;[127][129][131] Druckmann responded that Naughty Dog had intended to preserve the game experience, "not to bamboozle anyone or get their $60".[65]

A subset of players criticized Abby and disapproved of her playable chapters as they had expected to control Ellie for the majority of the game.[129][133][134] Collider's Dave Trumbore felt Abby's killing of Joel led to her being unfairly maligned by audiences who had failed to understand the story's message.[135] Some players criticized Abby's muscular physique, and theories spread online that she was transgender; The Independent's Amy Coles and Polygon's Patricia Hernandez argued that this perception was a result of the lack of body diversity in games, and that the story showed Abby had the resources to achieve her physique.[134][136] Coles observed that these arguments were propagated by "a loud and determinedly misogynistic subset" of players.[134] Laura Bailey, who played Abby, became the target of online death threats in response to the character;[137] Naughty Dog released a statement condemning the threats, and Bailey was supported by James Gunn, Ashley Johnson, and Craig Mazin, among others.[138]

Some members of the transgender community objected to the representation of Lev, a transgender supporting character. Criticism focused on villains using Lev's deadname, that the character was created by cisgender writers, and the use of trans stories as tragedies.[139][140] Stacey Henley of VG247 responded that Lev's deadname is used sparingly and that Ian Alexander, a transgender actor, provides the character's voice and motion capture.[139] Writing for Paste, Waverly praised the choice to have Lev played by a transgender actor, but felt there was too much emphasis on his gender identity and the suffering he experienced for it. Waverly felt that "Lev's story isn't made for trans people, but to give cisgender players a space to connect with their guilt and pity for trans people".[141] Henley wrote that, while Lev's story is imperfect, it is "a major step for trans characters in gaming, [and] focuses on a highly charismatic and central character who is far more than this transness".[139] Kotaku's MacLeod saw Lev's character as simply a way of acknowledging that trans people exist in the game's universe and wrote that it was up to the player to create their own meaning from the character.[142] Alexander acknowledged the writers "might have missed the mark a little bit" regarding the use of Lev's deadname but felt Abby's response[e] reflected the importance of allowing trans individuals the agency to discuss their gender on their own terms.[143]

A year after the game's release, Collider's Trumbore identified a subset of players that continued to criticize the game and its legacy, comparing it to some audience complaints about Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), though recognized it was "quieter" than at launch.[144] In Games and Culture, Robert Letizi and Callan Norman described a community of users on the subreddit r/TheLastOfUs2 who continued posting hateful and discriminatory content denouncing the game several years after release as "alt-fans". Letizi and Norman linked the reception to the game to alt-right politics and various hate movements and conspiracy theories; they argued the response to Part II was not an outlier but an exemplar of common politically motivated responses to inclusivity in games.[145] In July 2021, a user of the subreddit claimed they received death threats from fans of YouTube channel Girlfriend Reviews, who had posted positive videos about the game; following targeted harassment from the subreddit, Girlfriend Reviews discovered the threats were fabricated by the user.[146][147]

Developer response
Polygon's Hernandez observed that the discourse surrounding The Last of Us Part II had become adversarial, with "bigots" attacking the game for its diverse cast and Naughty Dog becoming defensive.[148] Vice's Zacny claimed that, in response to his critical review, Sony contacted him on behalf of Naughty Dog to discuss his criticisms, which they disagreed with; Zacny said the discussion, while cordial, was unusual from a large publisher.[148] On Twitter, Druckmann expressed disapproval after journalist Jason Schreier mocked a reviewer's comparison of Part II to Schindler's List (1993); Schreier felt his reporting on Naughty Dog's crunch conditions prompted Druckmann's disapproval.[149] A different tweet from Schreier stated that "video games are too long", which he later clarified was criticizing longer games being made for marketing purposes; Baker responded to the original tweet with a quote from US president Theodore Roosevelt about critics being less valuable than creators, which Schreier felt was an overreaction.[148] Hernandez concluded that critics fearing backlash from publishers and fans was "not an environment that is conducive to encouraging honest reviews or critical discussion, which is ultimately a disservice to the game itself".[148] USgamer's Bailey wrote that the strict review embargo prevented meaningful discussion of the narrative.[150] Druckmann acknowledged the leaks prompted the embargo as he had felt reviews discussing plot details would have become more harmful and widespread than the leaks.[65]

Sales
In its release weekend, The Last of Us Part II sold over four million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, beating Marvel's Spider-Man's 3.3 million and God of War's 3.1 million in the same period.[183][184] It had the biggest launch of 2020 for both physical and digital sales.[185] On the PlayStation Store, it was the most-downloaded PlayStation 4 game in North America and Europe in June;[186] in July, it was fifth in North America and tenth in Europe;[187] in November, it was the eighth in North America and seventh in Europe;[188] and overall for 2020, it ranked sixth in North America and eighth in Europe.[189] In the United States, it was the best-selling game of June 2020 and became the third-best-selling game of the year within two weeks, generating the highest first-month sales of the year.[190] By August 2020, it had become the third-highest-grossing PlayStation game in the United States, behind Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War.[191] Overall, it was the sixth-best-selling game of the year in the United States;[192] it was the third-best-selling for PlayStation consoles, and the best-selling PlayStation 4-only game.[193] By June 2022, the game had sold over ten million copies worldwide.[194]

In the United Kingdom, The Last of Us Part II became the fastest-selling physical PlayStation 4 game, outselling previous record holder Uncharted 4 by at least one percent and The Last of Us by 76 percent;[195] it was the nation's eighth-best-selling game of the year with 543,218 copies sold,[196] and the seventh for physical sales.[197] A price discount in February 2021 saw it re-enter the UK physical charts in third place, representing a 3,992 percent increase.[198] In Japan, The Last of Us Part II was the best-selling game during its first week, selling an estimated 178,696 physical copies.[199] In Germany, it sold over 200,000 copies in June 2020[200] and 500,000 by December 2020.[201] In Australia, it was the eighth-best-selling of the year, and the third for physical sales.[202]

Legacy
Critics concurred that The Last of Us Part II was among the best games of the eighth generation of video game consoles[203] and a great closing title before the ninth.[102][123][204][205] An internal review by Sony's competitor Microsoft—published as a court document in the Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit in 2021—said the game "sets a new bar for what we should hope to be able to achieve going into a new generation of consoles".[206][207] Many outlets considered it among the greatest video games ever made,[208] and some called it one of the best-written.[209][210]

The Last of Us Part II is expected to be adapted into multiple seasons of the television adaptation of The Last of Us, starting with the second season,[211] which premiered in April 2025.[212] Druckmann and series co-showrunner Craig Mazin wanted to avoid filler between the seasons, jumping into adapting the sequel immediately.[213] Mazin confirmed plans for a "significantly larger" third season if the second is successful, and suspected Part II's story may require a fourth.[214] Kaitlyn Dever is cast as Abby in the series,[215] alongside Young Mazino as Jesse[216] and Isabela Merced as Dina.[217] Jeffrey Wright is set to reprise his role as Isaac from the game.[218]

Druckmann and Gross wrote an outline for a story set after Part II by April 2021, but noted it was not in active development.[219] Druckmann later clarified the outline was for a "small story" focused on Tommy, rather than a full sequel to Part II ; he felt it would eventually be released, possibly as a game or television series.[220] In 2023, Druckmann confirmed he had a concept for a third main game in the series that is thematically consistent with the first two games, stating there is "probably one more chapter to this story".[220] In March 2025, Druckmann warned not to "bet on there being more of Last of Us ", noting the television series "could be it".[221]

The Last of Us Part II (Naughty Dog, 2020) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES
  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)  
     – Ellie’s shattered-innocent-turned-avenger vs. Abby’s dutiful soldier-
       turned-atoner; both upend “single-note revenge hero” stereotypes.  
  2. Personal Demons and Revenge Cycle (Low Risk)  
     – Guilt, PTSD, and survivor’s shame drive every major choice, not plot
       convenience.  
  3. Dual-Protagonist Perspective Switch (Medium Risk)  
     – Swapping control from Ellie to Abby forces empathy, but risks whiplash
       if momentum stalls or players resist the hand-off.  
  4. Found-Family Bonds Tested (Medium Risk)  
     – Dina, Lev, and Tommy embody shifting surrogate-family roles that either
       soften—or sharpen—each lead’s vendetta.

II. NARRATIVE / THEME-AFFECTING TROPES
 15. Cycle-of-Violence Catalyst (Low Risk)  
     – Joel’s murder ignites chain reactions that purposefully mirror earlier
       Firefly massacre consequences.  
 16. Visual Stillness Before Brutality (Low Risk)  
     – Quiet guitar on a porch, snowfall in a lodge, sun-dappled Seattle streets
       all precede sudden carnage.  
 18. Solitary Transformation Moment (Low Risk)  
     – Ellie’s final barn panic attack and Abby’s pillar crucifixion each mark
       irreversible identity shifts.  
 19. Symbolic Collapse of Hope (Low Risk)  
     – Burning boats, ruined guitars, and broken fingers externalize the
       impossibility of “going back.”  
 20. Environmental Echo of Emotion (Low Risk)  
     – Overgrown baseball stadium, storm-lashed island, and peaceful farmhouse
       mirror rage, chaos, and fragile calm.  
 21. Thematic Final Echo (Low Risk)  
     – Ellie’s aborted chord on Joel’s guitar calls back to their porch duet,
       crystallizing loss and choice.  
 22. Foreshadowed Peripheral Victory (Medium Risk)  
     – Lev’s navigation skills and moral clarity, seeded early, ultimately free
       Abby and break the vendetta loop.  
 24. False-Hope Interlude (Medium Risk)  
     – Jackson dance, aquarium reunion, and Wyoming farm all tease healing
       before the story yanks safety away.  
 25. Character-Driven Chase Stakes (Medium Risk)  
     – Ellie’s pursuit of Abby through crumbling Santa Barbara hideout is fueled
       by obsession, not scripted set-piece logic.

III. GAMEPLAY / CINEMATIC-AFFECTING TROPES
 30. Perspective Reversal Mechanic (Medium Risk)  
     – Hands-on control of “the villain” re-contextualizes previous levels but
       risks pacing fatigue on replay.  
 31. Real-Time Instrument Motif (Low Risk)  
     – Interactive guitar sessions punctuate acts, grounding players in tender
       memory amid brutality.  
 32. Hyper-Tactile Violence (Medium Risk)  
     – Detailed gore and AI callouts heighten stakes, yet flirt with shock
       fatigue if over-used.  
 33. Dynamic Stealth & Name-Calling AI (Low Risk)  
     – Enemies mourn fallen friends, reinforcing humanity without cut-scenes.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR / MISCELLANEOUS TROPES
 34. Marketing Misdirection Device (Medium Risk)  
     – Trailer asset swaps (Joel in place of Jesse) protect twists but risk
       “bait-and-switch” backlash.  
 35. LGBT+ Representation Spotlight (Medium Risk)  
     – Full-fledged queer and trans arcs deepen world-building, though invite
       predictable culture-war blowback.  
 36. Controversial Body Diversity (Medium Risk)  
     – Abby’s hyper-athletic build subverts female-hero norms while exposing the
       story to distracting physique debates.

Resident Evil 4 (2023) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. CHARACTER‑AFFECTING TROPES
  1.  Unflappable Action‑Hero Redux (Low)  
      – Leon returns as the wise‑cracking, stylish gunslinger who never really
        breaks; the remake leans into his established “cool‑under‑fire” persona
        rather than subverting it.  
  2.  Damsel‑to‑Deputy Glow‑Up (Medium)  
      – Ashley sheds the squealing hostage role for “capable sidekick,” but is
        still leverage for tension and escort mechanics.  
  3.  Charming Rogue Redemption (Low)  
      – Luis, the ex‑Umbrella scientist with a conscience, reprises the
        “cowardly helper who dies proving his worth” pattern.  
  4.  Mentor‑Turned‑Nemesis Betrayal (Medium)  
      – Krauser embodies the jaded mentor whose jealousy fuels a boss duel and
        conveniently clarifies the hero’s moral high ground.

II. NARRATIVE / THEME‑AFFECTING TROPES
 15. Cultic Bio‑Terror Conspiracy (Low)  
      – Rural villagers under mind‑control parasites reprise the franchise’s
        mad‑science‑meets‑occult formula.  
 16. Timed Virus Infection Stakes (Low)  
      – Hero and rescue target are both infected, imposing a countdown that
        justifies constant forward momentum—and a lab cure finale.  
 17. Multi‑Stage Castle Gauntlet (Medium)  
      – Story built around three self‑contained arenas (village, castle,
        island), each escalating scale and spectacle in predictable rhythm.  
 18. Heroic Sacrifice B‑Plot (Low)  
      – Luis’s classic “hand‑over‑the‑key‑then‑die” moment pushes Leon toward
        the climax but rarely shocks series veterans.  
 19. Power‑Hungry Madman Monologue (Low)  
      – Saddler’s world‑domination speech ticks the Resident Evil villain box
        without fresh philosophical stakes.  
 20. Hidden Puppet‑Master Tease (Medium)  
      – Wesker’s cameo sets up future calamity, a well‑worn hook that
        intentionally keeps players in the franchise funnel.  
 21. Post‑Credits Betrayal Stinger (Medium)  
      – Ada’s double‑cross keeps the moral waters muddy but ultimately mirrors
        her perpetual “frenemy” loop from past entries.  

III. GAMEPLAY / CINEMATIC‑AFFECTING TROPES
 30. Modernized Yet Nostalgic Gun‑Fu (Low)  
      – Over‑the‑shoulder reticle, hip‑parry knife, and suplex returns satisfy
        action cravings but seldom surprise.  
 31. Companion‑Protection Overhaul (Medium)  
      – Ashley’s “stay close / back off” toggle refreshes escort tension yet can
        still bottleneck pacing during large firefights.  
 32. Resource Tetris Extreme (Low)  
      – Attaché‑case inventory and on‑the‑fly crafting remain beloved puzzle‑
        loops, but feel familiar after a decade of imitators.  
 33. Crowd‑Control Hordes + Environmental Gizmos (Low)  
      – Barricading windows, tipping lanterns, and explosive barrels reinforce
        classic arena management rather than introducing new verbs.  
 34. QTE → Parry Conversion (Medium)  
      – Swapping button‑mash prompts for timing‑based knife parries reduces
        meme‑worthy frustration but is still a genre staple.

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR / MISCELLANEOUS TROPES
 35. Catch‑Phrase Fan Service (Low)  
      – Leon’s “Where’s everyone going? Bingo.” and Merchant’s “Stranger!” play
        the nostalgia card exactly where expected.  
 36. Micro‑Transaction Upgrade Shortcut (Medium)  
      – Post‑launch “pay‑to‑tune‑up” tickets nod to modern monetization, risking
        canon dissonance for convenience.  
 37. Voice‑Actor Backlash Cycle (Medium)  
      – Online harassment of Ada’s new actor echoes recurring fandom gatekeeping
        whenever a legacy role changes hands.  
 38. Anime‑Parody Promo Spot (Low)  
      – Capcom’s cutesy TV ad offers tonal whiplash but keeps the series’
        self‑aware camp alive.

It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in April 2020 and for Amazon Luna, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in June 2022, with a Nintendo Switch cloud version released in November 2022. The Apple version (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) was released in March 2025.

Most of Resident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2; both games run on Capcom's RE Engine. Although it features the same premise as the original, many parts were rearranged in favor of a more focused story. To honor the more action-oriented approach of the original, developers revamped the movement speed and animations from the Resident Evil 2 remake and added the ability to dodge attacks. Because some features from the original game were excluded, a separate online multiplayer game, Resident Evil: Resistance, was bundled with Resident Evil 3.

The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its compelling narrative, tense atmosphere, and graphics. Criticism was targeted at its short length and substantial amount of missing content from the original. The greater emphasis on action and scripted sequences disappointed some critics. The game had sold 9.2 million units by November 2024.[1]

Gameplay

The player, controlling Jill Valentine from an over-the-shoulder perspective, confronts Nemesis.
Resident Evil 3 is a survival horror third-person shooter game.[2] The player controls Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine through most of the game; certain sections require the player to control a supporting character, Carlos Oliveira for short periods.[3] The player must explore the environment to open doors, climb ladders and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that can be accessed at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible.[4] The player may pick up maps to reveal unexplored sections in the game's automap, which shows the player's current position and indicates if an area still has items to collect.[5] Cutscenes with occasional quick time events are featured at regular intervals to advance the story.[6]

As the player progresses through the game, a variety of computer-controlled monsters will try to hinder the player's progress.[3] The player can acquire and use multiple weapons, including combat knives, firearms, and grenades.[7] Some weapons can be customized with additional parts to improve their performance.[8] A creature called Nemesis is the game's primary antagonist and pursues the player in key moments.[9] He gradually mutates into more aggressive forms as the player defeats him during several encounters.[10] The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when Jill or Carlos takes damage.[11] On higher difficulty settings, ammunition and health recovery items are scarce, and getting past opponents without killing them is generally encouraged.[12] Jill has the ability to dodge incoming attacks at close range, while Carlos can perform melee attacks to stagger opponents.[13] If Jill or Carlos dies, the player must start the game again from the last save point.[9]

Once the player completes the game on the highest difficulty setting, two additional difficulty modes can be unlocked. These disable autosaves, make opponents tougher to defeat, change certain encounters, and rearrange item locations.[14] Additionally, upon completing the game for the first time, an item shop is unlocked in the game's main menu, allowing the player to spend points on in-game advantages such as new weapons and items that boost the player's healing and damage. Points are earned by completing a number of challenges, ranging from finding all weapon upgrades to destroying hidden bobbleheads known as Charlie dolls.[15] Unlocking items is essential to completing the game's most challenging difficulty modes.[14]

Plot
On September 28, 1998, 24 hours prior to the events of Resident Evil 2, most of Raccoon City's citizens have turned into zombies as the result of an outbreak of the T-virus, a mutagenic virus secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Jill Valentine, former member of the Raccoon Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent bioweapon known as the Nemesis T-Type, specifically programmed by Umbrella to eliminate all surviving S.T.A.R.S. members. Briefly joined by fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer Brad Vickers before he is killed by zombies, Jill evades Nemesis and is rescued by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary Carlos Oliveira. Carlos explains that he and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - Mikhail Victor, Tyrell Patrick, and Nicholai Ginovaef - have set up subway trains to evacuate civilians from the city. Jill helps them reactivate power to the subway and departs on a train with Nicholai and Mikhail, while Carlos and Tyrell remain behind to find Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who may have developed a vaccine for the T-virus.

After Mikhail expresses his suspicions toward Nicholai over how their platoon was ambushed by zombies, Nemesis attacks the train and kills the civilians. Nicholai betrays and locks Jill and Mikhail out, with the latter sacrificing himself by detonating an explosive that derails the train. Meanwhile, reaching the police department on the notion that Bard is at the S.T.A.R.S. office, Carlos and Tyrell learn the scientist took refuge at a nearby hospital. Carlos is contacted by Jill, who survived the crash while being pursued by a mutating Nemesis. She manages to escape and defeat Nemesis, but loses consciousness after the monster infects her with the T-virus. Carlos finds Jill half a day later and takes her to the hospital, hoping to find a cure. There, he also learns that Bard was murdered, and a video entry from the scientist reveals that Umbrella's board is wiping out the vaccines and any evidence connecting the company to the T-Virus. After Carlos retrieves Bard's vaccine and administers it to Jill, Tyrell discovers that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-virus infestation. Carlos travels to a lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whomever he can to prevent the missile strike.

Jill wakes on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and follows Carlos to the lab. Tyrell informs her that the U.S. government will not launch the missiles if they can retrieve a vaccine from the lab within a few hours. Although Nemesis kills Tyrell shortly afterward, Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine. She also learns that Nicholai is a supervisor hired by an unknown contractor to sabotage Umbrella's efforts to hide their involvement while collecting combat data on the company's bioweapons, including Nemesis. An encounter with Nemesis prompts Nicholai to retrieve the vaccine from Jill as he leaves her to fight the monster. Jill eliminates Nemesis with a railgun and confronts Nicholai on a helipad. Nicholai destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that the city's fate is not important as long as he gets paid for sabotaging Umbrella. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai, prompting Jill to shoot and injure the man. Disgusted by his greed, Jill escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai behind. As the city is destroyed by the missile strike, Jill vows to take down Umbrella at all costs.

Development
Resident Evil 3 was developed by Capcom as a remake of the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, which was released for PlayStation in 1999.[16] The idea of producing such a remake was considered shortly after Capcom had started development on the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2.[17] Because Capcom had previously remastered the 2002 remake of the original Resident Evil in 2015, completing the trilogy became part of their goal.[17] Capcom was assisted by subsidiary K2 Inc and external companies Red Works and M-Two, the latter being founded by former PlatinumGames CEO Tatsuya Minami. PlatinumGames veteran Kiyohiko Sakata, who had originally worked on the first four Resident Evil games as a programmer and designer, was the game's director.[18] While development on Resident Evil 3 and the Resident Evil 2 remake did not start at the same time, there was a significant development overlap between both projects.[17] As a result, both games share certain technologies and run on Capcom's proprietary RE Engine.[19]

Some people who had worked on the original game were involved in the project and had an opportunity to rebuild their vision of what Raccoon City should look like.[19] Because Resident Evil 3 takes place almost concurrently with the events of Resident Evil 2, the development team decided to tie both stories together more than in the originals.[19] Improving the pace of the story and developing better characterizations, especially the relationship between Jill and Carlos, were a major priority.[16] The team wanted Jill to be resilient and capable of surviving nearly impossible odds, while Carlos was designed to feel like her true ally.[16] Their outfits were altered accordingly, with Jill wearing more practical apparel and Carlos sporting a grittier look.[16] Capcom used the likeness of Russian model Sasha Zotova as the basis for Jill's facial appearance.[20] To honor the more action-oriented approach of the original game, the team revamped the movement speed and animations from the Resident Evil 2 remake, and included a counter action which allows the player to automatically aim at an opponent's head after dodging an attack.[21]

The process of designing Nemesis went through several iterations.[22] Although the art team made sure the new character model stayed true to the original concept,[22] they redesigned it so that it could fit into a reimagined and photorealistic setting.[23] One of the most notable changes from the original design is the fact that he now wears bodybags instead of clothes.[24] According to the game's director, Kiyohiko Sakata, this aesthetic choice was made to show that "Nemesis is not a completed model, but a prototype."[25] In an interview with PlayStation Blog, Sakata further explained that Nemesis's new attire was meant to be "restrictive gear that was haphazardly, quickly created to contain it, which is why it has such visuals."[25] The game's producer, Peter Fabiano, further noted that the redesign was a way for the remake to "keep to the essence of the original game, but at the same time modernize it."[22] Sakata initially wanted Nemesis to actively look for and stalk the player throughout the game, but after he saw that the Resident Evil 2 team was programming the Tyrant in their game to behave in this way, he realized that players that are familiar with Resident Evil 2 would not be surprised by his game's enemy.[26] As a result, the team improved the artificial intelligence of Nemesis so that he could use weapons, grab Jill with his tentacles, and jump long distances to appear right next to her.[16] The team wanted to give players the feeling that they were constantly being pursued by a relentless opponent, but they also wanted to give players periods of respite and make them believe that Jill could defeat him.[23]

Although Resident Evil 3 features the same premise as the original game, many parts were rearranged, especially when compared to the Resident Evil 2 remake,[27] and several locations from the original were cut—namely, the clock tower, the graveyard, the park, and city hall.[28] Conversely, the game's storytelling and dialogue were expanded significantly because Sakata wanted to tell a more consistent story.[29] In particular, Carlos has a more prominent role.[30] The original game's multiple endings and live choices, which affect how the story unfolds, were entirely removed in favor of a more focused story.[29] Additionally, the Mercenaries - Operation: Mad Jackal mode, which involves the player trying to escape the city within a time limit, was excluded from the remake.[31] However, Capcom decided that Resident Evil 3 would be bundled with Resident Evil: Resistance, a separate online multiplayer game developed by a Taiwanese company called NeoBards.[21] Around 90% of the game was complete by January 2020, with the remaining work to be done being final adjustments.[27] The game's overall development time took three years to complete.[17]

Marketing and release
Resident Evil 3 was officially announced during Sony's State of Play livestream presentation on December 10, 2019,[32] shortly after development on the game had been hinted by several sources.[33] A tease referencing the game was then added to the Resident Evil 2 remake via an update, awarding players with an achievement if they found and read an in-game letter left behind by Jill.[34] A demo was released on March 19, 2020, allowing players to play a small portion of the full game before its release,[35] while a new trailer that focused on Jill was released on March 27, 2020.[36] If the game was pre-ordered at certain retailers, players would receive an exclusive downloadable content pack that included Jill's original outfit and Carlos' original hairstyle.[37]

Resident Evil 3 was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on April 3, 2020.[32] A launch trailer was also released, reminding buyers that Resident Evil: Resistance is freely included in the package with every purchase of the game.[38] A collector's edition was made available for the console versions, featuring extras such as a Jill Valentine figurine, a hardcover art book, a Raccoon City map poster, and a two-disc soundtrack.[37] In Europe, physical copies of the game were reported to likely be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] A board game based on Resident Evil 3 was released by Capcom on April 28, 2020, supporting up to four players and featuring a 19-hour campaign with an overarching storyline.[40] A downloadable content pack that allows players to unlock Jill's S.T.A.R.S costume and items from the in-game shop without the need of completing challenges was released in August 2020.[41]

Versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were announced on March 2, 2022, and released digitally on June 13, 2022 alongside upgrades for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the Resident Evil 2 remake.[42] These versions include visual enhancements including ray-tracing and high-framerate modes, with the PlayStation 5 version also supporting haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Owners of the game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are able to upgrade for free, and a free upgrade patch for the Windows version was released simultaneously.[43] A version for Amazon Luna was announced on May 26, 2022, and was released on June 10, 2022.[44] A Nintendo Switch cloud version was released on November 18, 2022.[45][46] In 2025, a iOS, iPadOS, and macOS version was released.[47]

Resident Evil 3 received "generally favorable reviews" on Metacritic and a 79% score on OpenCritic.[48][49][50][59] In a very positive review, IGN considered Resident Evil 3 as strong as its acclaimed predecessor, stating that the game "does an amazing job of recapturing the horror and tension of the late '90s original while completely modernizing its gameplay."[3] Game Informer described it as "an incredible thrill ride" from start to finish.[2] GameRevolution agreed, calling the game short yet exhilarating, and remarked that it exceeds the original in presentation and storytelling.[12] Destructoid noted the "remake of Resident Evil 3 is going to be divisive, just as the original was."[52] Other critics were less enthusiastic towards the game.[9][57][58] GameSpot stated that, although the opening hours are very effective, the game fails to sustain the same level of excellence when its scope begins to narrow towards the end.[9] PC Gamer called Resident Evil 3 "an extremely shallow game, with lavish production values failing to mask just how rushed and unambitious it feels."[57]

The game's presentation and visuals were highlighted very positively, with critics praising the detailed and polished environments,[3] tense atmosphere,[9] lighting effects,[60] and interesting and varied locations.[56] Destructoid lauded the remakes character models and aesthetics, stating they add to the sense of dread you feel as you fight through the city piece by piece.[52] IGN praised the storytelling for delivering dramatic moments that carry the gameplay without unnecessary exposition,[3] while Edge magazine said that the game was better written than its predecessor because it knows how to embrace the original's pulpiness while modernizing its characters.[53] Critics also felt that the game had determined and likeable characters,[60][3][54] especially Jill and Carlos, who were said to be believable and realistic.[58] The fact that the game often relies on scripted gameplay moments and cinematic set pieces disappointed some critics.[57][58][9][60] VG247 explained that Nemesis is only active in a small portion of the game, and that he is primarily featured in scripted sequences or boss fights.[58] This led some critics to believe that he was underused and that a lot of his potential was wasted.[58][54]

Critics generally agreed that Resident Evil 3 lacks its predecessor's depth because it places more emphasis on moment-to-moment action than exploration and puzzle solving.[56][12][57][9] However, some noted that the game is far from being as action-heavy as Resident Evil 6,[3][54] and that it still involves the item micromanagement common to early Resident Evil games.[3][9][53] In particular, GamesRadar+ compared the hospital area to the police station of the Resident Evil 2 remake because it requires players to gradually unravel it as they progress.[56] Although the dodge ability was considered a welcome addition,[54][3][9] the timing window to execute it was said to be inconsistent.[2] Some critics also considered the combat and gunplay to be less satisfying than that of its predecessor.[58][57]

A frequently criticized aspect of the game was its short length and lack of substantial replay value.[12][9][57][54][60] GameSpot explained that the fact that the game follows the same premise as the original but excludes some locations such as the clock tower and park, making its short length even more apparent.[9] GameRevolution said that, although Resident Evil 3 omits some areas from the original, it also introduces and expands others, calling the game more of a reimagining than a genuine remake.[12] Edge argued that the game's short length was not an issue, stating that it is comparable to that of the original game and should take between six and eight hours to complete for the first time. The magazine also remarked that, while the original's multiple endings and live choices certainly encourage subsequent playthroughs, so do the remake's unlockable items that are needed for speedruns, and concluded that Resident Evil 3 is more faithful to the original in spirit than in content.[53]

At The Game Awards 2020, Resident Evil 3 was nominated for Best Audio Design, but lost to The Last of Us Part II.[61] At IGN's Game of the Year Awards 2020, Resident Evil 3 was nominated for Best Action-Adventure Game and Best Remake/Remaster, but lost to The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake, respectively.[62][63] It was one of the recipients of the Award for Excellence at the Japan Game Awards 2021.[64]

Sales
Resident Evil 3 shipped more than two million units in its first five days of release, although Capcom stated that nearly half of the game's sales were digital.[65] In Japan, the PlayStation 4 version sold more than 189,000 units in its first week of release, becoming the second best-selling retail game of the week, behind Animal Crossing: New Horizons.[66] Resident Evil 3 had sold 2.5 million units by May 2020,[67] and 2.7 million units by June 30, 2020.[68] Although the latter is a 55% decline from its predecessor's 4.2 million copies sold within a similar time span, Capcom considered the game's sales to be solid and in line with their expectations.[68] In January 2021, Capcom reported that the game had sold 3.6 million units.[69] In October 2021, the company reported that Resident Evil 3 had sold 3.9 million units, calling the game a "hit".[70] According to Capcom's 2021 Integrated Report, the game had sold 4.6 million units by November 2021, with a large portion of these being digital.[71] By January 2023, the game had sold 6.4 million units.[72] By June 2023, it had sold 7.6 million units.[73] At the end of 2023 the total sales had reached 8.4 million units.[1]

Resident Evil 2[a] is a 2019 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. A remake of the 1998 game Resident Evil 2, it was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in January 2019 and for Amazon Luna, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch in 2022. Versions for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS were released in December 2024. Players control the rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and the college student Claire Redfield as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a zombie outbreak.

Capcom considered remaking Resident Evil 2 following the release of the remake of the first Resident Evil in 2002, but the producer, Shinji Mikami, did not want to divert development from Resident Evil 4 (2005). Capcom announced the Resident Evil 2 remake in 2015 and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at E3 2018. It was built on the RE Engine, which was also used for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.

Resident Evil 2 received acclaim for its presentation, gameplay and faithfulness to the original. It won the Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year and was nominated for the Game Award for Game of the Year. By September 2024, it had sold 14.5 million units,[1] outselling the original Resident Evil 2 and becoming the best-selling Resident Evil game. It was followed by the remakes Resident Evil 3 in 2020 and Resident Evil 4 in 2023.

Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror third person shooter game – unlike the remake of the first game, which sought to update and improve the original experience, this remake reimagines the gameplay and story for modern audiences.[2][3] The game is set in Raccoon City, a fictional mountain city in the Midwest, during a zombie apocalypse. Players choose from one of two characters, Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield. Their choice affects the weapons, areas, items, subplot, supporting characters (Leon has Ada Wong, a mysterious federal agent investigating the Umbrella Corporation, and Claire has Sherry Birkin, the young daughter of an Umbrella executive being pursued by a monster) and the final boss.[4]


Gameplay of the remake. The player, as Claire Redfield, fights a "Licker" zombie in the underground portion of the police station. The grenade launcher's Flame Rounds allow Claire to light enemies on fire.
The player is able to freely explore the environment around them while scavenging for resources such as healing items, ammunition, and key items used to solve puzzles and advance the story. Due to the technical and graphical upgrades offered by the RE Engine, the environment is rendered in full 3D using photorealism, improving its appearance and allowing for the tank controls of the original version to be replaced with a more flexible control scheme similar to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard – the player can move in any direction, rotate the camera around their character, alternate between walking and sprinting, and move around while shooting (however, standing still while aiming will tighten the crosshair, improving the accuracy and power of gunshots). Many areas are dark, requiring use of a flashlight to see in and adding an element of horror.

As the player explores, they encounter zombies and other hostile creatures that attack and attempt to kill them. The player is armed with various weapons – both Leon and Claire have their own handguns, their other weapons differ (Leon has a shotgun, magnum, and flamethrower, while Claire has a grenade launcher, submachine gun, and the "Spark Shot" stun gun).[5] Knives and grenades, both regular and stun grenades can be found and used as sub-weapons – if an enemy pins the player, they can use a sub-weapon to push them off and save themselves from taking damage, albeit at the cost of decreased effectiveness.[6] Zombies are much stronger than in the original, able to take more bullets before going down, get back up after being knocked down unless their head was blown off, and chase the player into different rooms. The damage model has been greatly improved, with enemies reacting to damage from gunshots in real-time and capable of having limbs blown off. Taking damage decreases the player's health, shown by a heart rate monitor in the inventory menu, and if the player takes too much damage, they will die, forcing the player to restart from their last save point. Health items such as herbs and first aid spray can be used to heal.[7]

The player has an inventory with eight slots which they can use to store their items and equipment. The space available can be expand by finding hip pouches.[8] Items in the inventory can be examined in a 3D model viewer, often used to reveal the purpose of key items, combined with others to produce beneficial items,[9][10] such as combining gunpowder to create ammunition or herbs to create stronger herbal blends, or discarded if they have served their purpose. Safe rooms which enemies cannot enter contain item boxes, which can store spare items to be retrieved later, and typewriters, which can be used to save the player's progress – unless playing on Hardcore difficulty, the ink ribbons have been removed, allowing the player to save as much as they want (though the number of saves is still tracked).[citation needed]

The player frequently encounters the Tyrant, a mysterious B.O.W. developed to hunt down and kill survivors. The Tyrant cannot be killed, only momentarily brought down or stunned, and will follow the player throughout the environment except into safe rooms, forcing the player to incorporate stealth tactics to evade him as they search for puzzles and items required to progress. Both protagonists have a section where their supporting partner briefly becomes playable – Ada can use an EMF gun to hack and overload electronic devices, while Sherry can crouch to fit through small gaps and focuses more on stealth. Beating the game unlocks the "2nd Run" for the other protagonist, which remixes item locations and contains the true final boss and ending to the story. The remake adds difficulty modes, Assisted, Standard, and Hardcore, which determine the abundance of items, strength of enemies, and whether the game autosaves or requires ink ribbons to use typewriters.[citation needed]

Both of the bonus modes, "The 4th Survivor" and "The Tofu Survivor", return – the former is unlocked after beating the 2nd Run and sees special agent Hunk attempt to go from the lower waterway of the sewers to a rescue helicopter outside the police station while battling through a large gauntlet of enemies. Beating it unlocks "The Tofu Survivor", which replaces Hunk with a block of tofu that only has knives – however, the remake adds characters to this mode, who have a unique item loadout. Completing specific in-game objectives, or "Records", will reward the player with concept art, 3D models of characters and items, or in some cases, special weapons with unlimited ammunition or durability.[citation needed]

The Ghost Survivors
"The Ghost Survivors" is a free bonus mode that is available from the beginning, and focuses on a series of "what-if" scenarios – each scenario depicts an alternate timeline where a side character who dies in the main story survives, and the player can control them as they attempt to reach a specific area in a manner similar to "The 4th Survivor" – unlike that mode, however, "The Ghost Survivors" contains special zombie types, zombies with backpacks that can be looted after killing them, and resupply machines that lets the player choose one of three items to take from it. The modes contain a "Training" difficulty, which gives the player an increased starting inventory and the benefits of Assisted difficulty but does not track the player's completion time.[citation needed]

"No Time to Mourn" features gun shop owner Robert Kendo, who must get from the gun shop to the proposed water purification room in the sewers to reach a rescue helicopter. His mode features poison zombies, who can poison the player with their bite and release a cloud of poison after dying, and zombies wearing propane tanks that can be shot to cause a damaging explosion.[citation needed]
"Runaway" features Katherine Warren, the mayor's daughter, who must get from the director's room of the orphanage to the jail in the police station to save her boyfriend Ben, another side character who dies in the main story. Her mode features "Pale Heads", which are faster than regular zombies and have regenerative abilities.[citation needed]
"Forgotten Soldier" features Ghost, a special ops agent like Hunk, who must get to the cable car of the laboratory to escape before the self-destruct sequence activates. His mode features the Tyrant and zombies wearing bulletproof armor.[citation needed]
"No Way Out", unlocked by clearing the main story, features Sheriff Daniel Cortini. Cortini is the only character who has different gameplay from the others – here, he must hold out in the gas station against waves of zombies breaking in and kill 100 (70 in Training) to be rescued by Leon and complete the scenario. His mode features every special zombie type seen in the previous modes.[citation needed]
"The Ghost Survivors" has its own set of Records separate from the main story, which unlock cosmetic hats the player can wear. While these have no effect on gameplay, one, the cat ears, grants infinite ammo.[citation needed]

Synopsis
Plot
On the night of September 30, 1998[11] two months after the events of Resident Evil, rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy makes his way toward Raccoon City to start his first shift at the Raccoon City Police Department. At a gas station on the city outskirts, he meets Claire Redfield, who is looking for her brother, Chris Redfield. The gas station is suddenly overrun by zombies, as well as the rest of Raccoon City, after a strain of the T-virus contaminated the city's water supply.[12] The two reach the police station but are forced to separate when a truck crashes and explodes, and later discover the station to be swarming with zombies. The player character finds an infected Lieutenant Marvin Branagh, who reveals a secret passage leading out of the station before later succumbing to his bite. While exploring the police station, the player character may also be pursued by the Tyrant, a humanoid bioweapon created and programmed by the Umbrella Corporation to eliminate everyone within the station. The player character[b] eventually reaches the underground passage, where they are attacked by a mutated William Birkin, Umbrella's leading scientist, whom they fight off before escaping.

In the parking garage, Leon is attacked by zombie dogs, but is saved by Ada Wong. Ada claims to be an FBI agent sent to retrieve an incriminating sample of the G-virus, the virus responsible for Birkin's mutation, which he developed with his wife and coworker Annette.[13] Meanwhile, Claire finds paperwork revealing her brother had left Raccoon City weeks prior to investigate Umbrella overseas. She runs into a lost Sherry Birkin, the young daughter of William and Annette, and resolves to protect her.

After investigating Umbrella, news reporter Ben Bertolucci is detained in a holding cell by the corrupt police chief and serial killer Brian Irons, who has been covering up Umbrella's activities. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant suddenly attacks them, killing the former. Leon and Ada flee and reach Robert Kendo's gun shop, where they find Robert and his infected daughter Emma. Witnessing Robert put down his daughter before committing suicide, Leon decides to help Ada retrieve the G-virus sample to expose Umbrella's corruption. The two encounter Annette in the sewers, who shoots Leon in the back before escaping to Umbrella's underground lab, NEST, unwilling to give up the G-virus sample.[14] Leon recovers; he and Ada kiss as they descend into NEST.

Meanwhile, Sherry is abducted and taken to the Raccoon City Orphanage by Irons.[15] William arrives and injects Irons with a "G-embryo", which bursts from Irons' stomach, killing him. He incapacitates Claire and deliberately infects Sherry, confident that her body will accept the G-virus and allow it to replicate.[16]

Finding Sherry and descending underground into NEST, Claire retrieves a vaccine for the G-virus, which Annette administers to her daughter. Meanwhile, Leon retrieves the G-virus sample and runs into Annette again, who outs Ada as a mercenary intending to sell the sample to the highest bidder. William kills Annette; Ada demands the sample from Leon at gunpoint, but is knocked off into the abyss below NEST, along with the sample, as the facility starts to self-destruct.[17] Leon then defeats the mutated and deadlier "Super Tyrant" after Ada, having survived her fall, throws him a rocket launcher before departing. He, Claire, and Sherry escape on a train out of the facility, where they are attacked by William once more in his final mutated form. Fortunately, the train decouples and William is destroyed in the lab's destruction. As the three reach safety, Leon and Claire vow to continue their fight against Umbrella.[18]

The Ghost Survivors
In No Time to Mourn, the player controls Robert Kendo, the owner of gun shop Kendo. While Robert survived the initial fallout, he lost his will to live after both his wife and his daughter Emma succumbed to the T-virus. Robert is encountered briefly in Leon's campaign after Leon escapes the police station, putting down his daughter before committing suicide. In this alternate scenario, before Robert can pull the trigger on his shotgun, he receives a radio message from a longtime friend, who managed to call a rescue helicopter for them both to escape in. Bidding goodbye to his daughter, Robert reaches the helicopter in the sewers and escapes from Raccoon City unharmed.

In Runaway, the player controls Katherine Warren, the mayor's daughter, who was invited to the orphanage by Chief Irons to see her boyfriend Ben, only to be attacked by Irons and killed. Her corpse can be found on a table in the director's room. In the alternate scenario, Katherine manages to grab a knife off the table and stab Irons in the throat, killing him. Taking the prison keys off his corpse, Katherine makes her way back to the police station, where she reaches Ben's cell and frees him. The two lovers then embrace each other in a hug, though their fate is left uncertain.

In Forgotten Soldier, the player controls Ghost, a special ops agent who was killed by William Birkin after he mutated into G. In this alternate scenario, Ghost narrowly survives the encounter and makes his way to NEST to finish his mission in securing the G-Virus sample. Searching the facility moments before it self-destructs, he retrieves the G-Virus sample dropped after Ada's fall. Ghost manages to escape on a cable car and sets off for safety, but is then held at gunpoint by Ada, who takes the sample off him. Ghost's fate is left uncertain.

In No Way Out, the player controls Daniel Cortini, a local sheriff who investigates the gas station following reports of cannibalistic murders in the area - he is killed by the first zombie the player encounters and turns soon after. In the alternate scenario, Daniel manages to overpower and kill the zombie but becomes trapped inside the station as it goes under siege. Fending off numerous waves of zombies, Daniel is eventually saved by Leon just as he is overpowered, and the two set off for Raccoon City in the same manner as the beginning of the game. Their fate is left uncertain, although it is implied that Cortini would take Claire's place in the story.



Development

Promotional booth at E3 2018
The original Resident Evil 2 was released for the PlayStation in 1998. Following the release of the 2002 remake of the first Resident Evil for the GameCube,[19][20][21] Capcom considered a similar remake of Resident Evil 2, but series creator Shinji Mikami did not want to divert development away from Resident Evil 4.[22] In August 2015, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi announced in a video that the remake had been approved and was in active development, ending the video with the phrase "we do it".[23] No further details were released until Sony's E3 2018 press conference, when Capcom released the debut trailer and gameplay footage and removed "Remake" from the title.[24][25] Hideki Kamiya, director of the original Resident Evil 2, said that he had pushed Capcom to create a remake for years.[26] Hirabayashi said the team was striving to capture the spirit of the original game, and that the team incorporated feedback received about Resident Evil 6, a game he also produced.[27]

To meet modern expectations, the team altered some character designs to better match the more photorealistic setting; for example, Leon no longer wears large shoulder pads, which were added to distinguish his original, low-polygon model. Though they strove to make a "modern, accessible" game, they focused on horror over action, hoping to preserve a claustrophobic feel.[28] The game uses the RE Engine, the same game engine used for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017), which allowed Capcom to modernize the gameplay.[29] Producer Tsuyoshi Kanda acknowledged the difficulty of making zombies seem scary and threatening, as they had become ubiquitous in entertainment media since the release of the original Resident Evil in 1996.[28] By removing the fixed camera angles, the team had to use different ways to conceal enemies, using elements such as room layout, lighting, and smoke.[28] The new camera system affected the sound design, as it no longer made sense for sound to come from a fixed source.[28] The faces of several character models are based on scans of real people - for example, Leon S. Kennedy is based on the model Eduard Badaluta, Claire Redfield is based on the model Jordan McEwen, and Marvin Branagh is based on the music producer Patrick Levar.[30]

The game features a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.[31] Due to Capcom's decision to use non-union voice actors, the original game's actors did not reprise their roles.[32] The game was censored in Japan.[33] It received a "CERO D" rating, as well as an uncensored "Z rating".[34]

Release
Resident Evil 2 was released on PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One worldwide on January 25, 2019.[29] It supports enhancements on the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X, offering either 4K resolution or 60 frames per second.[35] A demo known as the 1-Shot Demo was released on January 11, 2019. It ends after 30 minutes and does not allow repeat playthroughs, however the same demo was rereleased as the "R.P.D. Demo" and does allow repeat playthroughs.[36][37] The 1-Shot Demo received over 4.7 million downloads worldwide.[38] A collector's edition was made available for the console versions, featuring extras such as a Leon S. Kennedy figurine, a hardcover art book, a R.P.D. renovation poster, and a digital soundtrack.[39]

On December 12, 2019, a final update was introduced to the Resident Evil 2 remake where the protagonist of Resident Evil 3, Jill Valentine, has written a letter to Kendo. This letter can be found at Kendo's gun shop right after Leon and Ada escape from the police station. Reading this letter also unlocks an achievement called "Chasing Jill".[40]

Versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were announced on March 2, 2022, and released digitally on June 13, 2022 alongside upgrades for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) and Resident Evil 3 (2020).[41] These versions include visual enhancements including ray-tracing and high-framerate modes, with the PlayStation 5 version supporting haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Owners on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One can upgrade free, and a free upgrade patch for the Windows version was released simultaneously.[42] A version for Amazon Luna was announced on May 26, 2022, and was subsequently released on June 9, 2022.[43][44] A Nintendo Switch cloud version was released on November 11, 2022.[45][46] Versions for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS were released on December 10, 2024.[47]

Downloadable content
Resident Evil 2 contains various downloadable content (DLC) packs. It includes five DLC costumes for Leon and Claire: Leon has a sheriff outfit and a noir outfit, while Claire has a military outfit, a noir outfit, and the motorcycle suit worn by Elza Walker, the protagonist of the original game's development build - the noir outfits allow the player to play using a black-and-white filter. There are also three different variations of the "Samurai Edge" handgun, based on the models used by Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker in the first Resident Evil game, which were also released - the Chris and Jill models were included as bonus for players who pre-ordered the game. Finally, the Original Ver. Soundtrack Swap, allowed the player to replace the soundtrack with the original.

Later, on February 15, 2019, Capcom released the original models for Leon and Claire from the 1998 release as free DLC. A third bonus mode, The Ghost Survivors, features four bonus missions: "No Time to Mourn", "Runaway", "Forgotten Soldier", and "No Way Out".[48][49] The mode centers around side characters who die in the main story, and depicts alternate, non-canon scenarios where they survive. "No Time to Mourn" (featuring gun shop owner Robert Kendo, who commits suicide after putting down his infected daughter), "Runaway" (Katherine Warren, the mayor's daughter who is normally murdered by Chief Irons), and "Forgotten Soldier" (Ghost, a special ops agent who survives G's assault) require the player to reach a destination as they make their way through waves of special enemies, while "No Way Out" (Sheriff Daniel Cortini, who is normally killed by a zombie at the beginning of the game), which is unlocked after completing the other three missions, requires the player to defeat a wave of a hundred zombies inside the gas station from the beginning of the game.

Resident Evil 2 received "universal acclaim" for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, and "generally favorable reviews" for the Windows version from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[50][51][52] OpenCritic reports that 97% of 205 critic reviews recommend the game, with critics praising its scariness, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. The consensus on the website states: "Resident Evil 2 is a gold-standard for how to do a remake, combining the original's nostalgia with modernized and fresh gameplay to bring an awesome experience for players old and new. This may be the best Resident Evil game ever released."[62]

Ben Reeves of Game Informer wrote that "Resident Evil 2 not only looks great, it plays well, and it forces you into a series of dark encounters that are a total rush."[57] Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that it was "a reminder of how beautifully crafted survival horror games were in their heyday."[63] The Daily Telegraph's Tom Hoggins described the game as a "thrilling return to the legacy of the 1998 original".[64]

IGN's Daemon Hatfield originally gave the game an 8.8 in their review, increasing it to a 9.0 after being made aware of the unlockable second playthrough that presents the story from another point of view. He stated in his review that "Capcom did a fantastic job of resurrecting all the best parts of the classic Resident Evil 2 and making it look, sound, and play like a 2019 game."[65]

Chris Carter of Destructoid called the game "A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage."[54] Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer described it as "a masterly reimagining of a modern classic".[66] Polygon's Michael McWhertor wrote that Resident Evil 2 showcases "the very best of survival horror";[67] similar praise was expressed by Heather Alexandra of Kotaku, who wrote that the game "provides some of the best moments in the franchise".[68] Alessandro Fillari of GameSpot said that with Resident Evil 2 "the classic survival horror franchise embraces its past in a new, exciting way".[59]

Sales
Three million copies of Resident Evil 2 were shipped in its first week of release and four million in its first month, with more than one million on Windows.[38][69][70][71] It became Capcom's second biggest launch on Steam after Monster Hunter: World from 2018.[72] Resident Evil 2 debuted at number two on the Japanese charts with 252,848 retail sales, after Kingdom Hearts III.[73][74] As of March, it was among the top 20 bestselling video games in Japan with more than 352,000 sold units.[75] Resident Evil 2 also topped the UK charts, becoming Capcom's biggest UK launch since Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) in physical retail sales, and was the UK's best-selling game in January 2019, despite being available for only two days.[76] By December 2019, the game had sold over 5.8 million units, overtaking the sales of the original Resident Evil 2.[77][78] It had sold over 10 million units by July 2022,[79] and 13.9 million units by March 2024.[1]

Dead Space is a 2023 survival horror game developed by Motive Studio and published by Electronic Arts. A remake of the 2008 game of the same name developed by EA Redwood Shores, it is the first release in the Dead Space series since 2013's Dead Space 3. Like the original game, it is set on the USG Ishimura, a mining spaceship overrun by deadly monsters known as Necromorphs following the discovery of an artifact called the Marker. The player controls engineer Isaac Clarke as he navigates the spaceship and fights the Necromorphs while struggling with growing psychosis.

Plans for a fourth Dead Space game fell through once series developer Visceral Games shut down in 2017, putting the series in a dormant state. EA announced a remake of Dead Space in July 2021, to be developed by EA's Motive Studio. Among lead staff include senior producer Philippe Ducharme, creative director Roman Campos-Oriola, and art director Mike Yazijian, all whom had worked on titles within the Dead Space series. The remake was built in the Frostbite Engine, rebuilding all the systems from scratch for it and introducing new features such as volumetric and dynamic lighting. The game also takes advantage of the newer consoles' solid-state drive systems to create a seamless experience between levels without any loading screens. During development, EA made an explicit decision not to include microtransactions in the game.

Dead Space was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on January 27, 2023. The game received generally positive reviews from critics and was nominated for the Golden Joystick Award for Ultimate Game of the Year.

Gameplay
Dead Space features various changes from the original game. Unlike the original game where he was a silent protagonist, Isaac now has voice lines of his own. In addition, previous voice lines and conversations remade for the game were adjusted to include Isaac, allowing him to engage, argue, and bond with the other characters. The game also features more gore than the original, introducing a "peeling" system in which the player can tear and destroy the bodies of the Necromorphs. Various weapons are more suitable for severing limbs, while others are more suitable for completely destroying bodies. The remake also improves on the "zero gravity" element of the original, providing Isaac with thrusters to freely move across designated areas of the Ishimura.[1]

While featuring all the same suits and weapons from the original game, weapons can now be acquired by simply progressing through the story and do not need to be purchased at the suit kiosk using blueprints. While suits and weapons can still be upgraded with Power Nodes, they can only be fully upgraded by finding different suit blueprints or weapon parts that can be found in different areas of the ship. Weapon parts add on different upgrades, such as increased magazine size or better area-of-effect[2]

The USG Ishimura is featured as a singular environment that can be freely explored without impacting the main story. Divided into six sections (Engineering/Mining, Hydroponics, Flight Deck/Hangar, Medical, Crew Quarters, and Bridge), players can unlock different areas of the Ishimura by proceeding through the main story. While the ship’s tram system can still be used to move to different sections, they are no longer readily available and must be unlocked by proceeding through each section on foot. A new feature added is the ability to access locked doors and containers by rerouting the ship’s power through various junction boxes or by using a security clearance instead of having to sacrifice Power Nodes.[citation needed]

Synopsis
Characters and setting
Set in the 26th century, the story follows starship engineer Isaac Clarke and the crew of the repair vessel Kellion, assigned to the USG Ishimura, a massive planetary mining ship operated by the Concordance Extraction Corporation (CEC) that has gone silent above the planet Aegis VII. The other members of the crew are Kendra Daniels, a private contractor specializing in computer systems, CEC security chief Lt. Zach Hammond, his right-hand man Cpl. Aiden Chen, and helmsman Cpl. Hailey Johnston.[3]

While investigating a distress call, the crew of the Kellion are attacked by Necromorphs, creatures made from mutated human corpses, and separated. Isaac is forced to fend for himself as he tries to save his crewmates and learn the truth behind the loss of the Ishimura. Along the way, he encounters several survivors, including his girlfriend, Senior Medical Officer Dr. Nicole Brennan, horticulturalist and Hydroponics Director Dr. Elizabeth Cross, Cross's boyfriend and Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple, Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne, and his colleague, Special Researcher Dr. Challus Mercer.[3][4][5]

Plot
The Kellion crew arrives at the outskirts of Aegis VII, but they crash-land aboard the Ishimura due to a docking malfunction. An injured Johnston stays behind as Isaac, Kendra, Hammond, and Chen investigate the seemingly abandoned ship. Necromorphs made from the corpses of the Ishimura's crew attack the group, killing Chen and forcing them to separate. As they battle the undead crew, the trio split up to explore the ship and find out what caused the outbreak. The situation soon worsens when the Necromorphs damage the Kellion's singularity core, causing the ship to explode and kill Johnston, while Hammond is attacked by a mutated Chen while searching the ship's bridge. Unwilling to harm his friend, he seals Chen in an escape pod and jettisons him into space. Kendra accesses the Ishimura's central computer and discovers that the ship was harboring a "discovery" from Aegis VII.

While exploring and repairing the damaged Ishimura, Isaac briefly reunites with Nicole and meets Cross, who is trying to find Temple and kill a giant Necromorph called the "Leviathan" that threatens to poison the Ishimura's oxygen supply. Isaac also discovers the presence of the fanatical "Church of Unitology"—a cult that led to his devout Unitologist mother killing his father and herself—and a large Marker, a mysterious icon of Unitology, which apparently caused the outbreak by inducing psychosis in the planet's colonists and later the Ishimura's crew when it was brought aboard at Kyne's request. As Isaac, Kendra, and Hammond are tormented by Marker-induced hallucinations, Isaac encounters Mercer, who reveals his intention to bring the Marker to Earth and cause a phenomenon he calls "Convergence", which will effectively turn the planet's entire population into Necromorphs.

After Isaac launches an emergency beacon crafted by Temple in the mining bay, the signal is tracked by USM Valor, but they succumb to the Marker's influence, having picked up Chen's pod, causing the Valor to crash into the Ishimura. Isaac and Hammond board the former to recover its singularity core and fix an escape shuttle Hammond found. Onboard, the two learn that the Valor had already been contacted by someone aboard the Ishimura and had orders to destroy the ship at all costs. The pair find the core, but Chen attacks Hammond, who sacrifices himself to kill Chen. Isaac retrieves the core and narrowly escapes the Valor before its destruction. Returning to the Ishimura, he encounters a guilt-ridden Kyne, who convinces Isaac and Kendra that they should return the Marker to Aegis VII to stop the outbreak.

While helping Kyne recover the Marker, Isaac re-encounters Mercer, who kills Temple before being crushed to death by Necromorph growths. Isaac loads the Marker onto the shuttle, but Kendra murders Kyne and escapes on her own. She reveals her true identity as a covert agent sent to retrieve the Marker, which she explains is a failed attempt at reverse-engineering the alien technology. The Marker was buried on Aegis VII when it proved too dangerous to control, but the Ishimura—engaged in illegal mining—revealed its presence, resulting in the Valor being sent to scrub the discovery. Before she can flee, Isaac and Nicole recall the shuttle remotely and use it to fly to the surface of Aegis VII, though Kendra flees in an escape pod.

Isaac and Nicole successfully return the Marker to the planet, but Kendra arrives and steals it back. She reveals that Nicole was dead all along, having committed suicide to avoid becoming a Necromorph. The "Nicole" Isaac was working with is actually Cross, who hallucinated Isaac as Temple, and the Marker manipulated them both to return it to the "Hive Mind", an enormous Necromorph that telepathically commands the others. Cross refuses to help Kendra take the Marker off Aegis VII and is killed. Kendra then tries to escape aboard the shuttle, but gets torn apart by the Hive Mind, which Isaac eventually kills. He abandons the Marker and narrowly escapes Aegis VII as the Ishimura's power fails and its payload crashes onto the planet's surface. Alone, Isaac tries to rest before being attacked by a hostile hallucination of Nicole.

In an alternate ending achieved through the New Game Plus mode, Isaac discusses "building something new" with his hallucination of Nicole, having covered the shuttle's interior with the Marker's language.[6]

Development
Background
Prior to Dead Space 3's release, a report indicated Electronic Arts wanted to move the series away from the survival-horror genre once the Dead Space trilogy was complete.[7] During production of Dead Space 3, the team created story and gameplay concepts for the next game, which would have focused on the protagonist scavenging to survive as humanity neared extinction; Wanat envisioned the protagonist as Ellie rather than Isaac. The gameplay would have expanded upon the open, brief, zero-gravity sections in Dead Space 3, redesigned the Necromorphs to work in zero-gravity environments, reworked the crafting system, and incorporated a variety of ships to explore. There was also a concept for the Necromorphs' origin and the measures humanity might have to take to avoid extinction.[8] Ultimately, plans for a fourth Dead Space game were abandoned as the team disbanded to work on other projects.[9][8] Wanat had material planned for up to an envisioned fifth game.[10]

Following the release of Dead Space 3, rumors that Electronic Arts had canceled the series emerged; the company denied these rumors and stated Visceral Games was working on other properties at the time.[11][12] Visceral Games had shifted to work on Battlefield Hardline, which allowed them to become accustomed to the Frostbite game engine, which Electronic Arts was mandating for all of its in-house games.[8] Visceral Games was closed in 2017 amid production on a Star Wars video game project.[13] The Dead Space series remained dormant for ten years.

Production
Games journalist Jeff Grubb of GamesBeat reported that a remake of Dead Space was in development at Motive on July 1, 2021. He speculated that the success of EA's single-player Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019) and Capcom's remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 were instrumental in the publisher's decision to green-light the Dead Space remake.[14]

The game was developed using EA's proprietary Frostbite engine, which Motive Studios previously used to develop Star Wars: Squadrons and the single-player campaign of Star Wars Battlefront II.[15] The game retains the same story and structure as the original but features redesigned assets, character models, and environments. The developers intended to take advantage of SSDs on the ninth generation of consoles to have the game be presented as an "uninterrupted sequence shot", absent of loading screens.[16] Content that was removed from the original game due to technical constraints may also be added.[17] The game does not feature any microtransactions, in contrast to Dead Space 3, where the addition of microtransactions resulted in a negative reception.[18] The art director for the game, Mike Yazijan, previously worked as art director at EA Montreal assisting Visceral Games in developing Dead Space 2.[19]

The original Dead Space was noted for its audio design, and the team intended to stay true to the original atmosphere while improving and modifying where necessary. Gunner Wright reprises his role as Isaac Clarke, who is fully voiced, like his appearances in Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3.[20] Tanya Clarke also reprises her role as Nicole Brennan from Dead Space 2. The other cast members include Anthony Alabi as Zach Hammond, Brigitte Kali Canales as Kendra Daniels, and Faran Tahir as Challus Mercer.[3]

Dead Space went gold on December 15, 2022.[21] The game's implementation of a rendering technique called variable rate shading (VRS) was criticized.[22] The PC version received a patch on January 31, 2023 that added a VRS toggle,[23] while the console versions removed the feature completely.[24]

Release
Dead Space was announced at EA's Play Live event on July 22, 2021, accompanied by a teaser trailer, with an initial target release date of late 2022.[25][26] On March 11, 2022, it was announced that the game was being pushed to early 2023.[27] On October 4, 2022, a gameplay trailer for Dead Space was released, which revealed the game's release date to be January 27, 2023.[28][29]

Music
The original musical score by Jason Graves was retained, with new musical elements and cues composed by Trevor Gureckis.[30][31] Graves had previously worked on the original game trilogy.[32]

Critical reception
Dead Space received "generally favorable" reviews from critics for the PC and PlayStation 5 versions, while the Xbox Series X/S version received "universal acclaim", according to the review aggregator website Metacritic.[33][34][35]

IGN praised Motive Studio for rejuvenating the original game's setting "with its stunningly redesigned spaceship, smartly and subtly enhanced story, and spectacularly re-imagined action scenes".[45] The Guardian described it as a streamlined version of Dead Space, making it flow more smoothly and "embrac[ing] the original's taut pacing and powerful forward-momentum."[53] Eurogamer enjoyed the changes to the Ishimura, calling it "persistent and alive", but felt Isaac's new voice distracted from the horror.[56] Kotaku disliked the unchanged boss fights describing them as "boring" and "methodical".[57]

Polygon praised the new audio system added to the game, "The sounds of the Ishimura are richly layered - the din of machinery and otherworldly screams are a constant amplifier of fear."[58] They also commented on the development of Isaac as a protagonist, praising the interactions that he has with the rest of the crew for improving the emotional stakes.[59] GameSpot felt that the remake had made only marginal improvements on the 2008 version, but still praised it as "the quintessential way to play one of the survival horror genre's best."[42] The Verge liked the updates to the story and Isaac's newly voiced dialogue, writing "Wright imbues the character with an endearing charm that makes him fun not only to protect but also to be around".[60] PC Gamer praised the game for expanding on the original narrative with much more detail, which led them to hope that this effort could be channeled into a legitimate sequel.[47]

Glen Schofield, the creator of 2008's Dead Space, voiced his approval for the remake and praised EA Motive's "faithful" recreation of the original.[61]

Sales
In the United States, Dead Space was the second best-selling game of January 2023, behind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.[62]

In the United Kingdom, the game topped the sales charts, becoming one of the best selling horror IPs in the country, although sales were lower than The Callisto Protocol.[63] Dead Space fell to third and sixth place in the following month.[64][65]

Future
In April 2024, Jeff Grubb of Giant Bomb said that a remake of Dead Space 2 was in the concept phase of development at Motive Studio, but was later cancelled because of the "lackluster" sales of the Dead Space remake. However, EA denied this claim and a source told IGN that the remake was ultimately considered to have done well. Motive is currently developing an Iron Man game and supporting the Battlefield series.[73] Jason Schreier of Bloomberg published an article which reported that after releasing the Dead Space remake, Motive spent a few months exploring ideas for a new series entry, which they wanted to be a sequel to the remake, rather than a remake of Dead Space 2, although both ideas were considered. However, following disappointing sales of the remake, the project was reportedly shelved.[74]

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[b] is a 2015 action-adventure stealth video game developed and published by Konami. Directed, written, and designed by Hideo Kojima (as his final work at Konami), it is the ninth installment in the Metal Gear franchise, following Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, a stand-alone prologue released the previous year. Set in 1984, nine years after the events of Ground Zeroes, the story follows mercenary leader Punished "Venom" Snake as he ventures into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and the Angola–Zaire border region to exact revenge on those who destroyed his forces and came close to killing him during the climax of Ground Zeroes.

The game is played from a third-person perspective in an open world which can be explored either on foot or by modes of transport. Snake can use a wide repertoire of weapons and items and receive assistance from several AI companions, allowing the player to combat enemies either stealthily or directly. Enemy soldiers and resources found in the world can be transported to Snake's headquarters, allowing for its expansion and the development of further technology. The game includes two separate multiplayer modes, Metal Gear Online (also known as Metal Gear Online 3) and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs); the latter mode allows players to develop FOBs, which can then be invaded by other players.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on September 1, 2015. It received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, open world, graphics, themes, and performances. Its narrative and certain changes to the series formula divided critics, while the appearance of the character Quiet drew criticism. The game's repeated missions, ending, and evidence of removed content led some to label it unfinished. The Phantom Pain shipped 6 million units by December 2015. It received several awards and is considered to be one of the greatest stealth games of all time. Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience, a bundle that includes both The Phantom Pain and Ground Zeroes, along with all additional content for both games, was released in October 2016.

Gameplay
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a stealth game in which players take the role of Punished "Venom" Snake from a third-person perspective in an open world.[1] Gameplay elements are largely unchanged from Ground Zeroes, meaning that players must stealthily traverse several areas in the game world, avoiding enemy guards and remaining undetected.[2] Included in Snake's repertoire are binoculars, a variety of weapons, explosives, and stealth-based items such as cardboard boxes and decoys.[2][3] Following one of the series traditions, The Phantom Pain encourages players to progress through the game without killing, using non-lethal weapons such as tranquilizer darts to subdue enemies.[4] Players may traverse the game world with vehicles such as jeeps and tanks, in addition to traveling on foot or on horseback, and as certain locations are mountainous,[5] players may opt to go rock climbing as a shortcut.[6] They may call for helicopter support against enemy soldiers or request airstrikes that can bombard the target area or change the weather.[7] Snake can call on one of a few AI "buddy" companions: D-Horse, a horse capable of wearing armor and hiding Snake during travel; D-Dog, a wolf pup raised to assist Snake in the field; Quiet, a mute female sniper with supernatural abilities; and D-Walker, a manned, highly agile mobile weapons platform that can provide heavy weapons support.[3][8][9] The companions' abilities and their effectiveness depends on the player's relationship with them.[7] There is a large emphasis on tactics in The Phantom Pain.[10]


In this screenshot, Snake uses the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system to transport a sheep back to Mother Base.
As in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, The Phantom Pain features a base-building system that allows players to develop weapons and items from their headquarters, Mother Base.[11] Recruitment of enemy soldiers and prisoners has returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app.[12] Unlike in Peace Walker, where players can only view Mother Base from the air, The Phantom Pain allows players to control Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, an item introduced into gameplay in Peace Walker, returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother Base.[13] An in-game currency called GMP is used for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology, and can be collected from objects found all over the map, such as rough diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes,[9] as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested in upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a missile-like drone.[14][15]

Game design direction allows the player to choose in what order the story events take place by selecting missions in any order they like, and yet still "understand the encompassing message by the end".[16][17] The enemy AI has improved in terms of situational awareness. If players frequently use particular weapons or tactics to subdue enemy soldiers, enemies will increase in number and be outfitted with better equipment; for example, frequent use of headshots will result in enemy soldiers donning metal helmets to make targeting the head harder.[18] Other actions from the player can affect the wider game world further; for example, sabotaging a radar installation will open up a new landing zone.[19]

The game has a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle that runs in real-time.[20] The cycle is able to be fast-forwarded when Snake lights a "Phantom Cigar", a type of electronic cigar; a digital silver Seiko watch panel appears on screen to denote time.[21] The passage of time enables players to analyze the movement of marked enemy forces in the area, such as shifts in sentry patrols and individual patrol routes. Weather conditions, such as sandstorms and rain, affect the gameplay environment by reducing visibility or masking the sound of footsteps.[22]

Multiplayer
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain includes two multiplayer modes: first, the new Metal Gear Online 3, developed by Kojima Productions' newly formed Los Angeles division (now known as Konami Los Angeles Studio).[23] The second multiplayer mode is an extension of the Mother Base base-building feature. Players are able to expand their operations to include Forward Operating Bases, which can be used to generate resources and income for the single-player campaign.[24] These facilities can be attacked by other players, making a player-versus-player mode available whereby the attacking team attempts to steal resources and/or soldiers and the defending team tries to protect the Forward Operating Base from the intruder. Defenders are able to call on their friends to aid in the defense, especially if their Forward Operating Base is attacked during a story mission.[25] Players are able to customize the security, staffing, and layout of their Forward Operating Bases, allowing for a large number of compound configurations. Following the success or failure of the intrusion, the location of the attacking player's Forward Operating Base is revealed to the defending player;[26] however, defending players can only launch a retaliatory strike if the attacker was discovered during their infiltration. The Forward Operating Base feature is a separate multiplayer experience to Metal Gear Online 3[24] and is needed to increase the number of combat units the player can deploy.

Setting
In the aftermath of the events of Ground Zeroes and the destruction of Militaires Sans Frontières (MSF), Big Boss (Kiefer Sutherland/Akio Ōtsuka) falls into a coma.[27] Nine years later, he awakens and helps lead a new mercenary group, Diamond Dogs.[28] Adopting the codename "Venom Snake", he ventures into Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War and the Angola—Zaire border region during the Angolan Civil War to track down the people responsible for MSF's destruction. Along the way, he becomes reacquainted with his former rival Ocelot (Troy Baker/Satoshi Mikami) and encounters Quiet (Stefanie Joosten), an assassin and sniper with supernatural abilities. While he and Kazuhira Miller (Robin Atkin Downes/Tomokazu Sugita) are initially driven to exact revenge, Snake unearths a plot by the Cipher organization to develop a new model of the Metal Gear system known as the ST-84 "Sahelanthropus".[29]

Characters
See also: List of characters in the Metal Gear series
In contrast to previous Metal Gear installments, Kojima Productions conducted the voice acting and motion capture with English-speaking actors and stuntmen first. While facial motion capture was used before for Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, it was done separately from the actual voice acting. The Japanese voice acting was dubbed over the English cast's performance afterward, in contrast to previous releases in the series since Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, which had the characters' vocal and facial expressions lip-synched specifically to both, Japanese and English voice acting.

At E3 2013, Konami confirmed that actor Kiefer Sutherland would provide Snake's voice and motion capture work for the game,[30][31][32] taking a role over voice actor David Hayter.[33] Kojima's reason for replacing Hayter was to "have a more subdued performance expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words", and that he "needed someone who could genuinely convey both the facial and vocal qualities of a man in his late 40s". Hollywood producer and director Avi Arad suggested to Kojima that Sutherland could fulfill his requirements.[34][35][36] Akio Ōtsuka was unaffected by this casting change and continued to voice Snake in the Japanese version.[37] On March 4, 2015, Kojima revealed that Snake would have less dialogue in The Phantom Pain than previous installments. The reasoning behind it was to make Snake come across as an extension to the player and that he "will act based on [player's actions] rather than doing things like making spontaneous comments or flirting with women."[38]

Other members of the voice cast include Troy Baker as Ocelot,[39] Jay Tavare as Code Talker,[40] James Horan as Skull Face, Robin Atkin Downes as Kazuhira Miller, Christopher Randolph as Dr. Emmerich,[41] and Piers Stubbs as Eli. The Japanese dub features Tomokazu Sugita as Miller, Hideyuki Tanaka as Emmerich, Takaya Hashi as Skull Face, Satoshi Mikami as Ocelot, Osamu Saka (whose previous roles include Sergei Gurlukovich in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater) as Code Talker,[42][43] and Yūtarō Honjō as Eli.[44] Dutch model Stefanie Joosten provides the likeness, voice and motion capture for the new character Quiet,[42] a mute sniper with supernatural abilities who may assist Snake on missions depending on the player's actions during a certain mission.[45] She provides the vocals for "Quiet's Theme".

Plot
In 1984, nine years after the destruction of MSF,[c] Big Boss awakens from a coma in a hospital on a British military base in Cyprus. Quiet, a Cipher assassin, attempts to kill him, but he is rescued by a heavily bandaged man called "Ishmael". The pair escape the hospital while evading pursuit from Cipher soldiers and two superhumans, the "Third Child" and the "Man on Fire". Big Boss loses Ishmael, but is recovered by Revolver Ocelot and brought aboard Diamond Dogs, a new mercenary group founded by Kazuhira Miller on an offshore platform near Seychelles.

Big Boss adopts the code name "Venom Snake" and begins searching for Cipher. Snake becomes involved in the Soviet–Afghan War and the Angolan Civil War. He recruits the superhuman mute sniper Quiet; scientist and MSF associate Dr. "Huey" Emmerich; and Code Talker, a Navajo expert on parasites forced to work for Cipher. Snake captures Eli, a British child believed to be a clone of Snake and the leader of several child soldiers; a DNA test confirms that Venom Snake and Eli are not genetically related.

Snake learns that Cipher's leader Zero was usurped and XOF, a rogue faction of Cipher, was responsible for destroying MSF. XOF's leader Skull Face considers Cipher's plan for world peace akin to making it culturally American, and intends to release a parasite that kills anyone who speaks English. A modified parasite gave Quiet and XOF's elite soldiers, the "Skulls", their unusual abilities. After releasing the English strain of the parasite, Skull Face plans to use the threat of the latest Metal Gear "Sahelanthropus" to make nuclear weapons desirable, believing that nuclear deterrence will attain world peace while protecting other cultures; in secret, he will retain remote control of the weapons. Skull Face refuses to use an AI for Sahelanthropus, so is dependent on the Third Child's psychic abilities.

During a test, the Third Child betrays Skull Face, having Sahelanthropus seriously wound him and crush the Man on Fire. Snake defeats Sahelanthropus and recovers two of Skull Face's three parasite vials to destroy them; the third is missing, while one of those recovered is taken by the Third Child and given to Eli. Skull Face is left to die by Snake and Miller, but Huey executes him. Sahelanthropus is brought to Mother Base. Eli, the Third Child, and the child soldiers later steal Sahelanthropus and flee. It is revealed that the Third Child's powers enthralled him to the will of the most vengeful person nearby, meaning that Sahelanthropus' attack was instigated by Eli.

A parasite epidemic occurs on base, forcing Snake to kill many of his men to contain it. To honor them, he has their cremated remains turned into diamonds to carry into battle. Huey is accused of causing the epidemic while attempting to mutate the parasites to sell as weapons. Alongside suspicion of his role in MSF's destruction and evidence that he murdered his wife Dr. Strangelove for preventing him from using their son Hal in experiments, Snake exiles him from Diamond Dogs.

Quiet disappears in Afghanistan; Code Talker reveals that Quiet was infected with the English parasite to spread it within Diamond Dogs, but her allegiances shifted and she remained silent to prevent an outbreak. Huey's mutation of the parasites convinced Quiet that she could not guarantee the group's safety. Snake finds her and helps fight off Soviet forces before they hide. Quiet is forced to speak to summon a Diamond Dogs helicopter when Snake is bitten by a venomous snake, and flees into the desert to prevent another epidemic.

It is revealed that Venom Snake is not Big Boss, but a medic caught in the explosion that injured the real Big Boss (Ishmael). During his coma, the medic was transformed via plastic surgery and hypnotherapy to serve as a body decoy while Big Boss wages a covert war. Miller and Ocelot discuss Big Boss' plans to create Outer Heaven. Ocelot remains supportive, while Miller is disgusted at the deception and vows to assist Big Boss's son David in hopes of contributing to the downfall. Venom Snake would go on to set the events of the Outer Heaven uprising in motion, resulting in his death. Big Boss would then resurface during the Zanzibar Land disturbance.

Development

A recruiting poster, based on the Lord Kitchener Wants You recruitment poster, used at GDC 2012
In February 2012, a site owned by Konami, "Development Without Borders", promoted development for a new Metal Gear title, for "The "next" MGS". The site was recruiting staff for the 2012 GDC pavilion in March, and requested applications for several positions for the latest Metal Gear Solid targeted for "high-end consoles" and a "next-gen Fox engine".[46][47] As the year went on, screenshots and videos of the newly announced Fox Engine were unveiled by the team.[48] This media demonstrated many random settings and characters, although none related to the Metal Gear series. Certain screenshots, however, were noted to feature a character who resembled the Big Boss character of Metal Gear, walking up to a Stryker AFV previously seen in Metal Gear Solid 4.[49]

Konami unveiled Ground Zeroes at a private function celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Metal Gear series on August 30, 2012. The game made its public debut two days later at the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo.[50] Kojima revealed very little detail about the project at the time other than that it was a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V,[51] and that it would be the first game to use the Fox Engine, a game engine developed by Kojima Productions.[52] In January 2013, Kojima revealed that Ground Zeroes would be the first title in the series to be subtitled in Arabic, a feature the team had planned for previous games.[53] He also confirmed that the length of the cutscenes was reduced, as he believed that long cutscenes had become outdated.[16][54]

In an interview with VG247, Kojima expressed concerns over whether or not Ground Zeroes would be released. He claimed that his aim was to target taboos and mature themes, which he considered to be "quite risky", adding that his roles as creator and producer were in conflict with one another; as creator, Kojima wanted to take the risk of exploring themes that might alienate audiences, but as producer, he had to be able to tone down the content in order to sell as many copies of the game as possible. Ultimately, the role of creator won out, and Kojima described his approach as "prioritizing creativity over sales".[55][56][57]

At the Spike Video Game Awards in December 2012, a teaser trailer for a game known as The Phantom Pain was shown, credited to a new Swedish developer known as Moby Dick Studio, and was described as being "100% gameplay". Allegedly led by Joakim Mogren, the studio's mission statement read that it aimed to "deliver an uncompromising, exciting, and touching game experience to people all around the globe."[58] After the presentation, commentators speculated that The Phantom Pain was actually a Metal Gear game, noting the protagonist's resemblance to Big Boss, graphics similar to those produced by the Fox Engine, the quote "V has come to" at the end of the trailer, and that the title Metal Gear Solid V fits in the negative space and indentations of the game's logo when using the same font.[59][60] The name "Joakim" was an anagram of "Kojima", the domain name for the studio's website had only been registered about two weeks prior to the announcement, and that several people wearing Moby Dick Studio shirts were sitting in a VIP area intended for Konami staff.[59][61] Kojima stated he was impressed by the trailer and how Mogren was inspired by Metal Gear.[62]

An actor playing a heavily bandaged Mogren appeared in an interview on the March 14, 2013 episode of GameTrailers TV; while stating that he could not reveal many details, he confirmed that more details about The Phantom Pain would be revealed at the upcoming Game Developers Conference, and showed a series of screenshots on an iPad to the show's host Geoff Keighley. After Keighley pointed out the Fox Engine logo in the screenshots, Mogren appeared nervous and the segment abruptly ended.[63]

On March 27, 2013, at GDC 2013, Kojima confirmed that his studio was behind the trailer, and announced that Metal Gear Solid V would be two separate games; Ground Zeroes would now serve as a prologue for the main game, which was officially announced as Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.[64][65] He subsequently presented a trailer for the game and showcased the Fox Engine.[66] The trailer featured the song "Not Your Kind of People" from Garbage's 2012 album of the same name.[67][68]

In an interview with GameTrailers on March 29, 2013, Kojima revealed that The Phantom Pain was initially presented as an independent game so as to assess the public and industry response to the Fox Engine, as he felt that announcing the game as part of Metal Gear Solid V would bias reactions to the engine. He stated the idea had been conceived and planned with Keighley over the course of two years and was designed to encourage social media activity from fans.[69][70]

While the official trailer announcing the game was running on a PC, the game was released for the seventh and eighth generations of video game consoles. In an interview during E3 2013, when asked about a PC release, Kojima stated: "We are making it, and it will be on par with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions."[71] However, he made it clear that the PC port was not their priority.[72] Kojima confirmed that the visuals seen in the trailer would look close to those in the final game. He also stated that he would like Metal Gear Solid V to be his final Metal Gear game, noting that unlike previous titles where he had announced that he had finished making games in the series, only to return for subsequent games, his involvement with the franchise would be over this time around. Although the trailer had Snake suffering from hallucinations in the form of a flaming whale, Kojima assured that there would be a balance in realism.[73]

At E3 2013, a fourth trailer was shown at the Microsoft press conference, demonstrating the new gameplay mechanics, as well as the cast of characters. The development of an Xbox One version was also announced at the conference.[74] The PlayStation 4 version was announced the following day when Konami uploaded the red band version of the trailer on their YouTube channel in addition to the standard green band version.[75][76]

The trailers for Metal Gear Solid V showed the game running on a PC hardware, but according to Kojima with textures and character models somewhat based on seventh generation hardware. The developers aimed to improve the technical quality for the versions released for the eighth generation of consoles.[77]

"This time, Snake won't really speak much at all. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an open world game focused on giving freedom to the player who will drive Snake's actions. Snake himself will be more of a silent protagonist similar to Mad Max in Mad Max 2. It's the characters around him who will expand the story."

Hideo Kojima[38]
Kojima alluded to the game possibly being "too big to clear", adding that the game is "200 [times larger] than Ground Zeroes".[78] He spoke about the restrictive nature of previous Metal Gear Solid titles, saying that they "set [the player] on one rail to get from point A to point B, with a certain amount of freedom between". In stark contrast, The Phantom Pain offers players new ways of traversal and sneaking methods, such as taking a helicopter to the mission area. Players are able to traverse the game world or deploy directly to landing zones that allow for different approaches. A video published after the E3 2015 convention showcased this, with the same mission played four times in a number of different ways: with the player opting for stealth, launching a direct assault via helicopter gunship, attempting to assassinate a target with a sniper rifle, and smuggling an explosive device into an enemy base by way of an unsuspecting patrol vehicle crew.[79] Weapons are unlicensed and fictional in The Phantom Pain, just as they were in Ground Zeroes.[80] It was confirmed that players who have previously played Ground Zeroes are able to import save data into The Phantom Pain and gain special perks.[81]

Kojima wanted the player to connect with Snake in The Phantom Pain. To accomplish this, the loss of Mother Base, which the player developed throughout Peace Walker, would serve as motivation for revenge for both Snake and the player. Kojima also tried making Snake more relatable to newcomers of the series by making him unaware of what happened in the nine years during which he was in a coma.[82]

At E3 2014, a fifth trailer featuring Mike Oldfield's song "Nuclear" was shown, unveiling more plot details surrounding the Diamond Dogs and Snake's antagonistic descent. It was leaked a day earlier via an accidental post from Konami's YouTube channel.[83] Alongside the new trailer, the website for Metal Gear Solid V was updated and included new information and images such as the developmental progress of the in-game map and the evolution of Snake's design across all games in the series.[84] On August 25, 2015, Kojima released a launch trailer showing "Metal Gear's Evolution and Harmony" with clips from the previous games along with the reveal of the new "Metal Gear Sahelanthropus".[85][86]

The first footage for The Phantom Pain's multiplayer was revealed in December 2014.[87][88] While originally set for launch alongside the release of the game, Metal Gear Online was postponed to October 6 for consoles and January 2016 for Windows.[89]

During development, Kojima Productions and Konami attracted criticism for their decision to include microtransactions; a system that allows players to pay for access to content in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players who may not have the time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions.[90] Further controversy emerged following the publication of an article claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a paywall,[91] which Konami refuted, saying that microtransactions acted as an accelerator rather than a paywall.[92]

Over $80 million was spent on the development of the game.[93]

Music
Main article: Discography of the Metal Gear series § Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack
The music of The Phantom Pain was produced by Harry Gregson-Williams, making it his fourth Metal Gear title, and composed by Ludvig Forssell, Justin Burnett, and Daniel James. Also featured in The Phantom Pain are collectable music tapes the player can listen to in-game, with a mixture of licensed music from the era and music from past Metal Gear titles.

Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack was released on September 2, 2015, containing 50 tracks selected from both Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. Following this on December 23, 2015, was Metal Gear Solid V Extended Soundtrack, containing 114 tracks again selected from both Metal Gear Solid V games. Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack The Lost Tapes was released on March 30, 2016, primarily consisting of tracks written by Ludvig Forssell for the in-game cassette tapes. The latter two releases also include music that went unused in the game, with Metal Gear Solid V Extended Soundtrack in particular containing two tracks from the cut "Mission 51: Kingdom of the Flies".

The game's soundtrack later won the award for Best Score/Soundtrack at The Game Awards 2015.[94] The event had Stefanie Joosten, Quiet's voice actress, on stage performing "Quiet's Theme".

Konami–Kojima dispute
Further information: Kojima Productions
In March 2015, Konami announced plans for a corporate restructuring that saw them part ways with Hideo Kojima and his development studio Kojima Productions. As part of the separation, Kojima's name was removed from the game cover, all of its associated paraphernalia, and future releases of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.[95][d] A Konami spokesperson stated that Kojima would still be involved with Konami and the Metal Gear franchise,[88] and despite the dispute, the company expressed confidence that the game would be declared Game of the Year.[96]

In July 2015, series composer Rika Muranaka told Fragged Nation in an interview that over 30 commissioned songs for the series were never used, with Muranaka believing that Kojima had a lack of business sense that played a part in his split from Konami.[97]

Release

Promotion at Gamescom 2015
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was released in different editions. Special Day One editions of the game for each platform featured downloadable content (DLC) vouchers for special weapons and Metal Gear Online experience points. The North American Collector's Edition (which was available for PS4 and Xbox One) comes with a steelbook and a small-size replica of Snake's bionic arm; the Premium Package for the Japanese release (which was available for PS4, PS3, and Xbox One) features a full-size replica, which was also sold separately in May 2016.[98] Sony released a PlayStation 4 bundle with the unit painted in the colors of the arm.

The physical PC release of The Phantom Pain only includes a CD key and a disc with a Steam installer contained within. Game files are not included on-disc and must be downloaded.[99][100]

Tie-in products were released for the game. Sony Mobile Communications released special edition Walkman, Xperia Z4, Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, and Xperia J Compact devices, each featuring Outer Heaven emblems, soundtrack audio, and wallpapers.[101] Watch manufacturer Seiko released a digital watch resembling Venom Snake's watch from the game. Eyeglass maker JF Rey produced themed eyewear patterned after what Kaz and Ocelot wear in the game. Japanese toy company Sentinel, which previously made an iDroid casing for the iPhone 5 and 5S, produced a transformable figure of the Sahelanthropus,[102] while Kotobukiya readied a 1/100 scale kit of the unit. Sports apparel company Puma joined the project through a line of sports jackets, T-shirts, and footwear, including Snake's sneaking boots.[103][104]

Square Enix's PlayArts Kai figure line featured several of the game's characters, while Kaiyodo produced Venom Snake and a Soviet Army soldier for the RevoMini figure category. A Japanese language novelization of The Phantom Pain was written by author Kenji Yano (under the pen name Hitori Nojima) and published by Kadokawa Shoten in bunkobon and e-book formats on October 25, 2015, following the author's two-part novelization of the original Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty published the prior two months.[105] An art book, titled The Art of Metal Gear Solid V, was published by Dark Horse Comics on November 2, 2016.[106]

A complete edition of the game, titled Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience,[e] was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam on October 11 in North America, October 13 in Europe, and November 10 in Japan. The bundle includes the Ground Zeroes prologue and The Phantom Pain in one package, along with all previously released downloadable content for both games.[107]

Removed content
The Collector's Edition of the game includes a supplemental disc containing a video for an unused in-game mission titled "Episode 51: Kingdom of the Flies", depicting the events of the mission through unfinished cinematics and concept artwork.[108][109][110][111] Taking place after the end of the campaign, it sees Snake locating and confronting Eli and the stolen Sahelanthropus on a remote island.[111][112][113] The official story ending was criticized for feeling abrupt,[111][112][113][114][115] and critics felt that Episode 51 would have given the game a more satisfying conclusion, due to it resolving several plot threads.[108][109][110][111] Others also thought it allowed certain characters further development that tied into their previous appearances in the series.[112][113][116]

Some critics found fault with The Phantom Pain's structure. The requirement of replaying missions during its second half to progress resulted in theories that they had been used in place of original content that had not been incorporated due to time constraints.[117][118] This was supported by further evidence of removed content: shortly after the discovery of Episode 51, Facepunch forum users who had been extracting data from the game's PC version found evidence of another story chapter that was not included in the final version.[118][119] The game's producer Kenichiro Imaizumi refused to comment on fans' enquiries,[120] while Metal Gear Solid community manager Robert Allen Peeler refuted the possibility of story downloadable content.[121] Some fans theorized a link between Chapter 3 and Konami's "Nuclear Disarmament Event", which was opened shortly after launch with the goal of revealing a secret in the game once all in-game nuclear weapons manufactured by players were disposed of;[122][123] a cutscene linked with the event had been discovered by data miners some days after the game's release.[124][125] Peeler did not deny that further events may occur once the disarmament had concluded, but stated that "the simplest answer is... the correct one, no need to overthink it."[122][126] On February 2, 2018, the completion of the Nuclear Disarmament Event was triggered prematurely on the Steam version of the game, despite there being over 9000 player nukes in existence at the time, resulting in the release of the aforementioned cutscene.[127] After investigation, Konami announced that this was the result of a technical error owing to the game's servers being sent incorrect values.[128] Similarly, the event would apparently go on to be achieved by players of the PlayStation 3 version of the game on July 27, 2020,[129] although in October 2020 Konami clarified this had been the work of a cheater.[130]

Critics attributed the missing content to the disclosed tensions between Konami and Kojima during development. The general consensus was that Konami had given deadlines for the game's release, owing to Kojima's increasing spending on development.[131] Data miners uncovered other examples of content that had not been included in the game, ranging from gameplay features to audio files.[117][119][132][133][unreliable source][134] Jorge Jimenez of PC Gamer wrote it was possible that content had been cut for other expected reasons.[112] Due to the perceived narrative flaws and evidence of removed story content, the game was labeled by critics as being unfinished.[135] Conversely, GamesRadar+'s Dan Dawkins argued that what fans saw as being unfinished could have been deliberate on Kojima's part, and wrote that claims of the game being incomplete were neither right nor wrong.[136] Speaking to IGN, Kojima stated that the new intellectual property he was developing since leaving Konami (later revealed as Death Stranding) would be "a complete game".[137] After the announcement of Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience in 2016, which would include all previously released downloadable content, several fans voiced their concerns via Twitter about the missing content, particularly with regards to Episode 51. Konami responded that Episode 51 had been removed in the early development stages of the game as it had not been intended to be a pivotal story ending, and that there were no plans to have the mission available to play.[138] In 2021, PC Gamer's Jorge Jimenez and Collider's Ernesto Valenzuela expressed the desire for a director's cut of the game with the removed content, though feeling that the possibility of one would be very unlikely.[111][112]

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[139][140][141] Reviewers considered it to be one of the best Metal Gear games,[161] and it has been cited as one of the greatest stealth games ever made.[162] Rich Stanton of Eurogamer wrote that "every hand-polished element slots together into a head-spinningly ambitious structure and they combine into something you can only call visionary."[144] IGN's Vince Ingenito felt they had never expected a game to exist "where every minute gameplay detail has true purpose",[151] and Spencer Campbell of EGM described The Phantom Pain as "changing the idea of what can be accomplished with an open world game, both narratively and mechanically."[143] GameSpot's Peter Brown wrote that there had never been a Metal Gear game "so consistent in tone, daring in subject matter, and so captivating in presentation [...] with such depth to its gameplay, or so much volume in content."[149] The Phantom Pain was the twenty-third game—and the third in the Metal Gear series—to receive a perfect 40/40 review rating from Japanese magazine Famitsu.[163]

Critics lauded the gameplay systems and mechanics, controls, and open world design.[3][149][154][164] GameSpot's Brown wrote that playing was an "engrossing and varied experience", calling the gameplay "near-impeccable" and discoverable scenarios "the third pillar" of the world design.[149] Stanton of Eurogamer commended how the open world felt alive through "density and intimacy" over scale, making tasks like crossing a guarded bridge "thrilling".[144] Writing for Time, Matt Peckham described the world as an "unparalleled tactical toybox", a sentiment echoed by other critics;[160] Game Informer's Joe Juba likened each mission to a playground that encouraged players to experiment with tools.[148] Destructoid's Chris Carter noted the "hundreds" of loadout variations to confront scenarios in "completely different ways".[142] Some praised the artificial intelligence of enemies, and how their tactics changed to combat the player's favored playstyles.[3][144][153][160] David Roberts of GamesRadar+ felt that the game's handling of its systems respected the player's intelligence during mistakes.[109] Conversely, USgamer's Kat Bailey wrote that the game was sometimes too unforgiving in its room for error.[154] The action set pieces were praised as "exhilarating" by PC Gamer's Jorge Jimenez,[3] and "terrifying" for their consequences by Eurogamer's Stanton,[144] though some voiced frustration at encounters with the Skulls.[3][153][154][164] Campbell of EGM noted that attacks on the player's Forward Operating Bases could distract from completing concurrent story missions.[143] Time's Peckham found the requirements to unlock the fast travel system excessive.[160]

The narrative divided critics. EGM's Campbell praised it as "one of the strongest yet" in the Metal Gear series, writing some of the game's final moments were exceptionally moving.[143] Polygon's McWhertor described it as "captivating" but often "a bit messy".[153] Brown of GameSpot was similarly captivated by the story and characters, and lauded the tonal consistency and handling of mature themes.[149] Other critics echoed praise of the latter aspect;[143][148] Eurogamer's Stanton commended how the theme of war was used to explore subject matter, contrasting with other game series "in thrall to the military".[144] Conversely, IGN's Ingenito felt the subject matter was only acknowledged, while plot-related questions were answered in a "rushed and unsatisfying" way.[151] Roberts of GamesRadar+ described the narrative as being uneventful between brief periods of exposition, and criticized the game's handling of its villains.[109] Jimenez of PC Gamer called the story "aimless" and the worst in the series, due in part for its "mostly dry" script and the opening and ending sequence for feeling extraneous.[165] Jason Schreier of Kotaku considered the story "damn unfulfilling" and incomplete, criticizing its pacing, dialogue, and characterization.[164] Reviewers disapproved of the requirement that missions were replayed on higher difficulty settings to unlock the final missions;[142][149] some felt that it added unnecessary padding to the most emotional section of the plot.[109][164]

PC Gamer's Jimenez found the ending twist that the player character is not Big Boss as "one perfect moment in a bad story". He felt that by removing their identity, the epilogue became "a perfect thematic match" for the game by reflecting the player's own gameplay experience.[165] Carter of Destructoid wrote that the series had always "dabbled in the concept of "the legend" being stronger than the actual person".[166] GamesRadar+'s Roberts called a player-created avatar for Big Boss as "purely and distinctly Metal Gear", but felt that the reveal lacked closure and caused the story to feel "hollow" because of the "slapped in" ending and repeated missions.[109] Kotaku's Schreier thought that experiencing a character arc that was not Big Boss' cheapened the rationale for the player's actions, and that the story failed to explain how Venom Snake and Big Boss would become villains.[114]

Many noted changes to typical conventions of the series.[167] USgamer's Bailey felt it was the right approach that risks were taken to distance The Phantom Pain from the usual Metal Gear formula.[154] Jimenez of PC Gamer described the boss fights as being "pretty dull" to previous installments, but appreciated the lack of an "overbearing mythos" in the story;[3] Polygon's Michael McWhertor and Eurogamer's Stanton praised the shorter length of the cutscenes.[144][153] Conversely, Ingenito of IGN felt they would have preferred excessive cutscenes and emotional moments that they thought Guns of the Patriots had suffered from.[151] Some criticized the choice to include story information in optional audio logs, noting it left certain plot points without necessary context.[143][148][165] Others commented on the game's more serious tone;[3][109][142][144][164] Roberts of GamesRadar+ wrote that the "brilliantly horrifying and bizarre-even-by-Metal-Gear-standards" prologue establishes an "equally harrowing plot".[109] PC Gamer's Jimenez was disappointed in the tone and reduced humour, and that the story felt non-canonical as a result.[165] The voice acting received particular praise,[109][142][148][149][151] with Eurogamer's Stanton commending the cast as "a leap" over the game's predecessors.[144] Some expressed bemusement at Venom Snake's minimal dialogue;[109][153] Kotaku's Schreier and IGN's Ingenito wrote that his silence during emotional cutscenes was "jarring", the latter feeling it went beyond "mere stoicism".[151][164]

Carter of Destructoid praised the power of the Fox Engine, calling the graphical rendering "beautiful" and the sound design "impeccable".[142] Schreier of Kotaku lauded the game as being "exceptionally polished" and looking "phenomenal", praising Snake's character model and animations.[164] USgamer's Bailey similarly wrote that D-Dog "exhibits almost Pixar-like levels of detail" in his movement and interactions.[154] GameSpot's Brown and IGN's Ingenito described the cinematography as "top-notch" and "beautiful", respectively.[149][151] Juba of Game Informer felt that the visuals were "great", though noted some occasional texture pop-in.[148] Critics praised the game's performance as "smooth" in spite of its high graphical fidelity.[148][164][142]

Portrayal of Quiet
Main article: Quiet (Metal Gear)
Before the release of the game, the presentation of the female character Quiet became a topic of controversy concerning her appearance. Halo content producer David Ellis criticized her for being oversexualized and a negative affirmation of the stereotype of the game industry as "full of man babies".[168][169][170] Kojima and Konami released Quiet figurines in May 2015 as part of the game's promotion. The figure's soft, pliable breasts were criticized by some in the West in social media and in the press.[171][172][173]

The finished game drew more criticism of Quiet's portrayal in both reviews and opinion pieces.[174][175] Michael McWhertor of Polygon described the justification for Quiet's lack of clothing as "inextricably tied to the game's convoluted story", and criticized how the game similarly presented other female characters by "zeroing in on their jiggling breasts and panning across their asses in a silly, oversexualized way."[153] GamesRadar+'s David Roberts described Quiet as "one of the most complex and conflicted characters in MGS5", but that her depiction was an example of a "juvenile approach to sexuality" that typifies Kojima's work and the Metal Gear series as a whole.[176] IGN's Ingenito called Quiet the most interesting character in the game, writing that her "warm, childlike sincerity and battlefield ferocity cause her to steal every scene she's in." However, he felt disappointed that she was also "required to be a lust-object."[151]

Conversely, GameZone's James Wynne felt that the game's story explanation was a valid enough reason for her scantily-clad appearance and succeeds in Kojima's aim to make Quiet "a true antithesis to sexy-just-because female characters." He also wrote that "Fan service doesn't erase the fact that Quiet is a strong, well-written character that doesn't need a man to save her. That puts her on a level comparable to The Boss, who was the most impressive female character to ever grace a video game."[177]

Sales
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain shipped 3 million physical copies within its first five days of release, across all platforms.[178] On its release date, the game grossed US$179 million, higher than the combined opening day box office of the films Avengers: Age of Ultron and Jurassic World.[179] The Phantom Pain debuted at number one on the United Kingdom charts. It became the third biggest video game launch of 2015 in the UK, behind Batman: Arkham Knight and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.[180] The Phantom Pain was the most successful launch for the series in the UK, beating the previous record holder, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, by 37 percent.[180] The game sold 411,199 physical retail copies on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 within the first week of release in Japan, topping the Japanese software sales charts that week.[181]

In the United Kingdom, the game sold noticeably more on the PlayStation family of consoles than the Xbox. Excluding computer sales, The Phantom Pain moved approximately 72 percent of copies on PlayStation 4, roughly three times the amount sold on the Xbox One, which accounted for 22 percent of sales. three percent of sales were on PlayStation 3, and two percent on Xbox 360.[182] By the end of September 2015, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain had shipped over five million copies worldwide,[183] which had raised to over six million by December 2015.[184]

Awards
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was awarded Game of the Year from several publications, including PC Gamer,[185] Game Revolution,[186] GamesRadar+,[187] and Entertainment Weekly.[188]

Cliché Audit: METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN (2015)

NOTE: This audit only covers low- and medium-risk clichés from the master list.

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING CLICHÉS

  A. The Mute Badass (LOW)
     - Quiet embodies the silent sniper trope with supernatural combat ability and no spoken dialogue for most of the game.
     - Though her silence is later justified by narrative logic (language parasite), the trope’s surface-level deployment feeds into visual fetishism.
     - Her emotional vulnerability and sacrifice add nuance, but much of the audience focus remains on her body rather than her arc.

  B. Reluctant Father Figure (LOW)
     - Venom Snake's protective dynamic with Eli and the Diamond Dogs child soldiers hints at a surrogate father arc.
     - However, the game deliberately subverts sentimentality—Snake never truly connects with Eli, who remains antagonistic.
     - The trope is mostly teased but denied full emotional payoff, in keeping with Kojima’s thematic ambiguity.

  C. Amnesiac Hero (MEDIUM)
     - Venom Snake's memory loss following the coma positions him as an identity cipher.
     - The eventual twist—that he’s not the “real” Big Boss—leans heavily into the amnesia reveal trope.
     - While this serves meta-commentary on the player’s role, it distances the protagonist from having a distinct, individuated arc.

  D. Stoic Protagonist Surrounded by Expressive Side Characters (LOW)
     - Snake’s minimal dialogue is contrasted with Miller’s rage, Ocelot’s wit, and Huey’s cowardice.
     - This dynamic emphasizes player immersion and reinforces the theme of agency transfer.
     - However, emotional resonance is often muted due to Snake’s reactive (rather than active) expression.

II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING CLICHÉS

  A. The Twist You’re the Villain (MEDIUM)
     - The final reveal that the player is not Big Boss but his body double recontextualizes the narrative.
     - This retroactive identity shift plays with player expectations but also denies a fully satisfying arc resolution.
     - The twist adds philosophical depth but at the cost of coherence and emotional closure.

  B. The Woman Dies to Save the Man (LOW)
     - Quiet sacrifices herself by breaking her silence to save Snake.
     - While motivated by personal agency, this act falls into a familiar framing where female presence is ultimately in service of the male protagonist’s survival.
     - The story attempts to justify it via plot logic but never fully counters the trope’s implications.

  C. Secret Government Conspiracy (LOW)
     - The Cipher/XOF dynamic echoes common government-overreach tropes.
     - Skull Face’s backstory and motives offer texture, but the broad strokes remain familiar to conspiracy fiction.
     - The philosophical critique of linguistic imperialism adds originality to an otherwise stock structure.

  D. Mind-Controlled Child Weapon (MEDIUM)
     - The Third Child (Psycho Mantis) manipulating others through psychic power recycles the "supernatural child" trope.
     - His motivations remain vague, and his presence largely serves plot mechanics over character development.
     - The trope is used for spectacle, not empathy.

III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING CLICHÉS

  A. Military-Grit Color Palette (LOW)
     - The game relies heavily on sepia-toned, dusty environments for Afghanistan and murky greens for Africa.
     - While grounded in realism, the aesthetic reinforces a tired visual shorthand for “war zone.”
     - Occasional lighting contrast (Mother Base, cutscenes) helps break monotony.

  B. Dream/Hallucination Sequences (MEDIUM)
     - Frequent hallucinations (the hospital intro, post-trauma visions) play into the “is this real?” trope.
     - The opening sequence intentionally blurs reality, but later uses diminish in effectiveness.
     - The repetition risks undermining suspense through overuse.

IV. ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS CLICHÉS

  A. Chapter-Based Structure With Padded Second Half (MEDIUM)
     - Chapter 2 recycles prior missions with new parameters, creating a sense of filler.
     - The reused content masks the absence of a proper Act 3, a structure criticized as incomplete.
     - Common in games where budget or production problems interfere with narrative delivery.

  B. Optional Audio Logs Holding Key Story (LOW)
     - Crucial character motivations and thematic beats are locked behind cassette tapes.
     - While immersive for players who explore, this practice alienates casual players from understanding the full narrative arc.
     - It’s a common design workaround that risks compromising emotional cohesion.

  C. Final Boss Fight Feels Tacked On or Diminished (MEDIUM)
     - There is no traditional climactic boss battle with a named antagonist.
     - Sahelanthropus fight occurs midway; Skull Face dies offscreen; Eli’s arc is unresolved due to cut content.
     - Players often felt robbed of emotional catharsis or mechanical payoff.

---
Total Medium-Risk Tropes: 6  
Total Low-Risk Tropes: 8  
No High-Risk Tropes Detected

Cumulative Risk Profile:  
- Structural risk: MEDIUM (missing ending, twist identity, reused missions)  
- Thematic risk: LOW (most tropes modified or complicated through meta-design)  
- Visual/cinematic risk: LOW (military grit and dream logic used with intent but little novelty)

Verdict: *Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain* subverts or reframes most of its clichés, but a few—especially structural and identity-based—pose medium narrative risks. Kojima’s experimental approach justifies some trope usage, though reliance on ambiguity and withheld resolution leaves an uneven impression.

Prey is a 2017 first-person shooter immersive sim video game developed by Arkane Austin and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on May 5, 2017.

Prey takes place in an alternate timeline in which an accelerated Space Race resulted in mankind taking to orbital stations far earlier. The player controls Morgan Yu while exploring the space station Talos I, in orbit around Earth–Moon L2, where they were part of a scientific team researching the Typhon, a hostile alien force composed of many forms with both physical and psychic powers, such as shapeshifting into a clone of any inanimate object. As the Typhon escape confinement, the player uses a variety of weapons and abilities, some of which are derived from the Typhon themselves, to survive while progressing to end the alien outbreak on the station and ultimately escape. The player gradually gains access to areas of Talos I through linear mission progression - acquiring key items and abilities along the way - eventually allowing the player to explore the station in an open world setting. The game combines elements of first-person shooters, role-playing video games, stealth games, and Metroidvanias in its design.

Arkane's Prey is largely unrelated to the 2006 game Prey developed by Human Head Studios. While Prey 2, a sequel to the 2006 game, had been planned by Human Head, it fell into development hell following the transfer of the intellectual property from 3D Realms to Bethesda Softworks, and was eventually canceled in 2014. Arkane's game does not use any of the planned sequel's assets and only incorporates the previous game's name and the broad theme of the protagonist being hunted by aliens. Arkane built Prey as a spiritual successor to System Shock, giving players multiple avenues to approach and tackle missions while considering the Talos I station a thematic reinterpretation of the underground dungeon from their debut game, Arx Fatalis.

Prey received positive reviews from critics and is considered one of the best games of 2017 by several gaming magazines and websites. Two expansions were released: Mooncrash, a procedurally-generated mode inspired by various roguelike games, and a multiplayer Typhon Hunter that incorporates the Typhon shapeshifting abilities in a hide-and-seek style game. Retrospectively, the game has been recognized by several gaming publications as one of the best immersive sims released to date.

Gameplay

Players can use the gloo cannon to freeze Mimics, stopping them from moving and transforming into daily life objects.
Prey is a first-person shooter[1] immersive sim with role-playing and stealth elements set in an open world environment.[2] The player takes the role of Morgan Yu, a human aboard a space station overrun by the Typhon, a hostile alien race with various differing subspecies. In a play through, Players can customize Morgan’s attributes, such as gender, and make choices that may, or may not, ultimately influence the story. To survive, the player must collect and use weapons, tools, and resources aboard the station to fend off and defeat the Typhon threat.[3] For example, Recycler Charges can be used to break down almost any object into raw materials, which can then be repurposed using the game's crafting system.[4] The game also features a variation of the skill tree system, enabling players to tailor their playstyle to suit their preferences.[4] In the game, skill points are obtained through an item called a Neuromod. These items can be discovered in the game world and, later on, crafted by the player. Neuromods enable the player to unlock a range of abilities like hacking and repairing. [5]

According to creative director Raphaël Colantonio, the station setting of Talos I is completely continuous rather than having separate levels or missions, at times requiring the player to return to areas they previously explored. Lacking a conventional fast travel system, the player can instead venture outside Talos I into space and find shortcuts connecting parts of the station.[6] Colantonio stated that the Typhon aliens have an array of different physical and psychic powers that the player character can gain over time; one such alien, for example, can shapeshift into everyday items, such as a chair or coffee mug.[6] The player can acquire the aliens' abilities by using a device called a psychoscope, which is found through mission progression.

Prey has multiple endings, according to lead designer Ricardo Bare; the endings fall into three major narrative structures depending on how the player broadly interacted with the station and surviving humans, but Bare said there are "tons of little permutations" based on specific events.[7]

Mooncrash expansion
The Mooncrash expansion, released in June 2018, is a separate game mode built atop the setting and gameplay of the base Prey game. It is a roguelike experience[8][9][10] in which, while the levels of the expansion remain the same,[9][10] the placement of enemies, weapons, and other items are randomized on each playthrough.[10]

Narratively, the player takes the role of Peter, a hacker aboard a satellite orbiting the Moon, forced by his employer the Kasma Corporation to figure out what happened at the Pytheas Moonbase. Peter does this by running through simulations, in which he takes the place of one of five known survivors of the attack. The player must figure out how each of the five survived through the five various escape routes. This is presented by leading one character through the station, fighting off the Typhon, collecting equipment, hacking terminals, and other actions. If the player can lead that character to safety, they then must lead the other characters, one at a time, through the same game world to find a different escape point, with all of the changes from the previous characters still in place. Players may reset the simulation, randomizing the world elements[10] and effectively starting a new run. However, the player gains points[9] that they can use within the simulation to improve how any of the characters start, such as with better weapons or additional health packs, and they can permanently unlock skills for each character within future simulation runs by collecting certain objects.[11]

Typhon Hunter expansion
The Typhon Hunter expansion contains two game modes. One is designed as a single-player virtual reality experience known as Transtar VR,[12] challenging the player to various escape room scenarios aboard the Talos I station.[13] The second is an asymmetrical multiplayer mode for up to six players.[14] One plays as Morgan while the others are Mimic Typhons, which can disguise themselves as nearly any object within the environment.[12] The player as Morgan is challenged to find and kill all the other players within a limited amount of time, while the Mimic players can rearrange items in rooms, disguise themselves, and when the Morgan player is close, jump out and attack them before seeking another hiding place.[15]

Plot
Setting
Prey takes place in an alternate timeline where in 1958 the Soviet Union encounters a species of eusocial aliens, called the Typhon, aboard their satellite Vorona 1. The Soviet Union works together with the United States to fight off and capture the aliens, unbeknownst to the general population. Together, they build the space station Kletka[a] to be used as a prison for the Typhon situated in orbit around the Moon. After a failed assassination attempt on United States President John F. Kennedy, the United States wrests full control of the Kletka satellite from the Soviet Union. Research of the Typhon continues under the name "Project Axiom". After the "Pobeg Incident" in 1980 where some scientists aboard the station lost their lives to the Typhon, the American government shutters Project Axiom, leaving the captive Typhon alive.

By 2025, the newly-founded TranStar Corporation acquires Kletka and by 2030, has refitted it as Talos I, a fully operational research laboratory to study the Typhon and develop advances in neuroscience; this leads to the creation of neuromods that harness the Typhon's physiology to restructure the human brain to grant the user new abilities, including superhuman ones.[16] TranStar grows financially successful from sales of neuromods on Earth. At the time of the setting, about 2035, TranStar has further expanded the station to make for suitable living quarters for its staff that spend up to two years on the station between regular shuttles to Earth.[17]

Because of the numerous agencies that operated and expanded Talos I over the decades, the station includes a large mix of architectural designs, ranging from retrofuturism that was popular in 1960s America, to brutalist styles that were common in the Soviet Bloc in the mid-20th century, to opulent Art Deco put in place by the wealthy TranStar executives.[18][19]

Synopsis
In March 2032, Morgan Yu (male voiced by Tim Kang, female voiced by Sumalee Montano)[20] is recruited by their brother Alex (Benedict Wong)[20] to join TranStar's research team on Talos I. Before leaving for the station, Morgan takes a series of tests including the Trolley problem and the Rorschach test. One of the supervising doctors is attacked by a Typhon during the testing process, and Morgan is knocked out. Morgan wakes up in their apartment and finds that it is a simulated environment. It is 2035 and Morgan has been living on Talos I for three years. Morgan is contacted by January (voiced by Kang or Montano, depending on the player's chosen gender),[20] an Operator artificial intelligence that claims to have been built by Morgan. January warns Morgan that the Typhon have broken containment and taken over the station, killing the majority of the crew. It reveals to Morgan that they had been testing neuromods for the past three years, with Morgan continually adding and removing them. While these neuromods allow for instantaneous learning of complex skills and abilities, a side effect of removing a neuromod is that the user loses all memories gained after installation of that neuromod, explaining Morgan's memory loss. January claims that Morgan built it to help destroy Talos I, taking the Typhon and all of its research with it. Alex contacts Morgan and suggests instead building a special Nullwave device that will destroy the Typhon but leave the station intact, citing how their research is too valuable to lose.

Morgan travels through the station and encounters other survivors, with a choice of whether to help them or not. Alex tasks Morgan with scanning the Typhon "Coral" growing around the station and discovers that the Typhon are building some sort of neural network. Their attempts to study the neural network are interrupted when the TranStar Board of Directors learns of the containment breach and sends a cleanup crew to eliminate both the Typhon and any surviving station crew. After the cleanup crew is dealt with, Alex further analyzes the data and concludes that the Typhon are sending a signal into deep space to summon something. A gargantuan Typhon called the Apex appears and begins to devour Talos I. Morgan is given the choice of to activate the station's self-destruct sequence or build the Nullwave device to defeat the Typhon.

If Morgan chooses to activate the Nullwave device, all of the Typhon on Talos I are destroyed and the station is left intact. If Morgan chooses to activate the self-destruct, the entire station explodes, destroying all of the Typhon with it. Morgan either finds a way to escape the station or is stranded and dies in the explosion, based on earlier choices in the game.

In a post-credits scene, Morgan wakes up in a lab and learns that it is not the real Morgan, but instead, a captured Typhon implanted with Morgan's memories in an effort to teach it human emotions and empathy. The Typhon have invaded Earth; Alex and his Operator assistants judge "Morgan" based on the choices it made throughout the game. If "Morgan" failed to show human empathy, Alex destroys it and starts the experiment over. If "Morgan" did show human empathy, Alex lets it go, whereupon it can choose to accept his offer to bring peace between the Typhon and humanity or kill him.

Mooncrash
In 2036, Peter is stationed in a remote satellite orbiting the Moon and is forced under contract by the Kasma Corporation, a rival to TranStar, to undergo numerous simulations reliving a Typhon outbreak on Transtar's Pytheas Moon Base. As he completes his assigned tasks, his handler Basilisk warns him that Kasma will betray him once his mission is complete and helps him make preparations to escape. When Peter fulfills his contract, Kasma congratulates him but claims that due to tight budgets, they cannot retrieve him from the satellite and shut off its life support. With help from Basilisk, Peter overrides the satellite's controls and crashes it near the real Pytheas facility, where he commandeers a shuttle and returns to Earth. In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that a Mimic has stowed away on Peter's shuttle.

Development
Intellectual property transition
See also: Prey 2
The success of the original Prey led to the announcement of a sequel Prey 2 in August 2006, with continued development by 3D Realms.[21] However, the project faced numerous issues, including the transfer of the intellectual property (IP) rights to Bethesda Softworks (under ZeniMax Media) by 2011. In March 2011, Bethesda announced that Prey 2 would instead be developed by Human Head Studios using a modified id Tech 4 engine.[22][23]

On May 31, 2013, Kotaku reported rumors that development had moved to Arkane Studios and that the development had been rebooted, scrapping all of Human Head Studios' work on Prey 2 with a targeted release of 2016.[24] After about a year of further rumors, Bethesda cancelled Prey 2. Arkane had started working on a Prey game that would be considered a reboot rather than a sequel, using none of the Prey concepts and none of Human Head's previous development.[25]

Announcement and controversy
On June 12, 2016, Bethesda announced the Prey reboot at its E3 press conference. Development was led by Arkane Studios CEO and director Raphaël Colantonio and his team in Austin, Texas.[26] The new Prey is not a true sequel but instead "a re-imagining of the IP", according to Colantonio.[27] The teaser trailer shown during E3 2016 showed the protagonist in something like "a space horror version of Groundhog Day", according to CNET's Seamus Byrne.[28] Bethesda's vice president of marketing Pete Hines explained that the new game has no elements from the cancelled Prey 2 outside of the player facing aliens.[29]

Colantonio said in later interviews that calling their game Prey was a "non negotiable compromise" with Bethesda, a decision that no one on the Arkane team was pleased with. Colantonio described the naming decision as "gross" and "disrespectful" to both his team and the creators of the original game.[30] He stated that it felt like a "kick in the face" to the developers of the original game (Human Head Studios) and that he wished to apologise to them.[31] The creative team at Arkane reportedly wanted their game to stand on its own as a unique IP but were overruled by corporate decisions at Bethesda. [32] Colantonio said it felt bad to lie that they were continuing the Prey series.[33] He expressed that it was a "sales mistake" that would turn away fans of the original Prey and fail to attract other players.[34] Colantonio left Arkane Studios shortly after Prey's release, citing creative disagreements as one of his reasons for departing. [35]

Gameplay design
Prey came out of Arkane Studios' own ideas; as explained by Colantonio, they split their team to work on two projects after completing work on Dishonored. One project was Dishonored 2 and the other was a new intellectual property based on similar gameplay ideas which would be "in first-person, with depth and simulation and narration".[25] According to lead designer Ricardo Bare, Colantonio had suggested they look back towards what they had done with Arx Fatalis, a fantasy title produced by Arkane in 2002 which featured "this big, inter-connected dungeon that the player could roam so long as they could unlock everything".[36] They took this "mega-dungeon" concept, but set it as a space station filled with hostile aliens, and would require the player to consider the "full ecology" of the game world to overcome obstacles.[25][18] They did not want the player to solve singular-solution puzzles, such as simply finding a key for a locked door, but instead "think of this as a living, dynamic world, where there are tons of solutions possible", according to Bare.[18]

As Arkane started developing this concept, they recognized the similarities to the original Prey. Realizing that coming up with a name for a new property can be difficult and that through Bethesda that they would have the ability to use that name, they chose the name Prey.[25] Hines explained that Arkane evaluated the Prey property to its core and built up a new game around it, calling it more a psychological game rather than a horror one.[29] In a 2021 making-of documentary created by Noclip, Colantonio and Bare said that, while the project never had any other official name, the title Prey was a direct mandate from Bethesda. Colantonio referred to it as a "compromise" for the team's creative freedom, saying that the game "had to be Prey somehow" and that the name "was not necessarily [...] the best choice we wanted back then", while Bare recalled that "The Bethesda group was like, 'we have this name Prey, can you please use it?'"[37]

According to design documents from early in the project's history published by Kotaku, the game was developed at Arkane under the name "Project Danielle".[38] This was later confirmed by Bare, who added that the name was "a little bit of an homage to SHODAN" from System Shock.[39] Three different concepts were presented, all based on the nature of System Shock and involving the player-character named Danielle Sho to find that there was a false reality in their apparent world and dealing with an artificial intelligence that has a significant influence on events; these settings included a futuristic lab set on Earth set just prior to the System Shock time frame, a secret lab on a remote island, and a retro-futuristic setting. Kotaku observed that this final setting was closest to what the released Prey looked like.[38]

Prey incorporates numerous gameplay concepts from Dishonored, which was itself inspired by the Looking Glass Studios' games Thief: The Dark Project and System Shock, where players are encouraged to find creative solutions to overcome obstacles.[40] Borrowed elements from Dishonored include giving the player enough agency to determine how they want to proceed, having in-game consequences for certain actions taken by the player, developing a game world based on pre-established lore that can be learned by examining notes and computer terminals throughout the station, and a simple user interface.[40] However, Colantonio said that Prey would be less focused on stealth as Dishonored was, and would provide a more role-playing video game-style improvement system through in-game chipsets that allows the player to customize their abilities for more tactical fast-paced action sequences in contrast to Dishonored's bone charm system.[40]

While Prey has been likened to a Metroidvania, Bare has said that he was not familiar with the sub-genre and that Prey's world design follows in the footsteps of games such as System Shock and Arkane's own Arx Fatalis, which featured interconnected worlds where to make progress, obstacles had been overcome through abilities the player could acquire.[41] Bare considered the Talos I setting to be "like an open world" that is fully explorable as the player gained abilities and equipment.[42] However, according to Colantonio, calling it an open world "might have the wrong associations."[43] The developers also took inspiration from FTL: Faster Than Light, considering the complexities of the various gameplay systems and how fast that a situation can go wrong if the player did not sufficiently plan. Bare said they wanted to include that "chaos of systems", and keeping in mind that Talos I is a functioning space station, populated the station with various hazards like gas pipes and oil spills that can be both an aid to the players in defeating the Typhon or a cause of unforeseen consequences if the player is not careful.[44] Arkane had considered including procedural generation within the main campaign, so that different areas may have different hazards when the player encountered them, but they recognized that this would become a point of frustration for a single-player game that may cause players to leave the game uncompleted. They dropped this approach and instead worked the procedural generation aspects into the downloadable content Mooncrash, which takes place outside the main game's campaign.[45]

Emergent gameplay was a goal of Arkane: while they had given the players abilities to take on Prey in a full action mode or full stealth mode, they wanted players to find a way to complete the game in their own manner.[36] They recognized players may take one specific set of skills and weapons and avoided including any enemies or obstacles that would be impossible to surpass because they did not specialize in the right skills, providing a means to bypass such areas.[36] Arkane restricted how many horror elements they would include, since they could not predict where the player's attention would be, providing another reason why they opted not to consider Prey a horror game.[36] Some elements supporting emergent gameplay arose during testing of the game's various systems. One of the Typhon aliens, the Mimic, was inspired by the creature of the same name from Dungeons & Dragons, and was programmed to take the form of any object smaller than itself in the room, avoiding the use of scripted events and allowing the alien's artificial intelligence to decide what to replicate.[36] Separately, one of the tools developed by Arkane was the psychoscope, which allows players to scan an alien and learn and then use its powers; when the programmers learned of this, they quickly found that having players be able to copy the Mimic's power created a depth of new gameplay options, such as taking the form of a small object to sneak into small places or taking the form of a non-flammable object to roll through fire-laden areas.[36] Enabling emergent gameplay in Prey allowed for speedrunners to take advantage of the game's tools, particularly the Gloo Cannon that can create platforms on surfaces to access areas Arkane did not intend to be accessed without other tools.[46]

Story and art

One of the points of divergence in Prey's parallel universe is the failed assassination of John F. Kennedy.
The narrative concept for Prey came to Colantonio during one of his airline flights while on travel; on return, he started to engage with the Austin studio to flesh out the ideas for the narrative, design, and gameplay, looking to build as detailed a world as they had for the city of Dunwall used as the setting for Dishonored.[47][36] Colantonio said that it took about a year from this initial concept to come up with an alternate timeline that helped support this detailing.[47] They considered how the future would have been different if John F. Kennedy survived the assassination attempt, allowing them to flesh out the narrative and design of the space station.[36] This itself directly attributed to the styles used in the various parts of the station, with the team considering what architecture would have influenced those most responsible for operating Talos I at the time. This ranged from considering what Kennedy would have seen frequently were he alive in the 1960s and 1970s, to envisioning how those funding contemporary commercial space efforts like Elon Musk or Google would style a space station.[18] As Talos I is a relatively small space, Arkane was able to detail the station in depth to make the world more cohesive, such as naming and fleshing out background stories for each non-player character (NPC), including those already dead by the story's beginning.[48]

The narrative directed them to the types of weapons that would be available to the player. Arkane recognized that as a research station, their security forces would only likely have common weapons, such as pistols and shotguns, and would not have the equivalent of super-powerful gear like Doom's BFG. What advanced weapons are available were designed to look like prototypes and have flaws associated with them being only in their testing phase.[18]


Avellone wrote and designed several parts of Prey's content.
Arkane's Harvey Smith is credited with establishing the Typhon and the reason for their existence in the story.[47] The player, as Morgan, follows in the threat's wake, finding survivors who have no idea what just happened but need their help.[42] Arkane wanted a more unique design to the aliens, and opted to use designs inspired by paranormal elements rather than stereotypical insect- or lizard-like species.[48]

Austin Grossman, also of Arkane, helped establish the early plot details with Morgan's awakening at the start.[47] Bare had reached out to Chris Avellone circa 2013 to gain his help with the story, though at the time, Avellone was committed to other projects but wanted to work with the studio. Once Avellone was able to, he contacted Arkane to offer his help on the narrative.[47] Besides other parts of the narrative, Avellone contributed to designing several NPCs and the various missions that would involve these characters. Avellone felt these characters and their missions created dilemmas for the player to determine how to proceed, helping the player to define their version of Morgan as well as expanding on the game universe.[47] Avellone worked with Arkane on the story from June to about November 2016.[49][50]

Among other works, Prey was influenced by the films Moon, Starship Troopers, and The Matrix. As part of the promotion, Bethesda partnered with the Alamo Drafthouse to show these three films during April 2017.[51] Avellone also cited Aliens as part of his inspiration, describing it as an action-suspense film which has moments of comedy, even amid heavy action sequences, and something he reused in writing for Prey.[47]

The original score was composed and produced by Mick Gordon, who had previously composed the soundtrack for Doom. Additional music was composed by Ben Crossbones, Matt Piersall, and Colantonio, with each one providing a single track. The soundtrack was released for live-streaming music services a week before the game's release.[52]

Technical development
Prior to Prey, Arkane had just released Dishonored 2 which used the studio's internally developed Void game engine. At release, many players reported performance problems with the Windows version, which Arkane fixed through patches, but led to some lingering doubts as to Arkane's ability to develop for the Windows platform. Colantonio said that Arkane wanted to remove that stigma for Prey, with the goal to produce a "really flawless" version for Windows on release.[53] The game was developed using CryEngine, an established third-party game engine, eliminating many issues related to performance. Colantonio said that they "doubled our thoroughness" in the areas of quality assurance testing to eliminate other possible issues.[53][54]

Expansions
During the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018, Bethesda announced a free update released on June 9, 2018, that added two new game modes to Prey, including a New Game Plus mode, and a Survival mode that adds modifiers, such as weapon durability, that make it more difficult. Bethesda announced the first downloadable content, Mooncrash, which is a procedurally generated adventure that was available that day. They announced plans to release a multiplayer Typhon Hunt mode, where some players play as Typhon Mimics that can disguise themselves.[55] The Typhon Hunt mode was inspired by the "Prop Hunt" mode that came about from Garry's Mod; as Arkane started to show initial details of the main game, including the Mimic enemies, players responded that they were reminded of "Prop Hunt". Bare had not been aware of what that was, but after researching it, felt it was ideal for a multiplayer extension of Prey.[15] Both Mooncrash and Typhon Hunt were modes prototyped within an internal game jam following the release of Prey, looking to see how they could easily extend the game.[15]

The Mooncrash expansion was further updated in September 2018 with a free patch that provided in-game customization skins that celebrated the team's favorite roguelike games, which included Spelunky, Rogue Legacy, Risk of Rain, Don't Starve, Darkest Dungeon, and Dead Cells.[56]

The Typhon Hunt mode was released on December 11, 2018, along with a virtual reality-based escape the room set of puzzles set before the events of Prey. Both modes were released as free additions to Mooncrash.[57]

Release and marketing
Prey was released on May 5, 2017.[58] Arkane and Bethesda provided a game demo for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles about a week before the launch, covering about the first hour of gameplay. The studio did not opt to provide a demo for Windows systems, citing that they had to choose between either the consoles or personal computer for demo release. Colantonio said that with the release through Steam, interested players can try the game for up to two hours under Steam's return policy, effectively treating this as the equivalent of a demo.[59] The Steam version eventually received a demo in August 2017, which included roughly the first hour of gameplay.[60]

Technical issues
PCGamesN reported that the Windows version of Prey lacked the technical problems of Dishonored 2, calling it "the best performing triple-A game" they had seen in several months.[61] Eurogamer's Digital Foundry found the computer version of Prey to run exceedingly well across even low-end computers, in contrast to problems it saw for Dishonored 2 at release.[62]

However, some reviewers and players found that after several hours of playing on the computer version, their saved games would become corrupted, and the game would crash when transitioning between areas once this started to occur. Restoring from older saves would eventually cause those to be corrupted as well, making the game impossible to complete.[63] A Bethesda representative said that Arkane was "working diligently on a fix" that would be released sometime that week;[63] the patch was deployed the following day.[64]

Trademark dispute
Just prior to release, No Matter Studios, the developers of an upcoming video game Prey for the Gods, announced that, due to trademark objections from ZeniMax Media, they had to change the name of their game to Praey for the Gods. ZeniMax reported that they had to defend the Prey trademark to avoid losing it in taking objection to No Matter's trademark filing.[65][66]

Prey received "generally favorable" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[67][68][69]

Critics praised the fully realized atmosphere of Talos I, with Neil Bolt of PlayStation Universe labeling it a "luxurious sci-fi playground".[80] On the other hand, combat proved polarizing. GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain found fight sequences "rewarding",[74] while IGN's Dan Stapleton considered combat Prey's "biggest weakness" partly due to periods of AI unresponsiveness.[76] Concerning the story, GameSpot found protagonist Morgan Yu's journey somewhat "thin",[74] and Trusted Reviews called the storyline "lacking".[81] Eurogamer ranked the game 12th on their list of the "Top 50 Games of 2017",[82] GamesRadar+ ranked it 11th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017,[83] and Polygon ranked it seventh on their list of the 50 best games of 2017,[84] while EGMNow ranked it ninth on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.[85] It was nominated for "Best Setting" in PC Gamer's 2017 Game of the Year Awards,[86] for "Best Xbox One Game" in Destructoid's Game of the Year Awards 2017,[87] and for "Best Shooter" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.[88]

The game was praised by several critics and journalists for having an Asian protagonist.[89][90][91][92][93]

Years after the game's release, many have started considering it an underrated masterpiece.[94][95][96][97][98] In 2021, TheGamer called Prey “one of the most underrated games ever made”. A 2024 piece by PC Gamer states that it “elevated immersive sims to a god-tier level”. Shortly after Arkane Austin's closure, Rock Paper Shotgun published an article stating that Prey is a “masterpiece that the industry didn't deserve”.[99]

Sales
Prey debuted at No. 2 on the weekly sales charts in the United Kingdom, trailing the Nintendo Switch port of Mario Kart 8.[100] These figures were considered disappointing due to a lack of competition from AAA new releases and the fact that the opening week sales were 60% down from Arkane's previous title, Dishonored 2.[101] Additionally, Bethesda's decision to hold review copies until the release date was mentioned by outlets as a factor for the weak launch.[101][102]

Prey captured the top spot in its second week of release, besting Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, a rise partially attributed to the positive reception from critics, though sales were down 32% from its debut week.[102][103] In doing so, Prey became the first Bethesda game since 2016's Doom to reach number one on the United Kingdom weekly sales charts.[104]

In Japan, Prey debuted at No. 5 on the weekly sales charts when it was released in late May with 7,105 copies sold for the PlayStation 4. The Xbox One version did not make the charts.[105]

Soma (stylized as SOMA) is a survival horror video game developed and published by Frictional Games.[1][2] The game was released on 22 September 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4,[3] and on 1 December 2017 for Xbox One.[4]

Soma takes place on an underwater remote research facility containing machinery that exhibit human characteristics such as possessing a personality and consciousness. Simon Jarrett, a fish-out-of-water protagonist, finds himself there under mysterious circumstances and embarks upon discovering its history, while trying to make sense of his predicament and potential future.[5][6]

Soma's gameplay builds on the conventions established in the previous horror titles of Frictional Games (notably, Amnesia: The Dark Descent) including an emphasis on stealthy evasion of threats, puzzle-solving, and immersion. However, in a break with this tradition, it also de-emphasizes aspects such as inventory management in favour of a tighter focus on narrative and character development. Soma received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its story, themes, atmosphere, sound design, and voice acting, but criticized its enemy design and encounters.

Gameplay
Soma is a single player survival horror video game played from a first-person perspective.[7] The player will encounter a number of creatures, each of which embody an aspect of the game's themes.[7] Throughout Soma, the player will find a large array of clues,[8] such as notes and audio tapes, which builds atmosphere and provides background to the narrative. Similar to most titles by Frictional Games, the player progresses the plot through puzzle-solving, exploration, and the use of stealth;[8] the player may die if they fail to avoid monsters, although two years after the initial release, a "Safe Mode" has been added that keeps the monsters but stops them from killing the player.[9] Continuing the trend from previous Frictional Games titles, the player is unable to obtain any weapons, meaning the only option is to attempt to outrun or hide from the monsters.[10]

Plot
Setting
Soma takes place in 2104 and is set in an underwater research facility known as PATHOS-II, a once-sophisticated research outpost located in the North Atlantic Ocean that has fallen into a state of disrepair. Originally established as a thermal mining operation in the 2060s by conglomerates Haimatsu and Carthage Industries, PATHOS-II's primary purpose shifted to space technology and the operation of the Omega Space Gun – an electromagnetic railgun designed to launch satellites and other small equipment into orbit without the cost or risks of traditional rockets. All operations and maintenance on PATHOS-II are overseen by the Warden Unit (WAU), an artificial general intelligence integrated with all computer systems in the facility.

The crew of PATHOS-II unexpectedly became the last people to exist on Earth after a major extinction event caused by a comet striking the planet. These humans survived on a day-to-day basis, attempting to fight the negative effects of their collective isolation, as well as other issues that began to pose a threat to their well-being.

Story
In 2015, Simon Jarrett survives a car accident, but sustains severe brain damage and cranial bleeding. Due to his injuries, Simon agrees to undergo an experimental brain scan. During the scan, Simon appears to black out, and regains consciousness on Site Upsilon of PATHOS-II, a seemingly abandoned geothermal power center. Exploring Upsilon, Simon makes contact with a woman named Catherine Chun, who invites him to Site Lambda and reveals that he is currently in the year 2104, one year after a comet devastated the Earth and left PATHOS-II as the final known outpost of humanity. When the communication platform Simon is in floods, he briefly blacks out and awakens to discover that he is inside a diving suit. Exploring the seabed around Site Upsilon, he manages to find a working train and uses it to travel to Site Lambda. Throughout the journey, Simon encounters robots - both hostile and passive - that believe they are human.

Arriving at Site Lambda, Simon discovers that Catherine is not human, but a brain scan of a PATHOS-II employee downloaded into a robot's storage unit. Simon later learns that he died in 2015 after his brain reconstruction treatment was a failure. His brain scan was later used as a historical template for AI reconstruction until it was uploaded into the modified corpse of another PATHOS-II employee by WAU, 89 years later. The WAU took control of the center and turned all the surviving humans into bio-mechanical mutants to fulfill its task of preserving humanity. The sole means of anything of human origin escaping Earth is the ARK, a digital black box designed by Catherine that houses a simulated world in which the brain scans of many of the PATHOS-II personnel have been preserved. Despite its completion, the ARK has not yet been sent into space. Simon agrees to aid Catherine in recovering the ARK and completing her mission.

As the ARK is kept in the Tau site at the absolute depths of the Atlantic Ocean, Simon heads toward the Theta site to retrieve a submarine named DUNBAT that can withstand the abyssal pressure. However, the WAU has preemptively tampered with the DUNBAT, forcing Simon to make his way to the Omicron site to create a new body capable of travelling through the seabed. While searching for the essential components at Site Omicron, Simon receives mental messages from a WAU-converted (but still sane) artificial intelligence specialist, Johan Ross, who begs him to destroy the WAU. After completing Simon's new body, Catherine copies his consciousness into it. Simon realizes that his old body is still conscious, forcing him to choose between euthanizing the Simon in his old body or leaving him to whatever fate befalls him.

Descending into the abyss, Simon braves the now mutated fauna of the Abyss and retrieves the ARK from Site Tau where he finds it guarded by the last fully human survivor of Pathos II and possibly the world. She asks Simon to kill her by shutting down her life support, which the player has a choice whether to oblige. Simon takes the ARK toward Site Phi, where the Omega space cannon is located. However, he is forced to take a detour through Site Alpha, where the WAU's core is located. Here, Ross reveals to Simon that the structural gel with which he created his new body was designed by Ross to poison and destroy the WAU, and that his colleagues refused to use it in time. Ross gives Simon the opportunity to eliminate the WAU, while secretly planning to kill him to prevent the WAU from adapting to Simon's immunity. Before he can do so, Ross is devoured by a mutated aquatic leviathan, from which Simon escapes by reaching the Phi site.

At the Phi site, he discovers the body of the original Catherine who was accidentally killed in a confrontation with other PATHOS-II staff who refused to launch the ARK due to fears of a potential launch failure. Catherine then copies their brain scans into the ARK at the last moment before it is launched into space, but Simon is confused as to why they are still outside the ARK despite their accomplishment. Catherine explains that it is their copies that are on the ARK; they argue about the nature and ethics of their mission until Catherine's cortex chip short-circuits from overexertion, effectively killing her. Simon is left helpless and alone in the darkness of the abyss.

In a post-credits scene, the copy of Simon uploaded to the ARK awakens and reunites with Catherine in an idyllic, simulated landscape. Meanwhile, the ARK drifts off into space and leaves the devastated Earth behind.

Development

Thomas Grip of Frictional Games presents Soma at the 2016 Game Developers Conference.
Soma was in the making since 2010,[7] beginning with the advancement of new technology for the game engine.[11] Setting the game at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean[12] was an idea decided on a "whim" by Frictional Games co-founders Thomas Grip and Jens Nilsson, which Grip said they had wanted to try for a long time.[13] At some point in development, the story of the game underwent a number of major changes before ending up at the final version that was released, with an older build released via an easter egg.[14] The storytelling was designed to rely on the player's actions rather than serve as a guide for the player to adhere to, so as to allow those who ignore exposition material, such as audio logs and notes, to follow the plot. Soma's underlying theme is consciousness, and was developed in order to explore the nature of free will and the self. The game's atmosphere was inspired by the work of Philip K. Dick, China Miéville and Greg Egan.[15]

Achieving a realistic sound to fit the mood required audio director Samuel Justice to utilise what he called "the room size system". Instead of processing sounds to make an effect possible, recordings were made of environments that complemented such needs, like the reverb of a large hall. With this system, over 2,000 footstep sounds were captured.[16][17]

In January 2025, publisher Abylight Studios announced a collaboration with developer Frictional Games to bring three of their most recent games (Soma, Amnesia: The Bunker, and Amnesia: Rebirth) to the Nintendo Switch.[18]

Marketing
A teaser trailer featuring gameplay footage of Soma was released on 11 October 2013.[1] The official website's info page displays a quote by author Philip K. Dick.[6] Another trailer of the game was released in April 2014.[13]

Two live action shorts, "Vivarium" and "Mockingbird," were shot back-to-back at LeftJet Studios in Seattle, over the course of nine days. The films were produced by Imagos Films, an independent film company based in Seattle.[19][20] Imagos Films also completed for Frictional Games a set of live action clips that were set to release in 2015 in monthly installments and would connect to the story of the upcoming game.[21] Due to production problems the release date was delayed and on 28 September, shortly after the release of the game, Frictional Games announced they had made available the first clip on their YouTube channel under the title "SOMA - Transmission #1", with seven more to follow in each coming day.[22] The live action miniseries acts as a prequel to the events of the game, albeit one which is inspired by its plot and characters rather than being strictly canonical to it.[23]

In collaboration with Frictional Games, a feature film tentatively called "DEPTH" was filmed by Imagos Films under the code name "Project Apophis".[24] The film's director is Don Thacker and clips from it were used for Soma's marketing campaign, such as the "Transmissions" webseries.[25] The film stars Trin Miller, Josh Truax, and Rachelle Henry, and was expected to release in 2016.[26][27]

Soma received "generally favorable reviews" according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[28][29][30]

Richard Wakeling from GameSpot gave the game a 9 out of 10, and praised the "engaging and thought-provoking" story, the "impressive" writing and voice acting, and the atmosphere and sound design, which together, fills the game with "dread" and provides a "chilling", "edge of your seat" feeling. However, Wakeling disliked the sections in which the player walks on the ocean floor, calling them "dull, plodding affairs" and "incredibly linear".[34] Philip Kollar of Polygon also gave the game a 9/10 and wrote: "I don't know if SOMA will scare people as much as Amnesia did, but it is without a doubt a stronger game, with better pacing, smarter writing and more powerful subject matter. This isn't a horror game about obfuscation; events aren't building to a huge, shocking twist. More than anything, it's about the process of dealing with the horror of reality."[39] Caitlin Cooke from Destructoid awarded the game a 9/10 as well. She stated "SOMA gets everything right about the survival horror genre. It’s like someone created the perfect video game mixtape -- a little bit of abandoned underwater atmosphere from BioShock, detailed environments a la Gone Home, and (of course) the frenzied monster mechanics from Amnesia. Even if you dislike non-combat-oriented games, I dare you to give it a try."[31]

Tim Turi from Game Informer awarded the game an 8.5 out of 10. He commended the sound for convincingly immersing the player in the game, as well as the "eerie" environments, the "simple", "reliable" controls, and the "intriguing" narrative. In his review for GamesRadar+, Leon Hurley wrote: "A disturbingly different take on interesting sci-fi concepts let down by a slow start ... but worth it overall." Hurley praised the "great" story, "likeable" characters, and the "interesting and unpredictable" locations. He also commended the game for its ability to pull the player through the story by providing rewarding situations, although Hurley did feel "lost" at times, as there are no distinct directions.[35] IGN's Daniel Krupa scored the game an 8.1/10 and wrote: "SOMA is a sustained exploration of an original and thought-provoking idea. The concept of artificial intelligence has been explored by lots of science fiction, so it isn’t unique in that regard, but it makes particularly intelligent use of video game conventions to present those familiar ideas in new and surprising ways."[37]

Criticism of Soma focused on the implementation and design of its enemies. While Cooke generally enjoyed the monster encounters and their "unique and frightening" designs, she felt disappointed that there were only a few different types, most of which only made one appearance in the game.[31] Turi found that the cat and mouse gameplay of stealthily evading monsters now felt "formulaic" in the genre and "required patience".[32] Wakeling wrote that while the encounters were necessary to provide adversity, he felt they were otherwise "tedious" and found himself "clambering to get back to the story."[34] Hurley wrote that the monsters lacked "threat" and "never really deliver ... they’re little more than dumb ambulatory obstacles", being overcome by the player "looping around behind them, or slipping past while they obediently investigate thrown objects."[35] Alex Avard of GamesRadar+ praised the game's "Safe Mode" update from 2017 that decreased the threat of the monsters, having felt they were originally "unwelcome interruptions to an otherwise enthralling mystery", but instead in Safe Mode gave the "high minded story the space it always needed to breathe". He wrote that the enemies' typically passive behavior and discernible forms improved the game's atmosphere and themes while allowing him to fully engage in the narrative, writing: "I’m no longer beset with frustrated paranoia or constantly distracted by my own survival instincts. Instead, my attention is entirely focused on engaging with Simon’s personal journey and learning more about the history of PATHOS-II".[41]

After ten days of release, Soma had sold 92,000 copies, exceeding the 20,000 copies made by the developer's previous game Amnesia: The Dark Descent in its first week.[42] In March 2016, Frictional Games announced that the game had sold more than 250,000 copies and that the company was close to breaking even,[43] which required them to sell 276,000 units.[42] In a blog post commemorating one year of release, Frictional Games estimated that the sales figures had exceeded 450,000 copies.[44] By March 2021, 1 million copies were sold on PC alone.[45] At the 2016 Golden Joystick Awards, Soma was nominated for three categories: Best Original Game, Best Storytelling and Best Visual Design.[46] In 2018, GamesRadar+ ranked the game 8th in their list of "the 20 best horror games of all time".[47]

 6. Last Girl Standing (Low)

Control is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by 505 Games. The game was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in August 2019, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in February 2021. Cloud-based versions for the Nintendo Switch and Amazon Luna were released in October 2020, followed by a version for Stadia in July 2021. A version for macOS was released in March 2025. Two paid downloadable expansions have been released.

Control revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, the player explores the Oldest House – the FBC's paranormal headquarters – and utilizes powerful abilities to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. The player gains abilities by finding Objects of Power, mundane objects like a rotary phone or a floppy disk imbued with energies from another dimension, that have been at the center of major paranormal events and since recovered by the FBC. In addition to Hope, voice work and live-action footage were provided by James McCaffrey, Matthew Porretta, and Martti Suosalo, while the band Poets of the Fall provided additional music.

Control is inspired by paranormal stories about the fictional SCP Foundation created by an online collaborative wiki fiction project, based on the genre of the new weird. The environments of the Oldest House are designed in the brutalist style common for many government buildings created during the Cold War era, serving as a setting to show off the game's destructive environmental systems. The core game includes many allusions to Alan Wake, Remedy's prior game with similar paranormal themes, and Control's AWE expansion is a crossover between the two series, which Remedy has said forms part of the Remedy Connected Universe. Control was among the first games released to utilize real-time ray tracing built into the hardware of newer video cards.

Upon release, Control received generally positive reviews from critics, with several gaming publications naming it among their top games of 2019. The game was nominated for numerous awards, winning several related to the game's art and design. It had sold over 4.5 million units by November 2024. A sequel, Control 2, was announced in June 2021. A separate three-player co-operative first-person shooter spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, is scheduled to release in 2025.

Gameplay

In Control, Jesse will gain various special powers such as the ability to levitate.
Control is played from a third-person perspective. Control is set within the Oldest House, a featureless Brutalist skyscraper in New York City, and the headquarters of the fictional Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), which studies Altered World Events (AWEs) and collects and studies Objects of Power from these AWEs. The Oldest House, itself a Place of Power, has an interior far larger than its exterior; an enormous, constantly shifting supernatural realm that defies the laws of spacetime.[1] At the onset of the game, an entity called the Hiss is attempting to cross over through a dimensional barrier into this reality and has taken over numerous parts of the Oldest House, reconfiguring its architecture to its needs, as well as many of the FBC employees to fight for it. The player controls Jesse Faden, who has come to the Oldest House seeking answers about her brother after a prior AWE, and becomes involved in the fight against the Hiss.[2]

Control is built in the Metroidvania format, with a large world map that can be explored at a nonlinear pace, unlike Remedy's previous titles which were primarily linear. As the player completes the main story missions, they will encounter areas known as Control Points, which can be unlocked after clearing the area of enemies and then used both as save points and for fast travel throughout the building to previously unlocked Control Points. As the player completes missions, they unlock more of the building to explore, along with additional side quests, in addition to various rewards. These include skill points which can be used to improve psychokinetic powers that Jesse gains over the course of the game, such as projectile-launching debris at enemies or seizing control of enemies' minds temporarily to turn them into her allies.[2] Mission rewards include resources that can be used to improve the function of the Service Weapon, a special gun that can take on multiple forms, ranging from a close-range shotgun-like blast to long-range sniper-like form, with each form outfitted with various perks. The player can equip perks to improve Jesse's base attributes. Various side-quests and optional time-limited mission alerts are available with additional rewards if completed.[3][2]

An A.I. system known as the Encounter Director controls interactions with enemies based on the player's level and location in the Oldest House.[4] Enemies in Control are predominantly human agents of the FBC possessed by the Hiss, an otherworldly force. They range from standard humans carrying firearms to heavily mutated variations that possess a variety of superpowers.[2]

Synopsis
Setting
Control revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a clandestine U.S. government agency which investigates supernatural Altered World Events (AWEs). These AWEs are affected by the human collective unconscious and have a variety of "paranatural" effects, including the creation of Objects of Power, archetypal items which grant special abilities to their wielders. Objects of Power are connected to the Board, a black pyramid-shaped entity which exists within the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension. The individual chosen by the Board to wield the Service Weapon, an Object of Power, is considered by default to be the director of the FBC.[5] Control takes place within the Oldest House, a Brutalist skyscraper in New York City that serves as the headquarters of the FBC. The Oldest House is a Place of Power with several paranatural characteristics: it resists being noticed by anyone other than FBC members and individuals with an innate sensitivity to the paranatural, it is larger on the inside than on the outside, and its internal architecture is prone to shifting and rearranging in unpredictable ways. The FBC is able to stabilize portions of the Oldest House for its use by harnessing nexuses of resonance called Control Points.

The protagonist of Control is Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), who is chosen by the Board as the director of the FBC to replace the recently deceased Zachariah Trench (James McCaffrey). Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and her younger brother Dylan (Sean Durrie) were involved in an Altered World Event in their hometown of Ordinary, Maine. After discovering an Object of Power in the form of a slide projector, the two children accidentally unleashed paranatural forces which caused Ordinary's adult population to vanish. Jesse and Dylan were rescued by Polaris, a mysterious telepathic entity. Shortly thereafter, the FBC arrived in Ordinary, capturing Dylan and the slide projector while Jesse fled. In the present day, Jesse arrives at the Oldest House seeking her brother's whereabouts.

Other notable characters in Control include missing Head of Research Casper Darling (Matthew Porretta), research specialist Emily Pope (Antonia Bernath), security chief Simon Arish (Ronan Summers), Head of Operations Helen Marshall (Jade Anouka), Panopticon supervisor Frederick Langston (Derek Hagen), and Ahti (Martti Suosalo), a mysterious Finnish janitor.

Plot
In October 2019,[6] Jesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House following a telepathic message from Polaris, seeking the whereabouts of her kidnapped brother Dylan. Inside the building, She discovers the lifeless body of Zachariah Trench, and is instructed by Polaris to pick up his fallen Service Weapon. The weapon translocates her to the Astral Plane, where the Board appoints her as the new director of the FBC in Trench's stead. Exiting Trench's office, Jesse is attacked by FBC agents possessed by an entity she dubs "the Hiss". She learns that the Oldest House is under emergency lockdown following the Hiss's spread, and that everyone in the building has been possessed by the Hiss except those wearing Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices built by missing Bureau scientist Dr. Casper Darling. Jesse agrees to aid the surviving agents in reclaiming the building and containing the Hiss, in exchange for Dylan's whereabouts.

Using an Object of Power known as the Hotline, Jesse communicates with the deceased Trench and learns that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau. After lifting the building's lockdown in the Maintenance Sector, Jesse enters the Research Sector in search of Helen Marshall, one of the members of Trench's management team, whom she helps secure the production of more HRAs. Marshall reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as Prime Candidate 6 (P6), was being groomed to succeed Trench as the Bureau's director due to his immense supernatural abilities. However, after killing several Bureau agents, Dylan was deemed too dangerous and locked away in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has escaped and surrendered to the Bureau in the Executive Sector. Dylan reveals to Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, and that the Hiss entered the Oldest House through the slide projector Object of Power the Bureau recovered from Ordinary.

Ahti, a paranatural entity who manifests as a janitor, gives Jesse a cassette player which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the slide projector's chamber in the Research Sector. She finds the slide projector missing, but learns that Trench and Darling used the device to enter an alternate dimension known as Slidescape-36, where they discovered an entity they dubbed Hedron. Jesse finds Hedron and discovers that it is Polaris, but moments later, the Hiss attacks and destroys Hedron. Jesse's mind is invaded by the Hiss, but she is able to rediscover Polaris within herself, allowing her to fight off the Hiss and save the Bureau. In the process, Jesse learns that Trench was the first individual to be possessed by the Hiss during the expeditions to Slidescape-36, and was responsible for releasing the Hiss into the Oldest House. Jesse finds the slide projector in the Executive Sector, where Dylan and the Hiss are attempting to enter the Astral Plane through a portal and overtake the Board. She deactivates the slide projector and seemingly cleanses the Hiss from Dylan, which closes the portal but leaves him in a coma. In the aftermath, the Oldest House remains infested by the Hiss and under lockdown to prevent its escape, but Jesse has come to terms with her new role as director and resolves to find a solution together with the FBC's surviving personnel.

The Foundation
Jesse is summoned by the Board to the Foundation, a cavernous area lying at the center of the Oldest House which houses the Nail, an object that connects the Oldest House to the Astral Plane. Jesse finds that the Nail has been seriously damaged, which is causing the Astral Plane to leak into the Oldest House, with potentially catastrophic consequences. As Jesse attempts to restore the Nail, she seeks the whereabouts of Helen Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the Hiss invasion, and has gone missing. Meanwhile, Jesse discovers logs left behind by Theodore Ash, Jr., the former Head of Research who was part of the first expeditions to the Oldest House in 1964. Ash reveals that Broderick Northmoor, the director who preceded Trench, fell under the Board's influence during the expedition, and was responsible for radically changing the Bureau in order to serve the Board's interests.

As Jesse continues to restore the Nail, she encounters Former, an extradimensional entity which grants Jesse a new ability, enraging the Board. Former claims to have once been a member of the Board, but was exiled after being blamed for an unknown transgression. Torn between the two entities, Jesse is eventually able to restore the Nail, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss. With the aid of Former, Jesse kills Marshall and cleanses the Nail. Jesse learns that it was Marshall who damaged the Nail, as a preventative measure against both the Hiss and the Board. Marshall's HRA was destroyed soon after, with her believing it to be retaliation by the Board, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. With the crisis averted but her faith in the Board shattered, Jesse vows to lead the Bureau her own way.

AWE
AWE is a crossover between Control and Remedy Entertainment's previous title, Alan Wake. Alan Wake takes place in Bright Falls, Washington; in that game, writer Alan Wake finds himself coerced and trapped by the Dark Presence that inhabited Bright Falls' Cauldron Lake, a dimension able to turn works of art into reality. Following the events of Alan Wake (as described in Control), Emil Hartman, a psychologist who attempted to investigate and exploit this power, was confronted and arrested by agents of the FBC, who confiscated all of his research on the lake. In a final act of desperation, Hartman dove into Cauldron Lake and was possessed by the Dark Presence. Hartman was subsequently captured and brought to the Oldest House by the Bureau, who attempted to contain him in the Investigations Sector. However, after Hartman breached containment, the Bureau was forced to abandon and seal off almost all of the sector. During the Hiss invasion, the Hiss mixed with the Dark Presence in Hartman, twisting him into a monstrous entity which haunts the sector.

Jesse is summoned to the Investigations Sector by an apparition of Alan Wake, who otherwise was considered missing after the events of Alan Wake. She encounters Hartman and is warned by Frederick Langston that Hartman cannot be allowed to escape the sector. As Jesse attempts to traverse the Investigations Sector and destroy Hartman, she receives visions of Alan revealing that he was responsible for writing Hartman's escape into existence, using Cauldron Lake's power to influence reality using works of art. Alan also implies that his writing helped cause the Hiss invasion, as to create a "crisis" for his "hero", Jesse, as part of his attempt to escape from Cauldron Lake.[6] Jesse reaches the Bright Falls AWE area of the Investigations Sector and destroys Hartman. She is informed by Langston of a newly detected AWE in Bright Falls, the date of which is several years in the future.

Development
Control was developed by Remedy Entertainment. As their first major release since their initial public offering in 2017 and separation from Microsoft as a publishing partner, Control was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to Alan Wake and Quantum Break which took seven and five years to complete respectively, Control was completed within three years with a €30 million budget, lower than the typical costs of a triple-A game.[7]

Mikael Kasurinen, who worked on Alan Wake (as lead gameplay designer) and Quantum Break (as lead director), was Control's director and Sam Lake served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.[8][9] Development of the game began before the release of Quantum Break.[10] As they were finishing Quantum Break and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on full motion video and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.[11] Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.[10] The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.[12] Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.[10] They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is "narrowly focused" according to Kasurinen.[13]

Setting
The first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.[11] This enabled Remedy to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.[11] The gathered writings of the fictional SCP Foundation ("Secure, Contain, Protect") website was a major influence on Control. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. Control was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.[14] They fixed the story in the genre of the new weird, a modern variant of weird fiction with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In Control, they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative designer Brooke Maggs stated "there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling".[15] The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to world design director Stuart MacDonald.[15] The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.[15]

The everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a floppy disk. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the United States national missile defense sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.[15] The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as pneumatic tubes, slide projectors and monochrome monitors, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as cell phones, is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.


AT&T Long Lines Building served as inspiration for the Oldest House.
The Oldest House setting was based on brutalist architecture, a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has "this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, "it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture".[16] The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game. It served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.[16] Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is 33 Thomas Street, formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a "bizarre, brutalist monolith" to house the FBC.[16] Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the Boston City Hall, the Andrews Building at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and the Met Breuer.[16]

Other real-world architects inspired the game's structures. Carlo Scarpa's work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while Tadao Ando's focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.[16] Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of Stanley Kubrick, particularly A Clockwork Orange, as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as The Shape of Water, served as part of the design basis.[16] Other films, like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.[16] Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.[16]

Certain areas of the game feature full-motion video sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by Matthew Porretta. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called "The Threshold Kids", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children who may reside within the Oldest House. "The Threshold Kids" was written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.[15] Poets of the Fall, an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including "Take Control", in-game stated to be by the fictional band "The Old Gods of Asgard", itself an allusion back to Alan Wake.[17] Remedy used this song as part of the game's "Ashtray Maze", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of rooms set to the song. Remedy worked with Poets of the Fall so that they could incorporate the song dynamically as the player progressed through sections of the maze.[18]

The core game includes Easter eggs referring to Alan Wake, which shares similar paranormal themes with Control; one such Easter egg discusses the aftermath of Alan Wake as part of the FBC's case files, which concerned what happened in Bright Falls, the primary location of Alan Wake, to have been an AWE.[19] A secret area includes a vision of Alan Wake. The past event in the town of Ordinary was alluded to by a backmasking track in the credits sequence of Alan Wake: American Nightmare, with an unknown speaker stating "It will happen again, in another town. A town called Ordinary."[20][17] Kasurinen said that the inclusion of such references helps to establish a type of continuity between its games, elements to be found and shared by its player community, but not meant to necessarily establish a shared universe between the games.[21] However, Sam Lake later confirmed the existence of a shared universe between Alan Wake and Control known as the Remedy Connected Universe.[22] This later was cemented with the release of the AWE expansion, directly bringing characters and events of Alan Wake into Control.

Cast
The game's main voice cast was announced at New York Comic Con in 2018, consisting of various actors from Remedy's previous games. Courtney Hope, who played the character Beth Wilder in Quantum Break, stars as Jesse Faden, while James McCaffrey, known for his roles as the title character of Max Payne and Thomas Zane in Alan Wake, plays the role of Zachariah Trench. Matthew Porretta, who portrayed the titular character of Alan Wake, is featured in both voice roles and live-action videos as the character of Dr. Casper Darling.[23][12] Finnish actor Martti Suosalo voices the janitor Ahti. Remedy's Sam Lake said that he had been yearning to add his native Finland to one of their games, and Control presented that opportunity to incorporate this. Among these pieces is a Finnish tango which Lake wrote, Petri Alanko composed, and Suosalo sang.[24]

The game includes a voice cameo by Hideo Kojima and his English translator Aki Saito; in one side mission, a recording by Dr. Yoshimi Tokui, voiced by Kojima, relates a dream-like experience in Japanese, with the English translation given by Saito.[25]

Technology

Control is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time ray tracing. Here, the bottom image, with ray-tracing turned on, shows reflections of lights and other surfaces in the marble floor, compared to the more traditionally rendered version, shown on top.
A further challenge in the game's design and implementation involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional heads-up display for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.[11] This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.[11] They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the Havok physics in their in-house game engine with PhysX, and improved their artificial intelligence to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.[11] Control is built using Remedy's proprietary Northlight Engine, which was first used on the company's previous title Quantum Break.[26]

Control was one of the first major games to be released after the introduction of graphics cards that support real-time ray-tracing through DirectX Raytracing. It was the first major title with a nearly-full implementation of all available Nvidia RTX features along with support for Nvidia's DLSS for resolution upscaling on supported graphics cards.[27] The game also supports more standard rendering techniques suitable for less powerful graphical hardware.

Nvidia heavily promoted Control in its campaign alongside its first RTX graphics cards featuring hardware ray-tracing support.[28] The game was bundled with sales of graphics cards supporting the RTX technology.[29] Nvidia created or hosted nine videos, including an exclusive gameplay trailer, to display the game's ray-tracing integration.

Release
Marketing
In May 2017, Remedy announced that they had partnered with 505 Games to publish the game, then codenamed "P7". 505 provided marketing and publishing support and a fund of €7.75 million to assist the game's development, while Remedy retained the intellectual property rights to Control. In the press release, Remedy revealed that the game will have complex gameplay mechanics and that it will be a "longer term experience" than its previous games.[30] P7 was being worked on by Remedy alongside two other projects.[31] The game was officially revealed at Sony Interactive Entertainment's E3 2018 press conference.[32]

Control was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 27 August 2019.[33] Epic Games had secured a year-long exclusivity deal for Control on the Epic Games Store with Digital Bros, the parent of 505 Games, for €9.49 million (US$10.5 million).[34]

On 27 August 2020, the first anniversary of the game's release, Control: Ultimate Edition was released via Steam, including the base game, both the "Foundation" and "AWE" expansions, and the additional free updates. Control: Ultimate Edition launched on the Epic Games Store, GOG.com, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 10 September 2020, and on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 2 February 2021.[35][36] Players who owned the Ultimate Edition on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One were able to update their version to the newer consoles for free.[37][38] 505 Games stated that while they looked to find a free upgrade path that would work for all users but that there was "some form of blocker and those blockers meant that at least one group of players ended up being left out of the upgrade for various reasons."[39] The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions and updates were delayed until early 2021 in an announcement just prior to the consoles' launches in November 2020 to improve the quality of the product.[40] Digital versions were released on 2 February 2021, and retail copies on 2 March 2021.[41] The Ultimate Edition was also released for Amazon Luna on 20 January 2022.[42]

Cloud gaming-based versions of the game were released for Amazon Luna and Nintendo Switch on 20 October 2020 and 28 October 2020, respectively.[43] It was the first cloud-based game released on the Switch outside of Japan.[44] Control was released on Google Stadia in July 2021.[45] A version for macOS was released on 26 March 2025.[46]

Post-release
Remedy affirmed plans for at least two additional content expansions to Control, titled "The Foundation" and "AWE", both narratively set after the main game with Jesse taking on her role as the FBC Director. However, at the time of Control's launch, the specifics of this content had yet to be determined, according to narrative designer Brooke Maggs, as the team's focus was on addressing performance issues for the console version of the games.[12] "The Foundation" released on 26 March 2020 for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows and for Xbox One on 25 June 2020.[47] The second expansion "AWE" was released on 27 August 2020, marking the game's first anniversary.[48][49][50]

Additional smaller, non-narrative content has been released.[12] The first, "Expeditions", was released as a free update on 12 December 2019, and presents standalone missions of various difficulty with power-up items for their character.[47] A free update, released alongside the "AWE" DLC but available for all players, increased the number of control points, or "hard" checkpoints in the game where saving the game is possible, including adding ones before boss fights, as well as several "soft" checkpoints where players can restart without having to travel back to a control point should Jesse die. A new "assist mode" was also added to allow for the player to have more control on customizing the game's difficulty, with Remedy intending this to make it possible for novice players to complete the game.[51]

In January 2021, The Art and Making of Control, a companion book about the development of Control, was published by Future Press.[52]

In February 2024, Remedy acquired full ownership of the Control series from 505 Games.[53] In August, the company partnered with Annapurna Pictures to adapt existing Remedy games to films and television, including Control series.[54]

In March 2025, the Ultimate Edition received a free update that added previously exclusive content, including pre-order bonuses and a PlayStation 4 mission featuring Hideo Kojima, and various graphical enhancements.[55]

Critical reception
Control received "generally favorable" reviews from critics for most platforms, except for the Nintendo Switch version which received "mixed or average" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[56][57][58][73]

Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb awarded it 5 out of 5 stars and stated it is "a smart and sensational action-adventure."[74] Phil Iwaniuk of PCGamesN gave the game a positive review and stated it as "a gripping descent into something between alternate history and fever dream, realized beautifully in audiovisual flair, and lacking just slightly in the combat itself."[75] Sam Loveridge of GamesRadar+ awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars and praised its "unique" setting, "TV-like" storytelling, "phenomenal" characters and "downright bonkers" moments, though criticized its short length.[76] James Davenport of PC Gamer gave the game a score of 88/100 and praised its "mystery, wonder, and glorious room-destroying combat", though criticized its "thin" protagonist and "abrupt" ending.[77] Jonathon Dornbush of IGN gave the game 8.8/10 and praised the "engrossingly weird paranormal world", Jesse's "versatile psychic skills and main weapon", "strong" supporting cast, "well-written" script, though called Jesse's personal story an "afterthought".[78]

Peter Brown of GameSpot gave the game 8/10 and praised the "gorgeous" art style, "fascinating" sets, "stylish" combat, though criticized the "confusing" map.[79] Dave Tach of Polygon and stated, "I can't separate Control's deliberate oddities from its beauty or from its characters, and that's what makes it so easy to recommend."[80] Michael Leri of GameRevolution gave the game 9/10 and praised the "fast-paced" combat, "intriguing" lore, challenging puzzles, cast, "beautifully constructed & destructible" environments, though criticized its "shaky performance on non-Pro consoles", "overly punishing" boss fights and long checkpoints.[81] Michael Huber of Easy Allies gave the game 9/10 and stated it as an "incredible marriage of storytelling, world building, exploration, and combat", praising the "obsessive" attention to detail, ensemble cast and the protagonist.[82]

Mike Williams of USgamer gave the game 4/5 and stated, "The Oldest House allows Remedy to play with new ideas and variations on traditional gameplay, breaking up the shooting and superhuman powers with games of red light/green light and journeys through Alice in Wonderland-style mazes. The dialog is still odd, and the mission structure can be obtuse at times."[83] Gabe Gurwin of Digital Trends gave the game 3.5/5 and praised the gunplay, abilities, cast, presentation and setting, though criticized its story, texture issues, "filler" side missions and "unoriginal" powers.[84] Christian Donlan of Eurogamer praised its "giddy" action and "astonishing" art design.[85]

Digital Foundry and Polygon considered Control on PC to potentially be a "killer app" for Nvidia's RTX graphics cards, citing it as helping to enhance the game's visual style.[86][87]

Metal Gear series creator, Hideo Kojima, has expressed that he is a huge fan of Control,[88] and as proof of this, he visited Remedy's studio during his visit to Finland in 2019.[88][89][90]

Sales
By December 2020, Control had sold over 2 million units and Remedy stated the game was their fastest-growing intellectual property since Max Payne.[91] By August 2021, Remedy stated that over 10 million people had played Control, accounting for those that played it through Xbox Game Pass and other non-sales routes.[92] By February 2024, the game had sold over 4 million units, with over €100 million in revenue.[93] By November, it had sold over 4.5 million units and reached over 19 million lifetime players.[94]

In Japan, the PlayStation 4 version sold 10,336 physical units, making it the 13th best-selling retail game during its first week of release.[95]

Awards

Cliché Audit: CONTROL (2019)  
Format: Video Game  
Developer: Remedy Entertainment  
Release Year: 2019  

Low Risk Clichés (Well-Executed or Genre-Aligned)
--------------------------------------------------

A. NARRATIVE FUNCTION: Metaphysical Premise or High Concept  
  i. “Reality is not what it seems”  
     - Reframed with bureaucratic specificity: Control’s surrealism is grounded in documentation, policy, and object classification, avoiding vagueness through concrete detail.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Individuation and rational framing of anomalies via internal FBC language system.  

  ii. Secret government agency handling supernatural threats  
     - Standard trope inverted: the agency is the primary location and not simply an instigator or backdrop.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Perspective-taking through Jesse’s outsider status and gradual integration into institutional power.  

  iii. “Object of Power” as a MacGuffin  
     - Subverted by overabundance: dozens of objects, each uniquely contextualized with reports, videos, and psychic consequences.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Counterstereotypical exemplar — objects are not plot tokens but repositories of narrative detail.  

B. CHARACTER FUNCTION: Player-Protagonist Mystery  
  i. “Amnesiac or uncertain identity”  
     - Partially invoked, but Jesse retains clear motivation and awareness of her goals from the start.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Agency-forward structure — player investigates with Jesse, not for her.  

  ii. “Chosen One”  
     - The trope is undercut by confusion, accident, and mysticism (Polaris, the Board), questioning whether Jesse’s selection is merit-based or incidental.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Deconstruction — Jesse doesn’t crave power and often questions her control.  

  iii. Eerie janitor as magical guide  
     - Ahti fulfills this role but is heavily individualized: he’s musically inclined, Finnish, and appears to operate on a logic outside player comprehension.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Individuation and cultural specificity.  

C. STRUCTURAL OR LORE DEVICES  
  i. “Unseen ancient force manipulates events”  
     - Used with full metafictional awareness (e.g., the Board’s bureaucratic language, unreliable agency).  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Narrative deconstruction — the game examines *how* and *why* power structures interpret forces they don’t understand.  

  ii. “Mysterious sibling with dangerous powers”  
     - Dylan is emotionally complex and doesn’t simply “turn evil”; his embrace of the Hiss reads more like surrender than ambition.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Evaluative conditioning — the player’s emotional association with Dylan is shaped through flashbacks and Jesse’s own voice-over.  

Medium Risk Clichés (Familiar but Slightly Reconfigured)
--------------------------------------------------------

D. WORLD AND AESTHETIC  
  i. “Brutalist architecture equals dystopia”  
     - Brutalism is dominant, but it’s celebrated for its solidity, functionality, and mood — not depicted as oppressive by default.  
     - Partial mitigation via perspective-taking — the architecture is as much Jesse’s battleground as it is her shelter.  

  ii. “Government agencies are always hiding something”  
     - True here, but the FBC’s secrecy is framed as procedural rather than malicious; personnel like Emily Pope and Langston exhibit sincerity and humanity.  
     - Partial mitigation via individuation — many employees are depicted with warmth and specificity.  

  iii. “Female protagonist with psychic powers = isolated and burdened”  
     - Jesse is initially alone, but forms collaborative bonds (Pope, Arish, Darling in recordings), and ends with a new sense of collective purpose.  
     - Partial mitigation through theme-consistent empowerment and recovery of trust.  

E. GAMEPLAY OR DESIGN STRUCTURE  
  i. “Collectibles used to deliver all the worldbuilding”  
     - Control *does* rely heavily on collectibles, but they are meticulously written, varied in format (videos, reports, puppet shows), and paced to complement the main plot.  
     - Mitigation Strategy: Individuation and perspective-taking — documents often present competing narratives or flawed bureaucratic framing.  

  ii. “Story interrupts gameplay flow”  
     - Several reviews noted frustration with late-game difficulty spikes or abrupt narrative pivots (e.g., Jesse’s psychic collapse after Hedron’s death).  
     - Mitigation is partial: the tone shift is thematic but could be structurally more integrated.  

  iii. “Power escalation leads to disconnection from stakes”  
     - Jesse’s abilities do escalate rapidly, but gameplay often maintains difficulty by escalating Hiss threats and space-warping challenges (Ashtray Maze, Foundation).  
     - Partial mitigation via encounter scaling and psychological stakes (Dylan, the Board).  

Unclichéd or Defied Tropes (Executed with High Originality)
-----------------------------------------------------------

F. STYLE AND STRUCTURE  
  i. Bureaucratic horror with philosophical themes  
     - New Weird lens applied to horror-action gameplay: mundane forms (forms, memos, office spaces) contextualize the paranormal.  
     - No mitigation required: innovation through fusion of genres and tonal dissonance.  

  ii. Music-driven boss sequence ("Ashtray Maze")  
     - Poets of the Fall’s song integration creates ludonarrative harmony — music, movement, and story align without cutscene intrusion.  
     - No cliché, only expansion of format.  

  iii. Explicit metafiction (Alan Wake crossover and Board intertextuality)  
     - References to other Remedy properties are narratively and thematically grounded, not easter eggs.  
     - No mitigation required: story-as-universe-building done with care and voice consistency.  

  iv. Ending as anti-climax to question player agency  
     - Rather than ending in triumph, Control shifts into continuity — Jesse assumes her role, but the House and Hiss remain.  
     - Emphasizes "control" as an illusion — subverts typical final boss/game-over reward loop.  

SUMMARY  
Control demonstrates a thoughtful, deliberate subversion or reframing of many common genre and narrative clichés. Its use of the New Weird genre, SCP-style documentation, and brutalist surrealism allows it to explore themes of power, identity, and institutional logic without sacrificing player engagement. The most common tropes it invokes are either rendered moot through specificity (the janitor, the "chosen one") or turned into sources of ambiguity and dread (the Board, the slide projector). Few moments fall back on mechanical or emotional shorthand, and most are supported by individuated characterization and a strong thematic throughline.

Total clichés of note:  
Low-risk: 9  
Medium-risk: 6  
Unclichéd/defied: 4

Alien: Isolation is a 2014 survival horror game developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Based on the Alien film series, the game is set 15 years after the original 1979 film, and follows the engineer Amanda Ripley, voiced by Andrea Deck. Amanda investigates the disappearance of her mother, Ellen Ripley, aboard the space station Sevastopol, which is in disarray due to years of corporate negligence and the threat of a rampant alien creature. The game emphasizes stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid, outsmart, and fight various enemies with equipment such as firearms, a motion tracker, stun baton, and a flamethrower.

Alien: Isolation was designed to resemble the original Alien film rather than its more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future could look like. It runs on an engine built to accommodate the alien's behaviour and technical aspects such as atmospheric and lighting effects. Creative Assembly intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but used first-person to create a more intense experience. Several downloadable content packs were released, some of which relive scenes from the original film.

Alien: Isolation received positive reviews and sold over two million copies by May 2015. Its retro-futuristic art direction, sound design, and artificial intelligence were praised, while its story and length received some criticism. Considered one of the best games ever made, Alien: Isolation won several year-end awards, including Best Audio at the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards and Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards. It saw ports to Linux and OS X in 2015, Nintendo Switch in 2019, and Android and iOS mobile devices in 2021. It was also added to the Amazon Luna service in 2021. A television adaptation was released in 2019. In 2024, Creative Assembly announced that a sequel was in development.

Gameplay
Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure game with an emphasis on stealth and survival horror. The player controls Amanda Ripley from a first-person perspective,[1][2] and must explore a space station and complete mission objectives to progress forward in the story while avoiding, outsmarting, and defeating enemies.[3] Specific objectives vary across each of the nineteen missions, but can range from activating computers, talking to NPCs, collecting certain items or reaching specific areas.[4] The player can run, climb ladders, sneak into vents, crouch behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and peek over or lean around for a safe view.[3] The player also has the ability to go under tables or inside empty lockers and cabinets to hide from enemies.[3]

Amanda encounters various enemies throughout the station, including hostile human survivors and androids. The player can either eliminate them or avoid them using stealth or distractions.[3] The main antagonist, the Alien, appears briefly during certain sections across the first four missions, but begins continuously pursuing the player after the completion of mission five, "The Quarantine". The Alien cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive.[2] Instead of following a predetermined path, the Alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound.[3] Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the Alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the Alien finding the player. For example, if the Alien is close enough, it will be attracted by the tracker's sound, forcing the player to use the tracker wisely and remove it as soon as it detects motion.[3] The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine if the Alien is up in the ducts or on ground level. On the game's hardest difficulty setting, Nightmare, the motion tracker is unreliable and the in game mini-map, used to navigate and locate objectives, is unavailable.[3][5]


The player can use the motion tracker to track the Alien's location. When movement is detected in front of the tracker, a circle will appear on its screen, indicating where the movement is located.
Although Amanda gains access to a revolver, shotgun, bolt gun, flamethrower, and stun baton over the course of the game,[6][7] Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing limited ammunition.[2] The player can also craft useful items by collecting schematics and different materials. Items include EMP detonators, noisemakers, molotov cocktails, and pipe bombs; these can help the player deal with enemies.[6] For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in a particular direction. The Alien is afraid of fire, so using flame weapons will force it to temporarily retreat. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies; health is restored with medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory, although all of the Alien's attacks (unless it is retreating) will result in instant death.[3]

The space station is divided into sections connected by trams and elevators. Some doors require certain actions before entry is allowed; for example, some require a keycard or entry codes, while others need to be hacked by an access tuner or cut open with a welding torch.[5] Computer terminals and rewiring stations can be used to access information and trigger actions such as disabling security cameras or manipulating the station's air-purification and alarm mechanism. These actions may help to momentarily divert the attention away from the player's position.[5] To save game progress, the player needs to locate a save station terminal and insert Amanda's access card. There is a three second pause before the save can be completed, meaning the player can be killed while attempting to save.[8] If Amanda dies, the player will have to restart from the last saved point.[9] In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a special mode, called Survivor Mode, in which the player must complete objectives within a time limit on different challenge maps while being hunted by the Alien.[10]

Plot
In 2137, fifteen years after her mother Ellen went missing onboard the USCSS Nostromo, Amanda Ripley learns from Weyland-Yutani android Christopher Samuels that the Nostromo's flight recorder has been recovered and taken to Sevastopol, a space station owned by Seegson Corporation which orbits the gas giant KG-348 in the Zeta Reticuli system. Samuels offers Amanda a place on the retrieval team to give her closure, and she accepts. Amanda, Samuels and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to the station via the USCSS Torrens with the help of the ship's captain Diane Verlaine. After finding the station too damaged to dock, the trio attempt to enter it via a spacewalk, but their EVA line is severed by an explosion, and Amanda is separated from the others.

Making her way through the station, Amanda discovers that it has descended into chaos due the presence of a hostile alien onboard. She eventually finds the flight recorder, but discovers that its data has been corrupted. Amanda then makes her way to Samuels and Taylor; retrieving medical supplies for an injured Taylor, she meets Marshal Waits and follows him back to his bureau. There, Amanda meets the imprisoned captain of the USCSS Anesidora, Henry Marlow, who explains he recovered the flight recorder and went to LV-426, where his wife was impregnated by a facehugger before she fatally birthed the alien on Sevastopol. Waits convinces Amanda to lure the alien to one of the station's modules, where it can be ejected into space. However, Waits ejects the module with Amanda still inside, forcing her to space-jump back to Sevastopol using a space suit.

Amanda returns to the bureau to confront Waits, but before she arrives Sevastopol's service androids begin killing the remaining humans, including Waits. Working with Waits' deputy Ricardo, Amanda links up with Samuels, who sacrifices himself to help her access the control core of Sevastopol's artificial intelligence APOLLO and is destroyed in the process. Amanda also learns from Ricardo that Taylor was secretly sent to retrieve the alien and freed Marlow. At the core, Amanda discovers Weyland-Yutani purchased Sevastopol from Seegson before she arrived at the station, ordering APOLLO to protect the alien at all costs. Amanda informs APOLLO that the alien is no longer onboard, but it responds by stating that "reactor scans are unverified". Descending into the reactor, Amanda finds a nest with numerous aliens, and initiates a reactor purge in an attempt to destroy it. However, this inadvertently forces the aliens to leave the nest, and they begin to hunt Amanda again.

Ricardo informs Ripley that Marlow has returned to the Anesidora, and she follows him. There, Amanda discovers a personal message from Ellen before being confronted by Marlow, who attempts to overload the ship's reactor to destroy Sevastopol and the aliens. Taylor, who also went to the Anesidora, knocks out Marlow but is too late to stop the overload and both are killed in the subsequent explosion, forcing Amanda to flee the ship before it is destroyed. The explosion damages Sevastopol's orbital stabilizers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348's atmosphere. Amanda contacts Verlaine for extraction, but a facehugger attacks Ricardo, forcing her to leave him. After helping the Torrens detach from the station, Amanda enters the ship just before Sevastopol is destroyed. However, she finds an alien has boarded the Torrens and killed Verlaine as well; cornered into an airlock, she ejects both herself and it into space. Some time later, a searchlight finds an adrift and unconscious Amanda.

Development


Like the original Alien film, Alien: Isolation features a lo-fi, '70s vision of what the future would look like. These concept artworks show both the exterior and interior of the game's main setting, Sevastopol Station.
Alien: Isolation was developed by Creative Assembly, which is best known for their work on the Total War strategy video game series.[11] A game based on the Alien series from 20th Century Fox was conceived when Creative Assembly finished Viking: Battle for Asgard in 2008, after the publisher, Sega, acquired the rights to develop Alien games in December 2006.[11][12] A six-person team developed the first prototype to pitch the idea, wherein one player would control the Alien manually while another would conceal themselves in an environment and try to hide from the creature. The game captured the attention of Sega and the project was eventually approved.[11] As Creative Assembly had no experience with survival horror games, it hired people from studios such as Bizarre Creations, Black Rock, Crytek, Ubisoft, and Realtime Worlds.[11] According to the director, Alistair Hope, the team grew from "a couple of guys crammed in with the Total War team" to 100 by 2014.[11]

Creative Assembly designed the game more in line with Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien than James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens.[13] To help them authentically recreate the atmosphere of the film, Fox provided three terabytes of original production material, including costume photography, concept art, set design, photos, videos and sound effects.[13][14] The artist John Mckellan said, "It was a proper gold mine. We saw angles of things we'd never seen before."[13] During the first stage of development, the developers deconstructed the film to find out what made its setting unique. This would allow them to build new environments that were faithful to it.[13] The composers deconstructed the film soundtrack to identify the main cues and extend the soundtrack to fill in the length of the game.[15] The developers also met the Alien and Blade Runner editor Terry Rawlings, who gave them additional insight.[13]

Rather than pursue a shiny, high-tech science fiction look, the designers recreated the setting and feel of Alien using the work of the concept artists Ron Cobb and Mœbius.[14] As a result, the game features a lo-fi, 1970s vision of the future, with features "clunky" machinery such as phone receivers, monochrome displays and distorted CRT monitors.[2][14] To create period-authentic distortion on the in-game monitors, the developers recorded their animations onto VHS and Betamax, then filmed those sequences playing on an old portable television while adjusting the tracking settings.[14] As digital hacking had not been conceived in the 1970s, the hacking device was built the way it would have been built on the set of the film, and requires players to tune into a computer's signal while selecting icons on its screen.[14] The team had a rule of not creating anything that the film crew could not have created as a prop in 1979.[16]

Creative Assembly wanted Alien: Isolation to have a story that was closely related to the film. They explored a story set 15 years after the film which would involve Ellen Ripley's daughter and the Nostromo's flight recorder.[13] The writer Will Porter said creating the backstory for Amanda was "refreshing" as he felt that she was an overlooked character.[17] The actress Sigourney Weaver reprised her role as Ellen Ripley to voice small sections because she felt that the story was interesting and true to the film.[18] Along with Weaver, the original Alien cast, which includes Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto, reprised their roles for the separate downloadable content missions, marking the first time they were reunited since the release of the film.[19] All the characters were created with 3D face scans.[20] The story was rewritten about a year before release; elements of the previous story were discovered in a console build.[21]

Alien: Isolation runs on a proprietary engine that was built from scratch by Creative Assembly.[14] Previously used in Viking: Battle for Asgard,[22] the engine was adapted to accommodate technical aspects such as the atmospheric and lighting effects and the Alien's behavioural design.[14] The engine's deferred rendering allowed artists to place "hundreds" of dynamic lights in a scene and achieve great geometric detail.[23] A major toolchain update occurred six months into development. Although the new tools eventually improved workflow, they initially caused major disruptions because previous work had to be discarded or ported into the new tools, taking valuable development time away from the team.[22] The Alien was designed to look similar to H. R. Giger's original design, including the skull underneath its semitransparent head. However, the designers did alter its humanoid legs with recurved ones to provide the Alien a walk cycle that would hold up to scrutiny during longer encounters with the player.[24] Between 70 and 80 different sets of animation for the Alien were created.[14] The Alien's artificial intelligence was programmed with a complex set of behavioural designs that slowly unlock as it encounters the player, creating the illusion that the Alien learns from each interaction and appropriately adjusts its hunting strategy.[14] The gameplay designer Gary Napper said, "We needed something that would be different every time you played it. You're going to die a lot, which means restarting a lot, and if the Alien was scripted, you'd see the same behaviour. That makes the Alien become predictable, and a lot less scary."[14] The save system was inspired by a scene in the film where Captain Dallas uses a key-card to access Nostromo's computer, Mother.[9]

The developers originally planned to add a feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, "We thought about what people would want to do in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger."[13] Another cancelled feature was the Alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was reportedly implemented at one point, it was removed because the developers felt it would take the game in a "weird" direction.[13][14] Although the game is played from a first-person perspective, it was developed for a considerable amount of time in third-person view. The perspective was changed after the team realised that first person changed the gameplay experience significantly. Hope explained that, in third-person view, Alien: Isolation would have become "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move."[13] Development took four years after Creative Assembly pitched the idea to Sega.[13] Alien: Isolation was released to manufacturing on 9 September 2014.[25] It is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer who died during development.[26]

Marketing and release
Alien: Isolation was first unveiled on 12 May 2011 when UK government minister Ed Vaizey visited Creative Assembly and revealed on his Twitter account that the studio was hiring for an Alien game.[27] Although no gameplay details were confirmed, Sega confirmed that Isolation would be released for consoles.[27] Sega boss Mike Hayes said it was "very much a triple-A project. We want this to be a peer to the likes of Dead Space 2."[27] Although the game's name was anticipated following a trademark registration in October 2013 and some screenshots leaked in December 2013,[28][29] Alien: Isolation was announced and confirmed for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One with the release of a teaser trailer on 7 January 2014.[30] The fact that Sega's previous Alien game, Aliens: Colonial Marines, received a negative public reaction did not affect Creative Assembly.[31] According to Napper, the vocal reaction from the Alien fanbase assured the team that they were building a game the fanbase wanted.[31]

Alien: Isolation was presented at E3 2014, where journalists had a chance to play the game.[32] Polygon described the demo as effective and terrifying.[32] The game was also playable on the Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset that was shown at the show.[33] It was awarded Best VR Game and was nominated for Game of the Show, Best Xbox One Game, Best PlayStation 4 Game, Best PC Game, and Best Action Game at the IGN's Best of E3 2014 Awards.[34][35][36] At the 2014 Game Critics Awards, it was nominated for Best of Show, Best Console Game, and Best Action/Adventure Game.[37][38] In August 2014, a cinematic trailer was shown at Gamescom.[39]

Alien: Isolation was released on 7 October 2014.[40] Isolation was ported by Feral Interactive to Linux and OS X in late 2015,[41] to Nintendo Switch on 5 December 2019,[42][43] and to Android and iOS devices on 16 December 2021,[44] and was added to the Amazon Luna service on 14 October 2021.[45]

Downloadable content
Alien: Isolation supports additional in-game content in the form of downloadable content packs. The first two packs, Crew Expendable and Last Survivor, were made available at the time of release.[19] Crew Expendable, included in the "Nostromo Edition", relives a scene from Alien and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush an Alien from the Nostromo's air vents into the ship's airlock.[19] Last Survivor, which was originally made available to players who pre-ordered at certain retailers, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley as she tries to activate the Nostromo's self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle.[19]

Between October 2014 and March 2015, five additional downloadable content packs were released, expanding the Survivor Mode with new features.[46] A season pass to these five Survivor Mode packs could be purchased before they were released.[47] The first pack, Corporate Lockdown, was released on 28 October 2014 and includes three new challenge maps where the player must complete certain objectives.[46] The second pack, Trauma, was released on 2 December 2014 and includes a new character for use in three additional challenge maps.[48] The third pack, Safe Haven, was released on 13 January 2015 and introduces a new character and a new gameplay mode where the player must complete a series of missions under a time limit.[49] The fourth pack, Lost Contact, which was released on 10 February 2015, is similar to Safe Haven, but offers a different playable character and setting.[50] The last pack, The Trigger, was released on 3 March 2015 and includes three additional challenge maps and a new playable character.[51] A collection featuring the base game and all the downloadable content packs was released for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in late 2015.[52]

Critical reception for Alien: Isolation was "generally favourable", according to review aggregator Metacritic.[56][57][58] Josh Harmon of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that Alien: Isolation "succeeds as a genuine effort to capture the spirit of the film franchise in playable form, rather than a lazy attempt to use it as an easy backdrop for a cash-in with an ill-fitting genre."[62] Writing for GameSpot, Kevin VanOrd praised the tense and frightening gameplay, stating that "when all mechanics are working as intended, alien-evasion is dread distilled into its purest, simplest form."[5] However, he criticised the "trial and error" progression and frustrating distances between save points.[5] Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer stated similar pros, but criticised the voice acting and dialogue.[63]

The visuals and atmosphere were praised. Polygon editor Arthur Gies felt that Alien: Isolation is "a beautiful game, full of deep shadows and mystery around every corner," while Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer praised the lighting and unusually compelling environment design.[6][68] IGN's Ryan McCaffrey gave high marks to the retro-futuristic art direction and sound design, writing: "From wisps of smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure your vision when you rewire an area's life-support systems in order to aid your stealthy objectives, Isolation certainly looks and sounds like a part of the Alien universe."[67] Similarly, PC Gamer said that the art design sets Alien: Isolation apart from the likes of System Shock or Dead Space and creates a "convincing science-fiction world, with machines and environments that are functional and utilitarian, rather than overtly futuristic."[2]

The characters were criticised; Game Informer stated that "Amanda exhibits little growth or personality, other than concern for her fellow humans and a desire not to die gruesomely,"[63] while Blake Peterson of GameRevolution noted that none of the characters are fully developed. According to him, "we never spend enough time with them to build the emotional bond necessary for their inevitable deaths to mean anything."[64] GameTrailers said that most of the computer terminals contain unoriginal logs to describe predictable events, but also remarked that reading reports from different computer terminals "grounds Sevastopol in an appreciable way."[66]

Writing for GamesRadar, David Houghton praised the Alien's advanced artificial intelligence, stating that "progress becomes a case of 'if' and 'how', not 'when'. Movement is measured in inches and feet rather than metres, and simply remaining alive becomes more exhilarating than any objective achieved."[65] Peterson praised the gameplay as tense, scary and effective, writing that Alien: Isolation is "a solid, incredibly striking example of the [survival horror] genre that uses its first person perspective to greater personalize the horror".[64] PC Gamer credited the crafting system for creating "a lot of unexpected depth", allowing players to outsmart enemies in multiple ways.[2] The Survivor Mode was praised by Chris Carter of Destructoid, who felt it offered players different feelings and experiences each time they played it.[61]

Although the gameplay was praised by several reviewers, some found Isolation unnecessarily long, repetitive, and unforgiving.[5][67][68] In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that it did not offer many options of survival, requiring players to spend most of their time hiding in lockers "staring at the motion tracker".[67] Polygon criticised the overexposure to the Alien, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, "Every time I thought I heard the monster, every blip on my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore — I was annoyed."[68] Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered "brave" by IGN due to its difficult gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs.[71]

Accolades
Alien: Isolation received year-end awards including PC Gamer's Game of the Year 2014, Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards, Best Audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards, and four awards at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers.[72][73][74][75] It was named the best game of 2014 by The Daily Telegraph,[76] second-best by Empire and Time,[77][78] and fourth by The Guardian.[79] The Daily Mirror named it one of the 10 best games of 2014, and Eurogamer readers voted it the third-best.[80][81] In 2015, Kotaku named Alien: Isolation the sixth-best horror game,[82] and in 2018 The A.V. Club ranked it the fifth-best[83] and GamesRadar+ ranked it the third-best.[84] GamesRadar, Game Informer, GamesTM, Gaming Bolt, Sports Illustrated and USA Today named Alien Isolation one of the best video games ever made.[a]

List of awards and nominations
Legacy
In 2014, Napper said the team often discussed ideas for a sequel.[104] The Creative Assembly head, Tim Heaton, said in 2015 they were proud of Isolation and that a sequel was "not out of the question" but financially unfeasible.[55] In 2017, Eurogamer reported that no sequel was in development and that most of the Isolation design team had left Creative Assembly.[105] On 7 October 2024, the 10th anniversary of the game's release, Creative Assembly announced that a sequel was in early development, with most of the original team returning.[106]

Two comic book sequels, Aliens: Resistance and Aliens: Rescue, were released in 2019.[107][108] A spin-off developed by D3 Go, Alien: Blackout, was released for mobile devices on 24 January 2019.[109] It was shut down on 31 October 2023.[110] In 2016, a pinball video game adaptation, Aliens vs. Pinball, was released for the Zen Pinball 2 and Pinball FX 2 video games developed by Zen Studios.[111] A novelisation by Keith DeCandido,[112] and a streaming television series adaptation by Jeff Juhasz and Fabien Dubois, were released in 2019.[113] Alien: Romulus (2024) includes several elements from the game.[b]

ALIEN: ISOLATION — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES  
 1. Legacy Daughter Heroine (Medium)  
    – Amanda Ripley is defined almost entirely by her mother's shadow, tasked with closure instead of self-directed agency.  
 2. One Woman vs. the System (Low)  
    – Amanda becomes the sole competent survivor on Sevastopol, outlasting military, corporate, and scientific personnel.  
 3. Disposable Allies (Medium)  
    – Samuels, Taylor, Waits, Ricardo—all aid Amanda temporarily before dying or vanishing without major consequence.  
 4. Brave Until Death (Low)  
    – Amanda never buckles under pressure, sustaining horror-genre heroine stoicism to an extreme.  
 5. Forced Isolation (Medium)  
    – Amanda is repeatedly separated from others by scripted accidents (explosions, betrayal), enforcing solo narrative.  
 6. Functional but Flat Protagonist (Medium)  
    – Reviews consistently note Amanda’s personality as underwritten, driven more by circumstance than inner complexity.  

II. NARRATIVE / THEME-AFFECTING TROPES  
 7. Derelict Station with a Secret (Low)  
    – Sevastopol is ruined, abandoned, and corrupt—a haunted house in space used for corporate containment.  
 8. Evil Corporation Covers It Up (Low)  
    – Weyland-Yutani’s classic decision to suppress the alien threat for profit is replayed with minimal subversion.  
 9. Audio Logs Reveal Tragedy (Low)  
    – Terminal entries and voice memos describe pre-Amanda horrors, often heard near the corpses they foreshadow.  
10. Lure the Monster into Space (Medium)  
    – Ripley’s plan to eject the alien mirrors the original film’s climax nearly beat for beat.  
11. "Just One More Problem" Ending (Medium)  
    – After surviving the whole game, Amanda still has to eject herself and the alien from the escape vessel.  
12. Nobody Lives, Nothing Is Fixed (Low)  
    – The station is destroyed, allies are dead, and the xenomorph is only barely defeated—typical survival horror resolution.  

III. GAMEPLAY / CINEMATIC-AFFECTING TROPES  
13. Indestructible Stalker Villain (Low)  
    – The Alien cannot be killed; it follows an AI loop and randomly appears with unpredictable deadliness.  
14. Survival by Locker Hiding (Medium)  
    – Players often resort to hiding in lockers or under tables for long stretches, diminishing dramatic variation.  
15. Trial-and-Error Death Loops (Medium)  
    – Save points are scarce; some sections must be memorized and repeated with precision.  
16. Monster Learns Player Behavior (Low)  
    – The Alien adapts subtly over time, feigning intelligence with a complex but ultimately patterned AI.  

IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR / MISCELLANEOUS TROPES  
17. 1970s Future Aesthetic (Low)  
    – Retro CRTs, analog switches, and monochrome terminals stylize the world but are genre-commonplace in Alien media.  
18. Betrayal by Authority Figure (Medium)  
    – Marshal Waits sacrifices Amanda; Taylor betrays the mission—standard tension via human treachery.  
19. Ending in a Cliffhanger (Low)  
    – Amanda’s fate is unresolved; she's adrift in space, echoing horror genre ambiguity over definitive victory.  
20. Collectibles for Lore Padding (Medium)  
    – Significant background details are buried in collectible logs and terminals that many players miss entirely.
