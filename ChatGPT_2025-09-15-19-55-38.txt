From the following, i want a comparison of how successful a game is vs. how well it handles female character agency. Please use all the data and reference it for numbers, agency analysis, and for every bit of context to help a reader understand the relationship between female character agency and whether a game sells well enough to critically and commercially justify making a sequel to it (or succeeding well enough to give the developers enough resources to make another great game of any other sort):

Female Protagonists in Video Games (2005–2025): Agency vs. Objectification

Over the past 20 years, video games have featured an increasing number of female protagonists. However, their portrayals have varied dramatically. This analysis examines two contrasting trends:
	1.	AAA games that strip agency from their female leads, emphasizing excessive trauma or framing them through a voyeuristic male gaze. These games often subject the heroine to relentless suffering, disempowerment, or sexual objectification, as noted by many critics.
	2.	Games that grant female protagonists genuine agency, autonomy, and narrative depth, whether AAA or indie. These titles allow women leads to drive the story through their own choices and growth, avoiding gratuitous victimization or sexualization. Critics often praise these games for their empowering portrayals and richer character development.

Below, examples are organized (where relevant) by developer/publisher and backed by commentary from journalists, critics, and developers. The span covers 2005–2025, highlighting key titles in each category and what they do (or don’t do) when depicting their heroines.

AAA Female Protagonists with Stripped Agency & Trauma Focus

This category includes major titles that have been criticized for focusing on the heroine’s suffering, reducing her agency, or presenting her through a voyeuristic lens. These games often linger on violence against the female protagonist or sexualize her in ways that overshadow her personal goals. The result, as one critic put it, can feel like watching a “chew toy in the mouth of a sadistic…god,” with the character forced through trauma without real agency . Below are notable examples:

Crystal Dynamics / Square Enix – Tomb Raider Reboot Series (2013–2018)

The Tomb Raider reboot (2013) and its sequels (Rise of the Tomb Raider in 2015, Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018) reinvented Lara Croft with a more “realistic” tone, but drew criticism for the way they depict her hardships. Executive producer Ron Rosenberg stated the intent was to make Lara “someone the player feels motivated to protect” . He explained that players don’t project onto Lara so much as think “I want to protect her”, positioning the (presumed male) player as a helper who watches her struggle  . In Rosenberg’s words, “just when she gets confident, we break her down again”  – indeed, the reboot puts Lara through imprisonment, a near-rape scene, and countless injuries, “literally [turning] her into a cornered animal” to force her evolution  . Critics have pointed out that Lara’s suffering is depicted with “gritty realism” and even a “perverse relish” at times . Unlike male heroes (e.g. Nathan Drake) who shake off injuries, Lara in these games is framed as a traumatized victim – “always the victim suffering at the hands of a more powerful aggressor”, even reacting to minor falls with cutscenes of pain  . As journalist Yahtzee Croshaw observed, the focus seems to be on making the player want to shield Lara, which ironically echoes the old objectification of the 1990s Lara: “whether you’re supposed to want to protect them or fuck them, the emphasis is on what you want, not what she might want”, i.e. the character’s own agency . In short, the Tomb Raider reboot’s overemphasis on Lara’s suffering and vulnerability has been seen as a modern twist on a classic male-gaze trope – shifting her from a sex object to a victim object, rather than a fully agentic hero  .

Naughty Dog / Sony – The Last of Us Part II (2020)

Naughty Dog’s critically acclaimed The Last of Us Part II also faced critiques for the brutal journey of its female protagonist. The game puts Ellie through a gauntlet of violence and trauma in her quest for revenge. While Ellie is ostensibly driven by her own goal (vengeance for Joel), some commentators felt the narrative contrives to maximize her pain. In contrast to Joel’s arc in the first game – where Joel “is almost always to some extent the architect of his own situation” – Ellie in the sequel often feels like “a victim of contrivance” . One analysis noted that, like Lara Croft and Amicia (from A Plague Tale, below), Ellie seems to exist to suffer: “forced through the most traumatic course of events possible” by the story, facing random collapses of structures, surprise attacks, and incessant misfortunes outside her control . While Ellie does make the key choice to pursue revenge, her characterization is often reactive. As Yahtzee wrote, “Ellie acts purely for Joel’s sake and her own personal desires in life are barely evident”, and she’s afflicted by “a bad case of the have-tos” – doing things because the plot demands it, not out of true personal agency  . The violence is framed to emphasize her torment rather than empowerment. This has led to debate about whether the game’s grim portrayal of Ellie crosses into “trauma porn.” Even some fans noted discomfort at witnessing a beloved character endure such relentless brutality with little relief. (By contrast, Naughty Dog’s Uncharted: The Lost Legacy – see Category 2 – would later be praised for letting its female leads have a fun, agency-driven adventure without such excess darkness.)

Asobo Studio / Focus – A Plague Tale: Innocence (2019) & Requiem (2022)

The Plague Tale series stars Amicia de Rune, a young woman navigating a grimdark medieval France overrun by plague and swarms of supernatural rats. These games have been highlighted alongside Tomb Raider and TLoU2 as part of a trend of “female-led triple-A games” that fixate on graphic violence and horror inflicted on their heroines  . Amicia is repeatedly beaten down by tragedy: witnessing family members murdered, protecting her little brother Hugo through gruesome ordeals, and suffering injuries and trauma throughout. Like Lara and Ellie, Amicia often survives by desperation rather than mastery – always outmatched by cruel circumstances. Critics noted that A Plague Tale frames much of its tension around Amicia’s vulnerability (she’s typically armed with only a sling and limited resources), making her feel constantly endangered. Yahtzee Croshaw explicitly grouped “the Plague Tale games” with Tomb Raider and Hellblade as titles where the female protagonist “gets the absolute shit kicked out of [her]” in a way male heroes in similar games usually don’t  . While the narrative gives Amicia moments of resilience, the lingering images of her suffering (injuries, emotional breakdowns, etc.) led some reviewers to call the experience “bleak” and “punishing.” The voyeuristic element is less sexual here and more about lingering trauma: the camera often dwells on Amicia’s panic or pain to drive home the darkness of the story. This relentless adversity, with Amicia as a beleaguered protector, has drawn criticism for crossing from empathetic storytelling into arguably wallowing in the heroine’s misery.

Ninja Theory – Heavenly Sword (2007), Enslaved: Odyssey to the West (2010), Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (2017)

Ninja Theory’s early and mid-2010s titles, despite featuring strong female leads, have been critiqued for subjecting them to “constant physical punishment from the narrative” under the guise of drama . In Heavenly Sword, the warrior Nariko is physically powerful, yet the story “punishes” her with a sacrificial ending – she wields a cursed sword that ultimately kills her after she saves the day . As one critic noted, this narrative suggests that Nariko “finds peace in death” because no one showed her respect in life, a conclusion seen as a “particularly sexist” twist for an otherwise strong female character . Meanwhile, Nariko’s ally Kai is “really tortured and traumatized” within the story , highlighting how even secondary female characters in the game suffer extreme emotional damage. In Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, the female co-lead Trip is essentially a damsel mechanic – she places an obedience headband on Monkey (the male protagonist) so that he is forced to protect her, or else he dies. The game then frequently puts Trip in peril; her “utter helplessness” is a core gameplay element  . Critics argued that Ninja Theory has a “shtick” of giving its female characters tragic backstories and then continually brutalizing them to signal depth . Even Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, acclaimed for its portrayal of mental illness, follows this pattern. Senua is brutalized both mentally and physically – the game unflinchingly depicts her psychosis and suffering. While it was intended to humanize her struggle with trauma, some saw it as “torture” akin to Lara Croft’s reboot journey . Senua’s quest (driven by her love for her deceased partner) is powerful, but she endures constant dread and pain at the hands of gods and visions. A critic in 2018 summed up Ninja Theory’s female leads this way: “tragic backstories and constant punishment… [as if] a character arc can be built just by making them suffer” . In all these cases, the female protagonist’s agency is limited – Nariko cannot escape her fate, Trip relies on Monkey for survival, and Senua is at the mercy of her hallucinations – and their stories seem designed chiefly to elicit pity or protective feelings from the player, rather than to let these women truly drive their destinies.

Quantic Dream / Sony – Heavy Rain (2010) and Beyond: Two Souls (2013)

David Cage’s narrative-heavy games have been criticized for how they handle their female protagonists, often exposing them to sexual threat or humiliation under the banner of “mature” storytelling. In Heavy Rain, one of the four playable characters is Madison Paige, a journalist. Madison’s segments are notorious for repeatedly placing her in scenarios that combine sex and violence, effectively turning her into a prop of titillation and danger. As one analysis noted, “all the scenes involving Madison have a tinge of sexual assault threatened on top of everything else”  . In Madison’s very first scene, the player is shown an extended shower sequence with lingering shots of her nude body (focusing gratuitously on her breasts) . Moments later, Madison is attacked in her apartment by intruders – a dream sequence, but one that establishes the perpetual threat of rape hanging over her arc . Throughout Heavy Rain, Madison remains a “constant target for sex, violence, and the combination thereof” . She never gets much character development (her skills or backstory are barely explored); instead, the game uses her to deliver “adult” content. In later chapters, Madison can be captured by a psychotic doctor who tries to drug and assault her (with a power drill as a phallic weapon), and in another scene she must strip at gunpoint to distract a club owner for information . Although the player can help Madison survive these ordeals, her agency is minimal – she’s reacting to threats the plot throws at her, always on the back foot. As critic Denis Farr put it, Madison is “defined in narrow, gendered terms”: the game never lets her proactively solve problems except by using or overcoming her sexuality . Tellingly, David Cage defended Madison’s early nude scene by saying, “You saw her really fragile and vulnerable and naked… then you can really start to like her as a character” . This quote encapsulates the issue: the game equates sympathy for Madison with seeing her exposed and victimized, rather than building her up through her own personality. Quantic Dream’s next title, Beyond: Two Souls, stars Jodie Holmes (portrayed by Ellen Page). Jodie’s story also subjects her to grim experiences – from childhood trauma in a lab to homelessness, and an attempted sexual assault in a bar (if the player makes certain choices). While Jodie has more agency in the overarching narrative (thanks to her supernatural abilities), Cage still wrote scenarios that many felt were voyeuristic or needlessly exploitative. The pattern in both games reflects an outdated trope: using sexual violence and suffering as shorthand for “mature” storytelling for female characters. This trope garnered substantial criticism for reducing otherwise promising heroines to vehicles of trauma, rather than allowing them full autonomy.

Nintendo – Metroid: Other M (2010, Team Ninja/Nintendo)

Nintendo’s Metroid series traditionally portrayed its legendary heroine Samus Aran as a capable, independent bounty hunter. This made 2010’s Metroid: Other M a shock to many, due to its drastic change in Samus’s characterization. Developed with Team Ninja, Other M presented Samus as emotionally insecure, deferential to a male superior, and curiously helpless in situations where she never was before. Critics were dismayed that one of gaming’s first empowered female protagonists was “reduced to a child-like state of obedience” . In Other M’s storyline, Samus freezes up in fear upon encountering her old nemesis Ridley, and she refuses to use much of her powerful gear until her former commanding officer (a father figure, Adam) authorizes it – a plot device that literally strips Samus of agency she previously always had. As one reviewer put it, the game’s script “characterizes her as scared and subservient”, which was “truly disheartening” to see . The portrayal of Samus in Other M was widely panned as betraying the empowered image she earned in earlier games. The developer’s attempt to give “emotional depth” backfired by making her seem weak and needing approval from a man. This sparked discussion on how not to handle a strong female character. (Notably, the backlash was so severe that Nintendo largely ignored Other M in future Metroid lore; years later, Metroid Dread (2021) deliberately returned Samus to form as a mute, resolute hero who takes her power – see Category 2.)

Square Enix – The 3rd Birthday (2011)

While not as high-profile as the above, The 3rd Birthday (a 2011 spin-off of the Parasite Eve series) is an infamous case of voyeuristic framing of a female protagonist. Developed by Square Enix, the game turned the beloved heroine Aya Brea into what critics called a “fragile and sexualized” shell of her former self . The developers implemented a “clothing damage” system where Aya’s outfit gets shredded as she takes damage, exposing skin; inevitably, during tough fights players will see Aya running around in tatters or underwear  . There’s even a secret unlockable “butt camera” mode that zooms the view in on Aya’s backside while playing . All of this serves no gameplay purpose except titillation. The game also indulges in scenes of Aya moaning in pain or exhaustion, including a gratuitous shower scene with erotic noises  . In combat and cutscenes, Aya is frequently shown gasping, stumbling, and crying, on her “last legs” to really hammer home her vulnerability . One review noted this portrayal effectively “made Aya into a sex symbol”, undermining the strong, capable character she was in previous titles . To unlock the “ass cam”, players even have to watch the shower scene 10 times in a row – a requirement that makes the developers’ prurient intentions quite clear . Beyond the sexualization, the narrative of The 3rd Birthday treats Aya horrifically (in plot twists, Aya is killed and body-swapped, and the player must literally shoot her in the final scene) . Fans and critics alike were appalled that a once-respected heroine was “treated so horribly”, finding it “agonizing and frustrating to watch Aya” be demeaned this way . This game is often cited as a worst-case scenario of a female protagonist written with no regard for her dignity or agency, existing only to excite the male gaze and to suffer for shock value  .

Summary of Category 1: In these AAA examples, the common thread is that the female protagonist’s own wants and motivations take a backseat to the experience of her suffering. Whether it’s physical harm, sexual objectification, or narrative contrivances that victimize her, the emphasis is on how we (the audience/player) feel – be it protective, aroused, or shocked – rather than on respecting the character’s autonomy  . As critic Yahtzee noted, this trend often stems from writers mistaking trauma for depth: they fall back on the idea that “suffering lends a character depth” without actually giving the heroine personal goals or growth beyond enduring pain . The result can be one-dimensional: a heroine defined chiefly by what she survives, not by what she strives for. This has prompted pushback in recent years and a call for more empowering depictions – which leads us to the next category.

Female Protagonists with Agency, Autonomy & Narrative Depth

In contrast to the above, many games in 2005–2025 have offered female leads who are portrayed with genuine agency and complexity. These protagonists make meaningful choices, pursue goals that matter to them, and are not primarily framed as objects of suffering or lust. Crucially, these games prove that having a woman in the leading role can be compelling without resorting to old tropes. Below, we highlight titles (AAA and indie) that are frequently praised for positive portrayals of female protagonists, along with what sets them apart.

Valve – Portal (2007), Portal 2 (2011) and Half-Life: Alyx (2020)

Valve’s games have been lauded for normalizing female protagonists in genres traditionally led by men. Portal introduced Chell, a silent protagonist who is simply there – the game never comments on her being female, nor sexualizes her in any way. Instead, Chell’s identity is conveyed through her actions (problem-solving, resilience) as she outwits the AI GLaDOS. This lack of fuss about gender was refreshing; as feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian noted, “it’s valuable to play in the shoes of women,” and she praised Portal (alongside Gone Home and Mirror’s Edge) for putting players in a female protagonist’s role naturally . Portal 2 continued this with Chell, again focusing on wit and perseverance. Later, Valve’s Half-Life: Alyx put a female character (Alyx Vance) at the forefront of a major FPS title. Alyx is depicted as a capable freedom fighter battling aliens – she cracks jokes, shows ingenuity with her gravity gloves, and drives the story forward by her determination to save her father. Like Chell, Alyx is not defined by trauma or overt sexualization; the narrative treats her as a full-fledged hero. The success of these games demonstrated that a female lead can be the default hero without alienating players or needing justification. As Sarkeesian said, “Gone Home was so powerful to so many of us because we saw our stories in a way we never have before”   – similarly, playing as Chell or Alyx simply lets players (male and female alike) inhabit a woman’s perspective, which was rare in mainstream games prior to this era.

Guerrilla Games / Sony – Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) & Horizon Forbidden West (2022)

The Horizon series is often cited as a breakthrough in its portrayal of a strong female hero. Protagonist Aloy is a young huntress in a post-apocalyptic world of machines, and her story is driven by curiosity, courage, and self-determination rather than victimhood. Critics have lauded Aloy as “a feminist protagonist who is empowered by her agency”, existing in a world that treats men and women equally  . Notably, Aloy’s design rejects the male gaze: she is not sexualized at all – she wears practical tribal armor and the camera never leers at her body  . This deliberate design choice was praised for avoiding the common pitfall where a heroine’s sex appeal eclipses her character (one study cited in a Horizon review noted that seeing a heroine objectified correlates with viewers holding less egalitarian views ). In Horizon’s case, Aloy’s appeal comes from her competence and compassion, not her looks. The narrative gives her full agency: Aloy chooses to leave her adoptive father figure to enter the Nora tribe’s Proving (a coming-of-age trial) of her own accord, and when asked to dedicate her success to someone, she can choose to dedicate it to herself, confidently asserting “This is for me, for all I did to get here”  . This moment, a small player choice, powerfully underlines Aloy’s self-driven nature and was highlighted as “a simple, assertive choice – affirming her sense of agency” that foreshadows the game’s feminist qualities  . Throughout her journey, Aloy is proactive: she seeks answers about her mother and the world’s ruin, and ultimately takes on the role of savior because she decides to, not because she’s forced. Moreover, Horizon’s world is matriarchal in her tribe and features many other women in authority (the Nora Matriarchs, warriors like Chief Sona, etc.), normalizing female leadership  . People in the game rarely remark on Aloy’s gender; she’s respected as a skilled Seeker and problem-solver first and foremost . By portraying a woman who is strong because of her abilities and convictions – and letting her have emotional range (she can be brave, angry, gentle, humorous) – Horizon set a high bar. Critics called Aloy an example of how to do a female hero right: she’s a “strong person, rather than a Strong Woman”, meaning her strength isn’t treated as unusual – it’s just part of who she is in a world where that’s normal .

Ubisoft – Assassin’s Creed (Series), Beyond Good & Evil 2 (upcoming)

Ubisoft’s track record with female protagonists has been mixed, but in the late 2010s they delivered some fan-favorite women leads who exemplify agency. Assassin’s Creed Syndicate (2015) featured Evie Frye as a co-protagonist (with her twin brother Jacob). Evie is depicted as the more level-headed, skilled assassin of the two, and many players enjoyed her segments for allowing a different style (stealth and intellect) to shine. Although Evie shared screen time, her portrayal was competent and not sexualized (Victorian assassin attire, no weird camera angles). Next, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (2018) allowed players to choose Kassandra or Alexios as the hero. Notably, Kassandra was intended to be the sole protagonist – the developers wanted her to be the only choice, but Ubisoft’s executives intervened, fearing a single female lead might hurt sales  . Despite this, Kassandra’s characterization stood out. She is witty, bold, and emotionally nuanced; the writing treats her as the canonical hero (in novels and DLC she is canon). Kassandra makes her own way as a mercenary in Ancient Greece, and she isn’t defined by romance or trauma (even when she has tragic family events, she responds with her own resolve). Players and journalists often cite Kassandra as one of the best protagonists in AC, period, for her charisma and the freedom with which she tackles the story. A report later revealed that the inclusion of Alexios was mandated by a (now ousted) creative officer who claimed “games with women leads wouldn’t sell” . The irony is that Kassandra ended up immensely popular, effectively disproving that bias. Ubisoft also gave us Aveline de Grandpré in Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation (2012, a smaller title). Aveline, a Black French woman in 18th-century New Orleans, had a unique narrative tackling slavery and social inequity. She had autonomy to shape her approach (even using different personas – lady, slave, assassin – to infiltrate, highlighting agency in how she navigates her world). While Liberation was not as high-profile, Aveline is remembered as a milestone: the first Black female protagonist in a big franchise, handled with respect. Beyond the AC series, Ubisoft’s long-teased Beyond Good & Evil 2 (in development) is expected to bring back Jade (the heroine from 2003’s Beyond Good & Evil) or feature a new female lead – Jade from the original was a great example of an early empowered female hero (a brave investigative reporter/fighter) that fans hope to see continued. Lastly, it’s worth noting that after internal reforms post-2020, Ubisoft has pledged more diversity in leads; the positive reception to characters like Kassandra and Evie likely encourages them to continue creating female protagonists with full agency.

Naughty Dog / Sony – Uncharted: The Lost Legacy (2017)

After subjecting Ellie to a harrowing tale in TLoU2, Naughty Dog showcased a lighter, more empowering adventure with two women at the helm in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. This standalone title stars Chloe Frazer (a fan-favorite thief from earlier Uncharted games) alongside Nadine Ross (a tough ex-mercenary). Here, Naughty Dog shifted gears: Chloe and Nadine quip, bicker, and bond as they cooperatively drive the story, hunting for a treasure in India. The tone is much more fun and classic-pulpy compared to TLoU2’s grimness. Chloe is resourceful and witty, and crucially, she’s never placed in a position of voyeuristic peril. The game’s action scenes treat her just as they would have Nathan Drake – she gets into scrapes and fistfights, but always with agency and often initiating the plan herself. Nadine, similarly, is portrayed as capable and strong (she was even an antagonist in Uncharted 4, known for outsmarting Drake). In Lost Legacy, neither woman is reduced to a love interest or a damsel; in fact, the story passes Bechdel Test-style metrics easily, as the two talk about strategy, their pasts, and mutual respect. Critics appreciated that Lost Legacy allowed its female leads to simply be badass treasure hunters in their own right, proving the formula works without a male lead. The developer admitted it was an experiment to see if the franchise could carry on with new protagonists – and it succeeded, with reviews praising Chloe and Nadine’s chemistry and independence. This game stands as an example of giving women characters the spotlight in a traditionally male-led genre (globe-trotting action) without making their gender the point. As a result, players engage with Chloe and Nadine as characters first, enjoying their growth (Chloe overcomes some personal demons about her father, Nadine learns to trust again after a betrayal in UC4) without any sense that they are being objectified or unduly tortured by the narrative. It’s simply a refreshing, agency-rich romp led by two confident women.

Telltale – The Walking Dead: Season 2 (2014) & Season 4: The Final Season (2019)

In the realm of episodic adventure games, Telltale’s The Walking Dead series made a huge impact with Clementine. In Season 1 (2012) Clem was a child NPC the (male) player character protected, but by Season 2, Clem becomes the playable protagonist – at only 11 years old. This was a bold choice that paid off: players now had to guide a young girl through apocalyptic hardships. Importantly, Clementine is written with immense depth and agency despite her youth. The game forces her to make hard choices (where to go, whom to trust, how to handle group conflict), giving the player a sense of responsibility and empowerment through her eyes. Clem’s arc across four seasons is one of growth from innocent girl to hardened survivor and eventually a caretaker for another orphaned child in the final season. Unlike many AAA heroines, Clementine’s trauma is not exploitative; it’s integral to a coming-of-age story. We see her mourn, cope, and harden, but also retain hope and kindness, which are choices the player can make. By the final season, Clem is effectively the leader of a group of kids – a position she earns through her own decisions. Critics celebrated Clementine as one of gaming’s best female characters because she feels like a real person, shaped by tragedy but not defined only by it. Telltale never sexualizes Clem (obviously given her age), and even when she enters a teenage romance in the final season, it’s depicted with a gentle, respectful touch focusing on emotional connection rather than physical. Through Clementine, The Walking Dead delivers a narrative where a female protagonist’s agency is paramount: the player is Clementine, deciding who she becomes. This level of identification and autonomy, especially in a genre about moral choices, was groundbreaking with a young female lead. It showed that players would just as readily step into the shoes of a little girl as a burly man if the storytelling is strong – and indeed many found it even more compelling.

Dontnod / Deck Nine / Square Enix – Life is Strange series (2015–2021)

The Life is Strange games (by Dontnod Entertainment and later Deck Nine) are celebrated for focusing on young female protagonists dealing with personal and social issues, giving them full narrative focus in a way rarely seen before. The original Life is Strange (2015) centers on Max Caulfield, a shy 18-year-old photography student who discovers she can rewind time. Max is not a typical “hero” by action game standards, but her agency comes through the choices she (the player) makes in relationships and pivotal moments. The game is fundamentally about Max’s emotional journey – reconnecting with her best friend Chloe, facing her fears, and taking responsibility for the consequences of altering time. Critics praised that Max felt like a real teenager, and the story explored themes of identity, friendship, and even LGBTQ romance (the player can shape Max’s romantic feelings towards Chloe). Rather than trauma for shock, Life is Strange uses trauma in a thoughtful way – e.g. the fate of Chloe or other students depends on Max’s decisions, and Max actively works to prevent tragedies using her agency. The prequel Before the Storm (2017) and sequel seasons (Life is Strange 2 shifts to male brothers, True Colors (2021) returns to a female lead, Alex Chen) continue the trend of character-driven narratives. Life is Strange: True Colors features Alex, a young Asian-American woman with empathic powers, carving out a place in a new town and uncovering a mystery. Alex, like Max, has autonomy in how she responds – players choose her dialogue, her love interest (male or female), and crucial decisions. The series has been lauded for avoiding stereotypical depictions: these girls and women are not one-note “strong female characters,” but multi-faceted individuals with interests, flaws, and growth. They are rarely sexualized (unless on the character’s own terms, like Chloe’s punk style is her expression, not for the player’s gaze). While serious topics (bullying, suicide, grief) appear, the framing is empathetic rather than exploitative. The games invite players to understand the protagonists’ inner lives. As a result, Life is Strange attracted a large female audience and proved that games about teenage girls could achieve both critical and commercial success. The commentary around the series often emphasizes how novel it was to see ordinary young women centered in an interactive story – a sign of progress in representation.

Remedy / 505 Games – Control (2019)

Remedy’s Control put a woman (Jesse Faden) front-and-center in a genre blending action, horror, and sci-fi – a notable first for the studio known for male-led games like Max Payne and Alan Wake. Jesse Faden is portrayed as a confident, proactive protagonist who arrives at the Federal Bureau of Control to search for her missing brother and ends up becoming the Bureau’s Director. Right from the start, Jesse demonstrates agency: she enters the eerie Oldest House of her own will, solves puzzles, and bonds with a supernatural Service Weapon that chooses her as its wielder. Throughout Control, Jesse is rarely a victim; instead, she gains power steadily (telekinetic abilities, levitation), and the narrative frames her as rising to meet challenges. In fact, as one article noted, “you don’t feel as powerless as you do in other games [horror games]. As Jesse’s list of weapons and abilities grows, she slowly becomes the most scarily powerful thing in the room.” . This inversion is key – Jesse starts as an “outsider,” but through her decisions and growth, she takes control (literally becoming the Director). Remedy also made a point to populate the game with other women – the head of research (Emily Pope), the enigmatic Former Director’s secretary, a rogues’ gallery of female characters – ensuring Jesse is not an isolated token female, but part of a world where women exist at all levels  . Narrative designer Brooke Maggs even commented that she loved how Jesse “is not the only woman in the game… When we can move away from there being a ‘main female protagonist’ in a world full of male characters, we’re moving further forward.”  . Furthermore, Control manages to avoid objectifying Jesse: her outfit is a simple leather jacket and pants; the camera never sexualizes her. The storytelling is focused on the mysterious plot and Jesse’s internal monologue (we often hear her thoughts, showing her determination and doubts). By letting us hear Jesse’s voice and giving her control over events, the game builds a connection that’s about understanding and empowering the character, not pitying or leering at her. Control was widely praised for its gameplay and narrative, and Jesse Faden stands as a modern example of a female lead who owns her story – she becomes the hero because she seizes the opportunity and earns her leadership, all on her own terms.

Nintendo – Metroid Dread (2021)

After the misstep of Other M, Nintendo redeemed Samus Aran with Metroid Dread. In this 2D action title, Samus is back to being the silent, fearsome bounty hunter. The game emphasizes her competence and autonomy at every turn. She’s on a mission she chose (investigating a distress call), and even when facing terrifying E.M.M.I. robots or deadly aliens, Samus is depicted as composed and formidable. One standout moment (widely cheered by fans) is when an enemy that earlier had overwhelmed Samus tries to scare her later in the game – and Samus doesn’t even flinch, calmly charging a shot and making the creature back down in fear. This is visual storytelling of her agency and courage. Metroid Dread also gives Samus an expressive body language despite no dialogue: we see her frustration, resolve, even a protective fury at one point – all emanating from her own drive, with no one ordering her around. By the end, Samus taps into a new power that makes her practically unstoppable, reinforcing the feeling that she decides her fate. Nintendo’s course correction here was noted by critics and fans as a recognition that Samus works best as a character when she is independent and empowered, not hamstrung by emotional vulnerability that wasn’t originally there. Dread’s success reinforced how beloved Samus is as a strong female protagonist who leads rather than follows. It’s a case where listening to feedback (after Other M) resulted in a portrayal that avoids disempowerment entirely.

PlatinumGames / Sega/Nintendo – Bayonetta series (2009, 2014, 2022)

On the surface, Bayonetta might appear to belong in the first category due to her overt sexualization – she’s a leather-clad witch who uses her sexuality as a weapon, and the camera in these games often highlights her body during her acrobatic combat moves. However, Bayonetta is frequently cited by feminist critics as a unique case of a character who, while highly sexualized, retains complete agency and ownership of her sexuality. As game critic Katherine Cross argued, “Bayonetta’s presentation, while heavily sexualized, expresses her character in a way that separates her from the crowd of uninteresting portrayals of [heterosexual] women in gaming.” . Bayonetta is confidently in charge in every scene – she knows the camera (and the enemies, and the player) are watching, and she plays it up on her own terms, often with a wink and a domineering attitude. Rather than being a victim, Bayonetta is the one inflicting punishment on angelic foes, all while reveling in style. She never appears frightened or under someone else’s power; even when facing god-like adversaries, her swagger remains. Some describe her characterization as camp empowerment – a parody of male gaze tropes that Bayonetta herself controls. For example, one of her finishing moves has her strike a pose as a literal camera shutter clicks – she’s acknowledging and owning the camera’s gaze . This self-awareness turns what could have been objectification into a kind of performative empowerment. There is debate in the community (some feel Bayonetta is still largely designed to appeal to straight male players), but the key point is that within the narrative, Bayonetta has full agency. She’s never narratively punished for being sexual or female; in fact, her femininity and cheeky dominance are sources of her power. The games also pass the Bechdel Test in that Bayonetta has relationships and rivalries (with Jeanne, another witch) that aren’t about men at all. So while Bayonetta’s visual design is provocative, she stands as an example that a female protagonist can be both sexual and empowered if the framing gives her the control. As Cross noted, Bayonetta is “sexy, funny, ungodly strong, supremely confident” – qualities that make her a complicated but ultimately positive icon to many .

Indie & Niche Titles – Gone Home (2013), Celeste (2018), Mirror’s Edge (2008) and more

Outside the AAA sphere, numerous smaller titles have pushed the envelope by centering women with agency and avoiding harmful tropes:
	•	Gone Home (Fullbright, 2013) places the player in the shoes of Katie, a young woman returning to her empty family home and discovering what transpired in her absence. The game is essentially an interactive story where Katie freely explores and pieces together clues about her sister Sam’s coming-out and romance. Gone Home was revolutionary in that it told a deeply personal, female-centered story without any combat or voyeurism – it’s about understanding family and identity. Sarkeesian cited Gone Home as powerful because players “saw our stories in a way we never have before”, praising it for letting us simply be a girl experiencing an emotional journey  . The narrative treats Katie as a conduit to a broader story of two sisters and is thoroughly pro-woman in its themes (it’s often referred to as a feminist game). It proved that even a game about exploring a house and reading diaries can captivate players when the characters are authentic.
	•	Celeste (Extremely OK Games, 2018) features Madeline, a young woman who decides to climb Celeste Mountain while grappling with anxiety and depression. Celeste stands out for using gameplay as a metaphor for Madeline’s internal struggle – each death and retry is part of her learning to overcome her self-doubt. Importantly, Madeline has full agency in this story: it’s her choice to climb the mountain, and she eventually learns to accept parts of herself (literally reconciling with a dark doppelgänger representing her inner fears). The game does not introduce any external saviors or tormentors; Madeline’s challenge is self-imposed and self-overcome, which is a refreshing narrative for a female character. The portrayal of mental health is compassionate and shows growth without any exploitative trauma. (It’s also noteworthy that the creator later confirmed Madeline as a transgender woman, adding another layer of representation – though this isn’t explicit in-game, it enriches how we view her triumph over personal adversity .) Celeste earned praise for making Madeline both vulnerable and strong, with the message that overcoming adversity is about inner growth (as opposed to the external “torture” seen in Category 1) .
	•	Mirror’s Edge (EA DICE, 2008) introduced Faith Connors, a daring parkour courier in a futuristic city. Faith is a woman of color who runs, jumps, and fights her way through a totalitarian regime’s forces to save her family and expose the truth. The game’s design famously put the camera in first-person, showing Faith’s arms and legs in motion but never sexualizing her – you become Faith through the parkour mechanics. She’s portrayed as independent and skilled; although she’s pursuing her framed sister’s freedom (so, helping a family member), it’s Faith’s decision to risk herself for justice. Mirror’s Edge was applauded for its unique perspective and for giving us a rare Asian female protagonist in an action game. It avoided common pitfalls: Faith isn’t hypersexual (she wears functional athletic clothes), and while she takes knocks in the story, the focus is on her athleticism and bravery, not her pain. This game, like Portal, was one Sarkeesian pointed to as a positive example of playing as a woman in a first-person game .
	•	Transistor (Supergiant Games, 2014) features Red, a singer in a sci-fi city who loses her voice but wields a powerful sword (housing her partner’s consciousness) to fight back against forces overtaking the city. Red is another example of a female protagonist who, despite a personal loss (her voice, and presumably her lover’s body), takes charge of her destiny. The game is essentially her journey to save her city and avenge what she’s lost. Red doesn’t speak (since she literally can’t), but her personality shines through her actions and the narration from the sword. She’s artistic, determined, and self-sacrificing on her own terms. Transistor doesn’t objectify Red; her character design is stylish but not lewd, and the narrative centers on her emotional resilience and clever combat strategy. It’s a beloved indie that quietly reinforces that a woman can lead a story through atmosphere and action without any pandering.

Numerous other indie games – from Oxenfree (teen girl leads confronting a ghostly rift) to Night in the Woods (Mae, a young woman dealing with mental health and returning home) – have enriched the landscape with diverse female protagonists. These games often explore themes like mental illness, identity, and relationships from a female perspective, broadening what stories games tell. They generally succeed by handing the protagonist agency to make decisions (often dialogue choices or branching narrative) and by eschewing cheap exploitation. When trauma is present, it’s usually handled with nuance (for example, Mae in Night in the Woods has a backstory of college trauma, but the game is about her healing and reconnecting, not endlessly punishing her).

Summary of Category 2: Games in this category treat their female protagonists as people, not props. These characters have their own goals (e.g. Aloy seeking knowledge, Max Caulfield trying to save her friend, Jesse Faden finding her brother and mastering the Bureau). They often overcome adversity through personal growth or skill, not just sheer luck or someone rescuing them. When they suffer, it’s not for gratuitous effect and they maintain agency in how they respond. Sexualization is minimal or presented on the character’s own terms. Moreover, the surrounding narrative and world tend to respect the character: supporting characters and plot events acknowledge the heroine’s leadership and competence, and we often see other women in the world (indicating the developers didn’t view having a woman protagonist as a one-off gimmick). The result is richer storytelling. As one writer noted about Horizon Zero Dawn, by not sexualizing Aloy and making equality a given in the game’s world, the story “maintains credibility as an egalitarian, gender-equal game”  . Players can invest in these protagonists’ arcs not because we pity them or lust after them, but because we identify with their struggles and admire their agency. This is the kind of representation that many critics argue the industry needs more of.

Conclusion

From 2005 to 2025, the portrayal of female protagonists in games has evolved, swinging between two extremes. On one hand, some AAA titles (even very recent ones) fell into the trap of “maturing” their stories by amplifying the heroine’s suffering or objectification – essentially, rebranding the damsel in distress or femme fatale tropes in ostensibly new ways. On the other hand, many developers have demonstrated that female leads can carry games through strength of character, not intensity of victimhood. As the industry moves forward, there is growing recognition (and player demand) for the latter approach. Indeed, the success of games with empowered female protagonists – critically, commercially, and in terms of audience connection – shows that gamers are eager for women characters who are agents of their own fate.

The contrast outlined here also highlights a broader point often raised by critics: Who creates the game can influence how women are depicted. When writers rely on lazy tropes (sometimes due to lack of diverse perspectives on the dev team ), we get the Rosenbergs saying “break her down” or the Cage-style voyeurism. But when developers approach female characters as characters first – with the same variety of roles, flaws, and strengths historically given to male heroes – the result is far more engaging and progressive. As Anita Sarkeesian emphasized, seeing the world through the eyes of female protagonists is valuable, and it doesn’t detract from the experience – in fact, it can make stories feel fresh and inclusive .

In summary, the past 20 years have given us both discouraging examples of female leads stripped of agency and inspiring examples of female leads written with authenticity and respect. The trend in recent years leans thankfully toward more autonomy and depth. Games like Horizon, Control, Life is Strange, etc., have set a template for how to do it right. Meanwhile, the criticism leveled at games like Tomb Raider (2013) and The Last of Us Part II has sparked important conversations in the gaming community about avoiding voyeuristic trauma tropes. Moving into the future, developers and publishers appear to be taking these lessons to heart (e.g. Ubisoft’s internal changes, more women-led projects in the pipeline). The hope is that in the next 20 years, female protagonists won’t be a novelty at all – and when they star in games, it will be their story and agency that take center stage, not their suffering.

- Xbox One: April 11, 2018
- Nintendo Switch: April 11, 2019

- Topped European PlayStation Store charts at launch

Awards and Recognition:
- Multiple BAFTA wins including Best British Game, Best Performer (Melina Juergens), and Best Audio Achievement
- The Game Awards and D.I.C.E. Awards nominations across narrative and performance categories

Female Agency Analysis:
Senua’s journey might’ve started with good intentions—deep trauma exploration, mental illness representation—but it quickly turned into something closer to a psychological endurance marathon with no water stations. She’s less “troubled hero confronting inner demons” and more “sad sack stomping straight into horror with zero self-preservation instincts.” The game treats her trauma less like a burden to heal from and more like a themed rollercoaster that keeps looping until her brain turns to jelly. While our prior analysis noted her strength and resolve, the counterpoint pulls the curtain back and asks: if she’s so agentic, why’s she voluntarily diving headfirst into haunted villages dripping with blood like she’s late for a funeral? It’s less like she’s working through trauma and more like she’s seeking it out like it owes her money. In this lens, the game’s portrayal becomes less empowering and more masochistically performative.

Title: Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga (2024)

Developer: Ninja Theory  
Publisher: Xbox Game Studios  
Platforms: Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC  
Release Date: May 21, 2024

Total Players: Over 3 million players by November 2024

- Released Day One on Xbox Game Pass, boosting exposure
- Multiple award nominations for art, audio, and performance

Awards and Recognition:
- Game Awards wins for Best Audio and Best Performance
- Extensive BAFTA and D.I.C.E. nominations

Female Agency Analysis:
This sequel rips the Band-Aid off its own bloody forehead: Senua may be leading the way, but the path is suspiciously masochistic. Instead of confronting trauma, she seems to seek it out like it owes her money. Our original analysis called her story “a complex depiction of female agency.” The counterpoint? “Complex, maybe, but only in the sense that it’s complex why anyone would willingly go through that much spiritual and physical torture on purpose.” She comes off like the least-helpful voice in her own head, blithely ignoring common sense like “maybe don’t enter the murder-village with blood pouring out the door.” So while her agency technically exists, it feels more like a game mechanic than a character trait—she’s following the script of pain written by a god who hates her guts.

Awards and Recognition:
- Multiple BAFTA and VGX nominations
- Rise of the Tomb Raider won Best Action/Adventure Game (Game Critics Awards)

Female Agency Analysis:
Lara’s reboot arc was meant to be about growth and survival, but it often felt more like watching someone repeatedly fall down stairs for emotional points. She doesn’t make choices so much as endure consequences, acting not out of ambition or inner conflict, but because “she has to” (a phrase she might as well tattoo on her forehead). Our original analysis critiqued the constant trauma parade—this view dials it up, comparing it to being forced to protect a chihuahua with a death wish. She trips, falls, moans, bleeds, coughs, shivers, and apparently forgets to zip her coat on Everest. Agency, if it exists at all, is buried beneath layers of icy suffering, hand-wavy legacy nonsense, and one too many death-by-bamboo-through-the-chin cutscenes.

Developer: Asobo Studio  
Publisher: Focus Entertainment  
Platforms:
- Innocence: PS4, Xbox One, PC, Switch (cloud), PS5/XSX (2021)
- Requiem: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch (cloud)

Sales / Player Base:

- Requiem: 3 million players worldwide as of November 2023

Awards and Recognition:
- Requiem: Game of the Year nomination (The Game Awards 2022)
- NAVGTR, Webby, and BAFTA nominations across multiple artistic and performance categories

Female Agency Analysis:
Both games star Amicia de Rune, who may as well be strapped to a medieval trauma carousel. She stumbles through storm-wrecked ships, killer pigs, collapsing ledges, and every sadistic narrative twist you can imagine—all in the name of protecting her plague-powered little brother. Our original analysis noted Amicia’s actions as largely reactive, and this perspective takes it further: “She’s like a chew toy in the mouth of a sadistic god.” Her story is less “hero’s journey” and more “trial-by-fire with no exit ramp.” In Requiem, she’s tougher, more lethal, but the question remains: Is she choosing this path or just stuck on the rails of trauma escalation? If agency is making decisions that shape your arc, Amicia feels more like a passenger on a speeding misery cart someone else is driving.

Title: The Last of Us Part II (2020)

Developer: Naughty Dog  
Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment  
Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 (Remastered)  
Release Dates:
- PS4: June 19, 2020
- PS5 Remastered: January 19, 2024

Total Sales: Over 10 million copies sold by June 2022

Sales Highlights:
- Fastest-selling PS4 exclusive at launch (4 million in 3 days)
- Remastered version outperformed The Last of Us Part I’s launch in Europe
- Estimated $250 million in digital revenue from PS Store alone

Awards and Recognition:
- Game of the Year and 6 other wins at The Game Awards 2020
- Most Game of the Year awards for any single game in history
- BAFTA, D.I.C.E., and numerous critic accolades

Female Agency Analysis:
Ellie has the skills, the drive, and the knife—but does she actually have a say in her own story? Not really. She’s on rails, her arc less about choice and more about obligation. Our previous write-up framed her agency as compromised by trauma and narrative constraint, and this view goes for the jugular: Ellie acts “purely for Joel’s sake,” stumbling from one horrific event to the next like a grief-stricken NPC unable to respawn at home. Every choice she makes feels pre-scripted by the revenge-plot gods. She has the look of a protagonist but not the reins. By the end, she’s emotionally and physically shattered—and not because she evolved, but because the story demanded she disintegrate for maximum drama.

Title: Celeste (2018)

Developer: Maddy Makes Games (Extremely OK Games)  
Publisher: Maddy Makes Games  
Platforms: Windows PC, macOS, Linux, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia  
Release Date: January 25, 2018

Total Sales: Over 1.7 million copies on Steam as of 2024

Sales Highlights:
- Sold over 500,000 copies in 2018
- Surpassed 1 million by 2020
- $21 million in Steam revenue alone

Awards and Recognition:
- Best Independent Game and Games for Impact (Game Awards 2018)
- BAFTA nominations for Game Design and Original Property
- Critical darling across “Best of 2018” lists

Female Agency Analysis:
If Lara Croft is a chihuahua shivering in a snowstorm, Madeline is the woman who *chooses* to climb the storm. Celeste stands as the gold standard for female agency—not because Madeline doesn’t suffer, but because the game *asks why she suffers.* She’s driven by internal struggle, not narrative sadism. Every fall is hers. Every retry is hers. The “have-tos” in Celeste are unpacked and emotionally rooted, not hand-waved away with daddy issues or vengeance tropes. Celeste doesn’t just give her agency, it demands it. Her pain builds character—not pity.

Title: Bayonetta Series (2009–2022)

Developer: PlatinumGames  
Publishers: Sega (Bayonetta), Nintendo (Bayonetta 2 & 3)  
Platforms: PS3/4, Xbox 360/One, Wii U, Switch, PC

Total Series Sales:
- Combined: Over 7.6 million units as of March 2023
  - Bayonetta: ~3.7 million
  - Bayonetta 2: ~1.5 million
  - Bayonetta 3: ~1.1 million

Sales Highlights:
- Original title was Platinum’s best-seller at launch
- Bayonetta 2 underperformed commercially due to Wii U exclusivity
- Bayonetta 3 was the fastest-selling entry despite mixed critical reception

Awards and Recognition:
- Best Action Game wins at Game Awards 2014 and 2022
- Multiple perfect review scores from Japanese and Western outlets
- Consistent praise for combat innovation and art direction

Female Agency Analysis:
Bayonetta is what happens when a female protagonist is allowed to be in charge *and* aware of her own ass. Just grin as you slot her in the “actually has her shit together” column—sexy, competent, unbothered. Our analysis nodded at the empowerment vs. objectification debate; feel free to plow through (hush -- that's an apt way to put it) that wall and set up shop inside it: Bayonetta isn’t a sex object, she’s a *sex weapon*. Her combat, control, and style scream autonomy. There’s no sadistic trauma track, no choked-back sobs between battles. She commands the screen, knows it, and makes no apologies. Where other games beg you to protect their heroines, Bayonetta would laugh and step on your throat for the offer.

Title: Stellar Blade (2024)

Developer: Shift Up  
Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment  
Platforms: PlayStation 5 (April 26, 2024); Windows PC (June 2025 scheduled)

Total Sales: Over 1 million copies by June 2024

Sales Highlights:
- Topped charts in U.S., U.K., and Japan
- Earned $15.8M in royalties within two months
- Record-breaking launch for a debut IP from Korea

Awards and Recognition:
- Nominated for Best Action Game and Best Score at The Game Awards 2024
- Nominated for Action Game of the Year at D.I.C.E. 2025
- Generally favorable reviews (Metacritic avg: 81/100)

Female Agency Analysis:
Stellar Blade’s Eve may be the first protagonist in history to be overshadowed by her own backside—something Yahtzee notes by giving her “third billing behind her own bum cheeks.” Still, while the marketing focused on her latex-wrapped form, the actual gameplay paints her as competent, capable, and—shockingly—decisive. Our original entry called out the tension between empowerment and objectification. You can see the irony but also throws your hands up: why is it the sexy ones who actually *do* something with their lives? Eve may be walking fanservice, but she’s *walking* it with purpose. Compared to the moaning trauma-clones littering other AAA narratives, she’s at least on her feet—and making her own choices.

Total Sales: Over 24.3 million units as of April 2023

Sales Highlights:
- 7.6 million in first year

Awards and Recognition:
- BAFTA, D.I.C.E., and Game Awards nominations
- Won Outstanding Technical Achievement and Story (D.I.C.E. 2018)
- Best Storytelling and PS Game of the Year (Golden Joysticks)

Female Agency Analysis:
Aloy is the kind of protagonist you point to when someone says female characters don’t sell games. She’s not crying in a corner. She’s not being dragged through trauma mud. She’s out there scanning robot dinosaurs and solving world-ending tech conspiracies. Our original entry praised her as a modern benchmark for narrative agency. She likely deserves for you to at least throw her a begrudging nod. She’s not a chew toy for gods or a moaning guilt-bomb with a machete—she actually *does* things. Thinks. Plans. Learns. Her story arc is proactive, not reactive. She's not someone you protect. She's someone you follow… hopefully from a safe distance while she crafts explosives out of machine guts.

Title: Control (2019)

Developer: Remedy Entertainment  
Publisher: 505 Games (Remedy took over publishing in 2025)  
Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, PC, Switch (cloud), PS5, XSX, Stadia, macOS  
Release Dates:
- Original: August 27, 2019
- Mac: March 26, 2025

Total Sales: Over 4.5 million copies by late 2024

Sales Highlights:
- 2 million by December 2020

- Over 10 million players including Game Pass and giveaways

Awards and Recognition:
- Best Art Direction (Game Awards 2019)
- BAFTA, D.I.C.E., and SXSW nominations for performance, narrative, and direction
- GOTY picks from IGN and Game Informer

Female Agency Analysis:
Jesse Faden shows up at the Bureau of Control looking for answers, gets handed a talking gun, and becomes boss of an interdimensional bureaucracy in 30 seconds flat. If that’s not agency, nothing is. She’s emotionally reserved, sure—but that’s part of the point. Our original entry noted her competence and power, though some critics said her inner world wasn’t fully excavated. If a male feminist had her on the table (shut it, that's the way the AI compiling the titles to analyze framed it -- not me), he’d likely commend her for walking into cosmic chaos with the swagger of someone who doesn’t need flashbacks to justify being awesome. No moaning. No self-inflicted suffering spiral. Just a woman with a trench coat, telekinesis, and a “deal with it” attitude.

Publisher: Square Enix  
Platforms: PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Switch, Stadia  
Release Dates:
- Ep. 1: January 30, 2015
- Ep. 5: October 20, 2015

- 1 million by July 2015
- 3 million by 2017
- 5.7 million units on Steam alone

Awards and Recognition:
- Best Story (BAFTA 2016)
- Narrative and IP awards from D.I.C.E., SXSW, Golden Joysticks
- Performance of the Year (Golden Joysticks)

Female Agency Analysis:
Max Caulfield is soft-spoken, a little shy, and happens to control time. The entire premise is built on choices—how she rewinds, what she undoes, who she saves. Our analysis focused on narrative control and authenticity. The binary ending (whoops) may still be snark-worthy, but overall there's a game to appreciate where the protagonist isn’t being flung down a staircase of tragedy for “depth.” Max doesn’t suffer because fate demands it—she suffers because her own choices get complicated. That’s real agency. Bonus points for giving emotional weight to friendship and empathy, not just blood loss and explosions.

Publisher: The Fullbright Company  
Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, iOS  
Release Dates:
- PC: August 15, 2013

Awards and Recognition:
- Best Debut (BAFTA 2014, GDC 2014)
- Narrative and Innovation nominations at multiple events
- Game of the Year (Polygon 2013)

Female Agency Analysis:
Katie Greenbriar may not throw a punch or fire a gun, but she’s more agentic than half the sobbing protagonists in AAA. You might better approve of a protagonist who walks into a quiet house and—get this—leaves when she’s done. No ghosts, no trauma spiral, just exploration and personal truth. Gone Home lets the player drive the narrative. Katie’s agency comes from her curiosity and autonomy, not her ability to soak up damage. She doesn’t have to scream through a hallucination forest to be memorable. Sometimes, being still and asking questions is enough.

- Recognized for its unique blend of supernatural elements and teen drama.

Female Agency Analysis:
Alex may be the one holding the radio and making the decisions, but let’s not pretend she isn’t also the designated babysitter for a cast of emotionally stunned wet paper bags. The game lets you choose what she says and which ghost rift she wants to poke with a stick, sure—but most of her so-called “agency” involves navigating increasingly dramatic group therapy with supernatural lighting effects. It’s admirable that she’s not being fed into a trauma woodchipper like her AAA cousins, but the actual decisions here feel less like acts of empowerment and more like awkward stammering during a high school debate club séance. The ghosts are spooky, yes, but more memorable are the moments where Alex awkwardly tries to keep the party from collapsing under the weight of everyone's unprocessed emotions. A more grounded character? Yes. A fully autonomous one? Kinda. She’s not being hunted, just haunted by indecision—and maybe that’s progress.

Female Agency Analysis:
Mae Borowski has agency in the way a raccoon has agency when it knocks over your trash can—there’s clearly a goal, but you’re never entirely sure if it’s deliberate or just instinct. While other protagonists charge through warzones and ghost rifts, Mae drifts through dead-end conversations and late-night porch loitering. That’s the point, of course—but from a distance, it’s hard to tell if she’s making choices or just vibing until something breaks. The game frames her spiraling lack of purpose as a kind of low-key rebellion, but the big cosmic horror mystery seems more like an existential side quest than a catalyst for actual development. She talks, she wanders, she flirts with oblivion—but most of her “arc” is less about changing and more about eventually deciding not to jump off something tall. She’s not fighting trauma or embracing it—she’s sort of side-eyeing it while eating pizza in an alley, which, to be fair, is at least original.

I. CORRELATION BETWEEN FEMALE AGENCY AND COMMERCIAL SUCCESS

  1. High Sales & High Agency
     - Horizon Zero Dawn (24.3M+ units): Aloy’s autonomy, intelligence, and emotional range directly correlated with critical acclaim and massive sales; sequel funded easily.
     - Portal Series (20M+ est.): Chell’s silent, unsexualized competence defined Valve’s reputation for strong design, spawning Portal 2 and influencing future titles.
     - Life is Strange (20M+ players): Max’s emotionally grounded, agency-rich journey sold millions, won narrative awards, and launched multiple spinoffs and sequels.
     - Control (4.5M+ sold, 10M+ played): Jesse’s confident, high-agency narrative built Remedy’s first successful female-led IP; Control 2 now in production.
     - Celeste (1.7M+): Madeline’s internal agency resonated deeply despite indie scale; awards and sales fueled developer’s future projects.

  2. High Sales & Low/Undermined Agency
     - Tomb Raider Trilogy (38M+ total): Despite Lara’s reactive, trauma-centric arc, commercial success ensured three entries; but narrative fatigue ended reboot run.
     - The Last of Us Part II (10M+): Critical acclaim and massive sales despite Ellie’s constrained agency; no direct sequel announced, but HBO adaptation gained ground.
     - Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (6.3M+ players): Strong sales relative to budget, but success framed as tech/narrative innovation more than protagonist empowerment.
     - A Plague Tale Series (4M+ players total): Amicia’s reactive suffering sold well, likely due to strong visuals and sibling narrative, not heroine autonomy.

  3. Modest Sales & Strong Agency
     - Mirror’s Edge (1–2M est.): Faith’s high agency and unique gameplay praised, but low sales delayed sequel and prevented franchise expansion.
     - Gone Home (700K+): Katie’s narrative control lauded; financial success for a walking sim, but too niche to spawn major sequels.
     - Night in the Woods (550K+): Mae’s “drifting” agency resonated with critics, but modest sales limited developer’s commercial trajectory.

  4. Low Agency & Mixed/Declining Sales
     - Metroid: Other M (N/A, est. under 1M): Samus’s disempowerment alienated core fans; franchise paused until Dread course-corrected.
     - The 3rd Birthday (~250K est.): Aya’s extreme sexualization and loss of agency tanked fan goodwill and ended the series.

  5. Sexually Framed But High Agency
     - Bayonetta Series (7.6M total): Bayonetta’s agency and sexual self-control drew mixed critiques but consistent sales; franchise continues.
     - Stellar Blade (1M+ in 2 months): Eve’s objectified framing caused debate, but her active gameplay role and player control earned positive reviews and strong debut sales.

II. COMMERCIAL SEQUEL JUSTIFICATION ANALYSIS

  i. Direct Correlation (Agency → Success → Sequel)
     - Horizon, Portal, Life is Strange: Empowered heroines correlated with high sales, critical praise, and direct sequels/spinoffs.
     - Control: Protagonist with full narrative control fueled Remedy’s first internally-led IP sequel greenlight.

  ii. Inverse Correlation (Success Despite Low Agency)
     - Tomb Raider, TLoU2, Plague Tale: Heavy trauma narratives succeeded commercially but faced critical backlash; sequels launched but often with waning sales or narrative fatigue.
     - Hellblade II: Early sequel performance strong due to brand and tech, not protagonist appeal.

  iii. Niche or Indie Limitations
     - Games like Gone Home, Night in the Woods, and Mirror’s Edge showcased strong agency but hit commercial ceilings due to genre or marketing limitations, not character quality.

  iv. Sex-Sells vs. Control Debate
     - Bayonetta and Stellar Blade walked the line: sexualized design paired with mechanical agency. Success here suggests performative empowerment can sell—when backed by gameplay control.

III. CONCLUSIONS

  A. Commercially, female protagonists with high narrative agency *can* drive major AAA and indie success, particularly when gameplay and story cohere.
  B. Games with disempowered heroines *can* sell—but sustained critical scrutiny, declining sequels, or tone fatigue often follow (Tomb Raider, Plague Tale).
  C. High agency correlates positively with sequel justification *if* paired with either:
     - i. strong sales (Horizon)
     - ii. low-cost development (Celeste)
     - iii. awards and brand growth (Control)
  D. Conversely, games relying on voyeuristic or trauma-based framing (TLoU2, Other M, 3rd Birthday) may sell once, but undermine long-term franchise potential or reputational momentum.
  E. Agency matters—not just morally or politically, but *practically*—when building lasting IPs that resonate across markets and mediums.

How could I use that to decide how to handle female agency (in the story) in an indie game that contains much male-consumed gameplay and conventions?

I. CORE STRATEGIC GUIDELINE

  A. Balance Market Expectations with Narrative Integrity
     - Your indie game can include male-consumed conventions (combat, challenge, spectacle) while embedding a female protagonist with full narrative agency.
     - Prioritize giving the player control over how the protagonist engages with the world, not just how the world acts upon her.

II. APPLICABLE FINDINGS FROM AGENCY/SUCCESS CORRELATION

  1. Empowered Agency Does Not Undermine Genre Appeal
     - Example: *Control* proves that a female lead can thrive in supernatural FPS settings without softening tone or pace.
     - Application: Let your heroine make tactical decisions, steer combat, and dictate pacing—male players respond well to competency and authorship, not just fanservice.

  2. Internal Conflict Works if Volitional
     - Example: *Celeste’s* Madeline suffers, but it’s *chosen struggle*—not imposed suffering.
     - Application: Frame hardship as something your protagonist voluntarily faces (e.g. climbing a cursed mountain to break a spell she initiated), not as constant punishment.

  3. Avoid “Male Gaze by Accident”
     - Example: *Stellar Blade* walks a line; marketing oversexualized Eve, but gameplay restored her credibility through skill and decisiveness.
     - Application: If your visual design leans provocative, counterbalance it through control schemes and story beats that emphasize player agency, character wit, or domain mastery.

  4. Use Camouflage Story Structure
     - Example: *Bayonetta* uses genre excess to mask a feminist subversion—she owns her sexuality, she’s never reactive.
     - Application: You can use traditional power fantasy formats but let your heroine act as the *driver*, not just the avatar. Frame her flamboyance or badassery as *hers*, not the player’s to leech.

III. IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK

  i. DESIGN CHOICES
     - Dialogue Trees: Let players shape how she responds under pressure—sarcastic, empathetic, aggressive, etc.
     - Branching Missions: Include optional routes that only unlock through character-driven actions.
     - Combat Autonomy: Ensure the character initiates battle, selects weapons, sets the tone. Avoid scenarios where she’s passively thrown into violence or constantly rescued.

  ii. VISUAL + THEMATIC INTEGRATION
     - Avoid Fragility Signaling: Do not dwell on injuries, grunts, or “moaning through pain” unless narratively meaningful.
     - Treat Sexualization As Signal, Not Rule: If visually provocative, make it part of the character’s strategy or awareness—not passive display (see: Bayonetta’s wink).

  iii. NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION
     - Internal Motivation: Tie major plot turns to *her choices*, not her reactions to male characters’ actions.
     - Emotional Arc: Permit emotional range—anger, sorrow, joy, curiosity—but ground it in cause-and-effect built by *her actions*.

IV. FINAL DECISION TREE (INTERNAL USE)

  A. Does the protagonist’s goal originate from her own desire? If no, reframe.
  B. Does every major plot development involve her making a choice? If not, add decision beats.
  C. Is her pain visually emphasized more than her will or control? If yes, re-stage those scenes.
  D. Can the player look at a key game moment and say, “She did that,” not “That happened to her”? If not, revise.

V. CONCLUSION

  - Even in male-skewed genres, female agency enhances—not undermines—immersion and commercial appeal.
  - Your goal: empower the player *through* her, not *over* her.
  - Success lies in engineering a protagonist whose arc earns respect not just from critics, but from the hands gripping the controller.
