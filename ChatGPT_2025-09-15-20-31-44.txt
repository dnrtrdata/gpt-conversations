Use this list as a basis to search — seek out examples of documents that studios and producers use to evaluate screenplays, treatments, or pitches for value and marketability.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Studios and producers typically don’t rely on a single document to judge a project’s potential—they use a suite of narrative and analytical instruments to evaluate creative material. Drawing on the types of pre‐production documents that StudioBinder helps create, here are several key examples used to assess screenplays, treatments, or pitches for both creative value and marketability:

1. Script Coverage Reports

These are detailed written analyses of a screenplay. A typical script coverage report includes:

Vital Information: Title, author, genre, and estimated budget.

Logline and Synopsis: A one- to two-page summary of the story.

In-Depth Comments: Critical feedback on elements like character development, plot structure, pacing, dialogue, and overall storytelling.

Rating or Recommendation: Often using a simple scale (e.g., “Pass,” “Consider,” or “Recommend”) to quickly communicate whether the script is production-ready.

Such coverage documents serve as a “first pass” for development executives to decide whether a script warrants further investment. For example, detailed coverage examples are available from industry services like Coverage Ink and even sample reports such as the ICM Script Coverage Sample provide insight into what producers look for (
coverageink.com
, 
screencraft.org
).

2. Film Pitch Decks

Pitch decks are visually engaging presentations designed to sell a project. A strong film pitch deck typically contains:

Compelling Imagery: Mood boards and style references that set the tone and visual identity.

A Clear Synopsis: A concise introduction to the film’s story and key characters.

Market and Financial Considerations: Information about target demographics, budget estimates, and franchise potential.

Successful examples include the original “Montauk” pitch deck (which evolved into Netflix’s Stranger Things) as well as various templates and case studies found on sites like Storydoc, Vicious & Co, and VIP Graphics (
storydoc.com
, 
vip.graphics
).

3. TV Show Bibles and Treatments

For television projects—and increasingly for films—a show “bible” or treatment is used to outline the full narrative vision. These documents generally include:

Extended Synopses: Detailed overviews of the series or film concept.

Character Bios and Arc Summaries: Descriptions that explain who the characters are and how they develop.

World-Building Details: Information on setting, tone, and visual style.

Future Development Plans: For TV, this may include episode outlines or season arcs; for films, potential franchise or sequel ideas.

These documents help executives quickly gauge whether the narrative has long-term potential and fits the studio’s market strategy.

4. Treatments

A treatment is a narrative document written in prose that outlines the story, character sketches, and sometimes even dialogue samples. It’s used both to secure initial interest and as a roadmap for further development. Treatments allow producers to:

Evaluate the Story’s Core Concept: Assessing the strength and originality of the idea.

Judge Marketability: Seeing how the project might resonate with audiences.

While shorter and less formal than a full script, a well-crafted treatment can be very persuasive in early pitch meetings.

5. Supporting Memos and Rating Grids

Often attached to script coverage or pitch decks, these tools provide a quick, quantitative assessment of key script elements (e.g., character, dialogue, structure, and pacing). They let busy executives rapidly compare multiple projects side by side.

Together, these documents form a robust evaluation system. They not only communicate a project’s artistic and narrative merits but also its commercial potential. By reviewing coverage reports, pitch decks, treatments, and supporting memos, studios and producers gain a comprehensive view of a screenplay’s strengths, weaknesses, and overall marketability.

For further details on these instruments, you might look at resources such as the Script Coverage Sample by Coverage Ink (
coverageink.com
) and various film pitch deck guides from sites like Vicious & Co (
storydoc.com
).

Thank you. Please try to find methods screenwriters have used to choose the most commercially viable of their ideas to pursue early in the process before they spend the time developing and writing.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Below is the updated, chronologically ordered two‑level hierarchical list. (Level 1 items represent documents or exercises used during the development process, and each Level 2 bullet point describes one distinct purpose. New entries have been added near the very beginning to capture methods screenwriters use to choose the most commercially viable ideas before committing to full development.)

Idea Evaluation Tools/Exercises

Use a “How‑To Book” exercise (writing a brief how‑to book from your protagonist’s perspective) to test whether the story’s lesson—and the sense of hope or empowerment it conveys—is universally appealing. (Example: Marilyn Horowitz’s method, as detailed in “From Story To Screenplay, Keeping It Commercially Viable”)

Conduct market research and trend analysis (using tools such as Google Trends, industry reports, or competitor studies) to determine if the idea aligns with current audience demands and successful genre trends.

Perform a SWOT analysis or use commercial viability checklists to objectively weigh the idea’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Test your logline or brief treatment with peers or online communities (for example, via r/Screenwriting) to gauge initial commercial interest and receive early feedback.

Benchmark your idea against successful spec scripts (such as those behind Get Out or The Social Network) to see if it meets industry standards for commercial appeal.

Story Outlines

Map out the overall plot and narrative structure early in the creative process.

Establish the sequence of key events that will guide development.

Example: Extensive outlines were instrumental in shaping films like The Dark Knight.

Treatments

Example: During its development, Inception used a compelling pitch deck to secure financing and studio backing.

Supporting Memos & Rating Grids

Offer quick, quantitative assessments of key script elements using standardized criteria (e.g., dialogue, structure, marketability).

Enable side‑by‑side comparisons with other projects to help refine the screenplay’s potential.

Example: Studios have used such grids internally (e.g., during the development of The Dark Knight) to objectively compare scripts.

Production Docs (Shared Production Notes)

Enable collaborative note‑taking and track creative decisions and revisions during pre‑production.

Serve as a central repository for communication between departments throughout production.

Example: Large-scale productions like The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King rely on shared production notes.

Facilitate logistical planning and ensure every element is accounted for during production.

Example: Films like Jurassic World and Inception use detailed breakdowns to manage complex shoots.

Script Sides

Isolate specific scenes for focused rehearsals or on‑set shooting.

Provide concise, scene‑specific instructions to actors and crew.

Example: Action sequences in films like The Avengers are often prepared using script sides.

Provide essential information (locations, contacts, etc.) for each shooting day.

Example: Blockbusters such as The Avengers issue call sheets to coordinate multi‑location shoots.

Location Documents

Record and manage details about shooting sites, including permits, logistical considerations, and scouting information.

Ensure all location‑related aspects are organized for smooth production operations.

Example: The Revenant depended on detailed location documents for managing remote and challenging locations.

Film Production & Release

Execute the actual filming, post‑production, and final editing of the project.

Manage distribution and the professional marketing process that brings the completed film to audiences.

Example: Inception and Get Out are films that underwent rigorous production management and professional release strategies.

Please format the following list in the same two-level hierarchy of our current list (but keep this list separate as its own entity): 

1. **Ordinary World** – Establish the protagonist in their normal life. Define their status quo, personality, and relationships. Introduce the world’s tone and mood.

2. **Unspoken Need** – Subtly reveal the protagonist’s deeper, often unconscious need. This need will drive their transformation.

3. **Inciting Disruption** – Introduce an external event or internal realization that shakes their normal world. This is the call to adventure.

4. **Hesitation & Doubt** – The protagonist struggles with the decision to act. They may deny, debate, or resist the call, fearing the unknown.

5. **Point of No Return** – The protagonist takes decisive action, stepping into the unfamiliar world. Their old life is left behind.

6. **New World, New Rules** – The protagonist explores this new reality, learning its challenges, dangers, and potential rewards.

7. **Promise of Change** – A moment of excitement or success convinces the protagonist that change is possible. They feel they are making progress.

8. **False Victory or Doom** – A major event at the midpoint shifts the story. The protagonist either thinks they have succeeded (false victory) or faces crushing failure (false doom).

9. **Escalating Consequences** – Opposition intensifies. Stakes rise. External forces and internal doubts push the protagonist toward their breaking point.

10. **Breaking Point** – Everything crumbles. The protagonist experiences a devastating loss, betrayal, or failure that forces total despair.

11. **Reckoning & Resolve** – In the darkness, they reflect, adapt, and find new determination. A lesson is learned or a truth is embraced.

12. **Final Trial** – The protagonist makes their ultimate push. They face their greatest challenge, where everything is on the line.

13. **Transformation & Triumph** – Whether through victory or failure, the protagonist is fundamentally changed. They act based on their growth.

14. **Return to the World** – The protagonist comes full circle, re-entering their old world—but as a changed person.

15. **Echo of Change** – A final moment or image that contrasts with the beginning, showing how far the protagonist has come.
