give me a word count on the following:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
We’re moving down a dark corridor.
Then, emerging from the darkness.
Ice blue eyes.
BOND cautiously moves through the tight hallway. Gun ready.
We have no idea where we are. We hear distant city noises
outside.
He rounds a corner.
At the end of hall: open door.
Dead body.
Bond picks up his pace. Gets to the door. Nudges it open.
Aiming.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Bond enters. Eyes take it in.
Scene of carnage. Another dead body. Euros scattered around.
Empty metal briefcase. Laptop, backed ripped off, hard drive
missing. Signs of struggle.
And a dying MI-6 agent on the floor. Gasping for breath. Eyes
pleading up at Bond.
Bond moves to him quickly, checks his pulse:
BOND
(on earpiece)
Ronson’s down. He needs a medical
evac.
A voice crackles through the darkness.
It’s M:
M (V.O.)
Where is it? Is it there?
Bond looks over to the laptop.
BOND
Hard drive’s gone.

if the excerpt is 1 page, give me 1/8 of a page, but make sure we're not cutting off a beat (defined as: "In filmmaking, a beat is a small amount of action resulting in a pause in dialogue. Beats usually involve physical gestures like a character walking to a window or removing their glasses and rubbing their eyes. Short passages of internal monologue can also be considered a sort of internal beat.")
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


To find 1/8 of the page without cutting off a beat, here's how the excerpt would break down while keeping the integrity of the action and beats intact:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
We’re moving down a dark corridor.
Then, emerging from the darkness.
Ice blue eyes.

BOND cautiously moves through the tight hallway. Gun ready.
We have no idea where we are. We hear distant city noises outside.

He rounds a corner.

This portion is approximately 1/8 of the text while ensuring no beats are cut prematurely. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!
