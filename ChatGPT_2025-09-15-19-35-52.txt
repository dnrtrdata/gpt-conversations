The provided Mermaid graph represents a hierarchical structure of game development concepts, but it can be made more modular and hierarchical by categorizing the related nodes more explicitly.

Here's an improved version of the graph with a more modular and hierarchical structure:

This structure creates clear subcategories under each main topic, making the graph more modular and hierarchical. You can use this structure to visualize the graph in a more organized manner.

It seems there was an issue generating the download link for the file. I will try saving it again to ensure you can download it properly.

Let's try saving the file again and provide the correct path.

To create the .mermaid file, follow these steps:

Open a text editor (such as Notepad, VS Code, or any editor of your choice).

Copy the content above and paste it into the text editor.

Save the file with the extension .mermaid (for example, improved_game_development_knowledge_graph.mermaid).

If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
