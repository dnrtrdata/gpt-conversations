Here are additional problem-solving benchmarks for Grades 3-5 (general & specific), pulled from the most current (as of mid-2025) Colorado and District 49 sources, plus verification notes. If you like, I can pull together a summary you can print or share.

What the State / District Say (Updated Info)
Colorado Academic Standards – Mathematics & Problem Solving

These are the parts of the standards that explicitly address problem solving, reasoning, etc., including “mathematical practices”:

Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Students should be able to understand the problem, find a path forward, try different strategies, check their work, perhaps revise or retry. 
Colorado Department of Education

Reason abstractly and quantitatively. This means they should understand what quantities are involved, what relationships are important, be able to move between concrete examples and abstract representations (e.g., symbols). 
Colorado Department of Education

Model with mathematics. Use real-world situations, represent them using mathematical constructs (graphs, equations, diagrams) to analyze and solve. 
Colorado Department of Education

Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Be able to explain why a particular solution makes sense, examine if other solutions are valid. 
Colorado Department of Education

From the Grade 3-5 math standards document specifically:

Students solve problems involving the four operations, including multi-step word problems. 
Colorado Department of Education
+1

Students should also be able to recognize patterns in arithmetic, use those to generalize or predict. 
Colorado Department of Education

District 49 Information

District 49 uses benchmark and interim assessments (Acadience Math, Star 360, Aimsweb Plus etc.) to monitor math growth and performance, which implicitly test problem solving via those items in the assessments. 
District 49

The district’s Academic Standards page confirms alignment with the Colorado Academic Standards; so the state’s problem solving / mathematical practices apply locally in Meridian Ranch Elementary & other district elementary schools. 
District 49

Specific Benchmarks / Milestones (Grades 3-5) for Problem Solving

Distill all this info into a single, comprehensive paragraph per grade level. Accomplish this with two drafts of the material:

Draft 1: Be surgically precise, academically-rigorous, and absolutely-clear in your descriptions and definitions within the confines of a single, logically-organized a meticulously/structured SINGLE PARAGRAPH-PER-GRADE-LEVEL CONSTRUCTED WITH COMPLETE SENTENCES at the highest required reading/writing-level (Master's/PHD et cetera); then...

Draft 2: convey the same info as it could be reasonably presented to each respective grade-level (describing 3rd grade info as a 3rd grader would likely understand it, 4th grade info at 4th grade level, etc cetera) within the same "one-paragraph-per-grade-level constructed of complete sentences, organized logically, et cetera" parameters.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Here are the two requested drafts, each providing a single, comprehensive paragraph per grade level. Draft 1 is written with maximum academic precision; Draft 2 is rephrased at each grade-appropriate level.

Draft 1: Graduate-Level, Academically Rigorous

Grade 3
By the conclusion of third grade, students are expected to demonstrate mastery of foundational number operations through fluent multiplication and division within 100, extend their place-value understanding to perform multi-digit arithmetic, and apply these skills to both single-step and multi-step contextual problems. They must also conceptualize fractions as numbers, compare fractional magnitudes, and employ measurement tools for time, volume, and mass while connecting geometric reasoning to area and perimeter. In literacy, third graders must read grade-appropriate literature and informational texts with sufficient fluency and comprehension, identify central ideas, supporting details, and thematic patterns, and articulate how narrative structures build cumulatively. Written production must include opinion, informative, and narrative compositions with logical sequencing, linked reasoning, and conclusions, while oral communication emphasizes active participation in discussions, narrative recounting, and the presentation of information with clarity and descriptive precision. Collectively, these benchmarks codify the expectation that students not only acquire procedural fluency but also engage in problem solving, model situations mathematically, and construct logical arguments across academic domains.

Grade 4
By the end of fourth grade, learners are required to extend computational fluency to include multi-digit multiplication and division by two-digit divisors, as well as the addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators and the initial integration of decimals. They must recognize and generalize arithmetic patterns, analyze geometric figures by properties and relationships (including angles, lines, and symmetry), and demonstrate facility in representing data and solving measurement problems involving volume and unit conversions. In literacy, they must read with comprehension across genres—including prose, drama, and poetry—while analyzing theme, point of view, and structural distinctions between text types. Their writing must exhibit greater sophistication in organization and transitions, integrating opinion, explanatory, and narrative modes with precise vocabulary and adherence to grammatical conventions. Oral communication expands to include effective collaboration, reporting of information, and adaptation of register to audience and purpose. Critical to the grade-level progression is the expectation that students employ multi-step reasoning strategies, justify solutions with coherent arguments, and apply problem-solving heuristics that extend beyond rote execution.

Grade 5
Fifth-grade standards require learners to attain competency with all four operations applied to fractions and decimals—including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—while also developing the capacity to interpret and compute with numerical expressions containing parentheses. Students must consolidate place-value understanding to the thousandths, perform operations with decimals to hundredths, and engage with concepts of volume, coordinate graphing, and classification of two-dimensional figures. Problem solving entails multi-step word problems incorporating fractions, decimals, measurement, and data representation, with an emphasis on selecting efficient strategies, modeling real-world contexts mathematically, and evaluating the validity of multiple solution pathways. In literacy, students are expected to independently comprehend and analyze complex texts, integrate information across multiple sources, and evaluate authors’ purposes and structures. Writing expectations include opinion essays supported by textual evidence, explanatory pieces with coherent structures, narratives with vivid detail, and the conduct of short research projects. Oral communication skills expand to encompass formal presentations, collaborative discourse, critique of reasoning, and adaptation of tone and medium. By the end of fifth grade, students should exhibit an integrated problem-solving disposition characterized by persistence, metacognitive monitoring, and the ability to defend reasoning across both mathematical and linguistic domains.

Draft 2: Grade-Appropriate Versions

Grade 3
By the end of third grade, you should know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers, and you should be quick with facts up to 100. You will also start working with fractions, like halves and thirds, and you will measure things such as time, weight, and liquid. In reading, you should be able to understand stories and information books, find the main idea and details, and tell how the story parts fit together. In writing, you will practice giving your opinion, explaining facts, and telling stories with a beginning, middle, and end. When you speak, you should be able to join group talks, listen to others, and share your own ideas clearly. Most importantly, you will practice solving word problems step by step, trying out different ways to figure them out, and explaining why your answers make sense.

Grade 4
By the end of fourth grade, you will be able to multiply bigger numbers, divide by numbers with two digits, and add and subtract fractions that have the same bottom number. You will also start to understand decimals, measure things like angles and shapes, and solve problems about area, volume, and data. In reading, you will read harder stories, poems, and plays, and you will explain the theme, point of view, and how the author builds the text. In writing, you will create opinion pieces, reports, and stories that have clear order, good transitions, and strong vocabulary, while keeping your spelling, grammar, and punctuation correct. In speaking, you will take part in group talks, share information clearly, and adjust how you talk depending on who is listening. A big part of this year is learning how to solve tougher, multi-step problems, check your work carefully, and explain your thinking.

Grade 5
By the end of fifth grade, you will be ready to add, subtract, multiply, and divide with both fractions and decimals, and you will know how to work with numbers in parentheses and decimals to the hundredths place. You will solve problems with volume, graph points on coordinate planes, and sort shapes into groups by their properties. In reading, you should be able to understand more difficult texts on your own, compare different authors and genres, and pull information together from different sources. In writing, you will work on opinion essays with evidence, reports with strong structure, stories with detail and description, and short research projects. In speaking, you will practice giving presentations, joining discussions, and using the right tone and style for your audience. Problem solving is a big focus: you will solve multi-step word problems, try out different strategies, and explain and defend why your answers make sense.

Do you want me to extend this same two-draft format into grades 6–8 so you have a continuous reference up through middle school (which often helps coaches/teachers plan progressions)?
