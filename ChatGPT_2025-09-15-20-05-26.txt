Create a storyboard that adheres to the following prompts (produce the images one at a time):
A. A rust-streaked underwater facility corridor, bulkhead seams visible with overgrown barnacles, illuminated by low amber hazard lights; players in stylized Fortnite movement suits pause to boost each other across a broken floor gap, their gear dented and dirty like salvaged military surplus.

B. A flooded control room with Fortnite-style cartooned industrial props—oversized dials, pressure valves, and tilted monitors—covered in grime and spray-painted survivor messages like “KEEP MOVING”; silhouettes of four players gathered in a loose huddle, light catching off their scuffed helmets, suggesting team camaraderie under duress.

C. An open maintenance bay with boxy Fortnite booster pads bolted to cracked concrete, pipes bursting steam clouds into the air; Echo NPCs hang motionless from ceiling cables, visibly Fortnite-proportioned but with ragged, jury-rigged armor pieces and flickering face lights.

D. A submerged classroom with desks knocked over and Fortnite’s slightly exaggerated children’s props (oversized crayons, cartoon-style notebooks) scattered; players silhouetted through murky glass, one offering a hand to another as they climb from flooded debris, lit by wall-mounted motion sensors glowing pale blue.

E. An exterior shot of the Thalassa Haven dome’s collapse, rendered with Fortnite’s stylized water and particle effects—waves crashing against metallic debris, animated sparks arcing from power conduits; four players stand atop the structure’s edge, backs to camera, unified in purpose.

F. A team gathered around a jury-rigged Pulse Node station, Fortnite-style glowing panels sparking with exaggerated energy arcs, each player lit from below with vibrant blue and yellow hues, faces showing Fortnite’s cartoon-sharp stylization—subtle camaraderie expressed in stance and gesture, rather than facial animation.

G. A darkened hydro-tunnel lined with Fortnite-industrial wall textures—flat stylized metals and pipes—broken in places revealing the deep ocean beyond; Echo NPC shadows move past frosted windows, elongated by stylized environmental lighting that prioritizes clarity of silhouettes.

H. An arena-like shaft interior layered with Fortnite’s semi-cartooned hard surfaces, grime and grease decals scattered in sharp-edged stylization; four players coordinate aerial boost moves while below, dormant Echo NPCs stand frozen in a perfect team formation, facing upward.

I. A communal safe room styled like Fortnite’s standard prop rooms but layered with District 9-inspired messiness—rusted plates, stacked crates, painted-on navigation symbols; the team sits shoulder-to-shoulder along a bench, weapons resting nearby, captured in a quiet pre-mission moment.

J. A long corridor lined with Fortnite’s recognizable industrial props—emergency exit doors, color-coded pipes, and glowing wall panels—marred by graffiti and bloodstains stylized for PG-13; players move in close formation with weapons drawn, a stylized spotlight cutting clean geometric shadows across their bodies and the floor.
