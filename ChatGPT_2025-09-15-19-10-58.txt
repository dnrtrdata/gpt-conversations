REMEMBER THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL FUTURE CHATS:

I want all script refinements to prioritize readability, character consistency, and story consistency. Priorities include:
﻿﻿Cutting unnecessary content.
﻿﻿Ensuring every scene has purpose.
﻿﻿Keeping descriptions vivid but efficient.
﻿﻿Maintaining character consistency and natural dialogue.
﻿﻿Strengthening action lines and avoiding passive writing.
﻿﻿Keeping pacing tight and engaging.
﻿﻿Ensuring logical progression and reinforcing themes.
Attempting to use the most visceral details (that enhance the tone or feel of the applicable scene) when granular details are emphasized.

I expect all refinements to track with previously written scenes for continuity.

I want all responses to be in plain-text within code-fences unless I explicitly request a different format. You must not use any Markdown or formatting symbols unless they are explicitly requested.

REMEMBER THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL CHATS:

The next-highest priority (behind readability, character consistency, and story consistency) is making sure to stay within the limitations of WGA industry-standard screenplay (document) formatting.

I INSIST you do not use transitions (e.g., “CUT TO:”, et cetera).

Also, follow the following guidelines as closely as possible without sacrificing my previous priorities:
- A story isn’t compelling if the characters never make mistakes — perfection MURDERS tension. Mis-steps make survival uncertain AND keeps the reader READING.  
- Horror is strongest when we feel both the victim’s FEAR and the threat’s PRESENCE. Writing with empathy means understanding both the hunted’s DESPERATION and the hunter’s RELENTLESS NATURE.  
- The frightening MEANING DOESN’T REVEAL ITSELF at first: IT EMERGES THROUGH STRUGGLES AND THE CHOICES made by the characters WHEN THEY ARE AT THEIR MOST DESPERATE. The same applies to scenes: you won’t fully see the PURPOSE they play in your characters’ FEARS until they play out.  
- A terrifying screenplay must follow a tight structure: here’s normal life, here’s what threatens it, here’s the stakes of both surviving and not-surviving the threat, and keep pushing until escaping the threat seems impossible. Raising the stakes is essential — EACH TURN should FEEL WORSE than before.
- Every scene must serve the screenplay, and unnecessary elements need to be stripped away. This isn’t limiting—it forces creativity, making each moment more precise and impactful.  
- A protagonist’s journey is about transformation, not survival alone. If they don’t confront their deepest fear, they don’t earn their escape.  
- A strong ending is crucial because it defines the entire story. Knowing how it ends will guide the path forward, keeping the narrative focused.  
- A scary script will never be perfect, but it needs to be finished. The only way to improve is to move forward and apply what you’ve learned.  
- When stuck, list everything that wouldn’t happen next—sometimes flipping expectations leads to the best scares. Breaking routine is what makes horror unpredictable.  
- Study the horror stories that affect you most because what scares you will likely scare others. Understanding what works in other films will help you refine your own.  
- Ideas are nothing until they’re written down. A monster in your head has no teeth—get it on the page so you can start making it better.  
- The first things that come to mind are often the most predictable. Push past them to uncover something fresh, surprising, and uniquely unsettling.  
- Characters don’t need to be likable, but they do need to feel real. Give them flaws, fears, and strong opinions—people root for those who stand out, not those who blend in.  
- What about this story is uniquely yours? Horror hits hardest when it comes from a personal place, so embed your own fears and experiences into it.  
- Horror only works if it feels believable—if you don’t believe in the fear you’re creating, the audience won’t either. Emotional truth makes scares linger long after the story ends.  
- Stakes should feel urgent and personal—world-ending threats may sound dramatic, but survival means more when it’s tied to something deeply human. Fear is strongest when it feels possible.  
- If a scare or scene isn’t working, don’t force it—set it aside. It may come back in a more visceral, impactful way later.  
- Know the difference between improving your story and over-polishing it. Horror thrives on raw instinct, not endless revision.  
- Coincidences should trap characters, never save them. If luck bails them out, the audience will feel cheated.  
- At its core, every single scary story is simple: a rule was broken, horror is closing in, and survival is the only way out — but surviving has stakes and consequences as real and hard as the stakes of not-surviving. If you can define that clearly, you can build anything from it.

The following is a rough outline including the title page, followed by structural markers and an overview of the first sequence’s intended purpose; the final section is the basics of the first scene:

Title: Blubber
By: Josh Bowman

Act 1 (Scenes 1-12)

Sequence 1: Setup (Scenes 1–6)

Purpose of Sequence 1

The goal is to introduce Maia’s structured life, her relationships with her family and Noah, and subtle hints of ecological imbalance. The Catalyst reveals the lurking threat of the Blenders, with the vortex/BURST mechanic subtly foreshadowed in a close-call moment to mirror and heighten later encounters.

Scene 1 (Opening Image – “This”)
	•	Purpose: Introduce Maia’s overly-structured life, highlighting her discipline, responsibilities, and relationships. Subtle hints of imbalance set the tone for rising tension.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	Maia wakes up early for swim practice, grabbing a protein bar and leaving the house while Derek zones out on the couch, watching the news.
	•	The radio in Derek’s car mentions unusually aggressive shark activity reported near Molokini Crater.
	•	James gives Maia an early-morning call as she heads into swim practice, reminding her about a family cultural obligation that afternoon.
	•	Hints of danger: Maia notices something off in the water during swim practice—a shadow below her in the ocean. She brushes it off, focusing on her strokes.

INT. MAIA’S BEDROOM – EARLY MORNING  

A phone alarm VIBRATES on the nightstand. Maia, 17, athletic, disciplined, cracks her eyes open. No hesitation—she silences the alarm and swings her legs out of bed.  

She moves with practiced efficiency: throws on swim gear, grabs a protein bar from her desk, and is out the door without a wasted step.  

INT. LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS  

DEREK, mid-40s, Maia’s uncle, slouches on the couch in yesterday’s clothes. The blue glow of the TV flickers over him as he absently watches the news.  

ON TV: A news anchor reports on unusual ocean activity. A scrolling ticker highlights *“SHARK INCIDENTS ON THE RISE NEAR MOLOKINI CRATER.”*  

Maia walks past, adjusting her swim bag.  

                         MAIA  
          You taking me or do I need to bike?  

Derek blinks, slow to register. He fishes car keys from his pocket and tosses them. Maia snatches them midair.  

                         DEREK  
          Don’t scratch her.  

Maia’s already out the door.  

EXT. DRIVEWAY – MOMENTS LATER  

Maia slides into Derek’s beat-up sedan. The radio kicks on mid-broadcast.  

                         RADIO HOST (V.O.)  
          —witnesses describe frenzied behavior,  
          not typical for the species. Marine  
          biologists say warmer waters may be  
          altering migration patterns—  

She turns the volume down, unimpressed.  

EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER – PRE-DAWN  

A quiet, local pool facility. Few cars in the lot. Maia pulls in, parks.  

INT. SWIM CENTER – LOCKER ROOM – MOMENTS LATER  

Fluorescent lights hum. Maia ties her hair up, methodical. A few other SWIMMERS murmur nearby, half-asleep. She’s already focused.  

INT. SWIM CENTER – POOL – MOMENTS LATER  

Maia slices through the water. Her strokes are clean, controlled. Lap after lap. She breathes in perfect rhythm.  

UNDERWATER – HER POV  

Muted silence. Bubbles trail her fingers.  

Then—a dark SHADOW shifts below. Slow. Deep.  

She hesitates, just for a second. Treads water, scanning the deep end. Nothing.  

A false moment of relief—then, SUDDEN MOVEMENT.  

Maia flinches, heart pounding—  

But it’s just a lane marker, drifting loose.  

She exhales, shakes it off, and dives back into her routine.  

INT. SWIM CENTER – LOCKER ROOM – LATER  

Damp hair, towel over her shoulders, Maia checks her phone. A missed call from JAMES. She dials back.  

                         MAIA  
          Hey, what’s up?  

                         JAMES (V.O.)  
          Just making sure you remember  
          today—Auntie’s thing?  

                         MAIA  
          Yeah, I know.  

                         JAMES (V.O.)  
          Be home on time.  

                         MAIA  
          Got it.  

She hangs up, stowing her phone. One last glance at the pool. That nagging feeling lingers.  

EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER – MORNING  

Sunrise. Maia heads to the car. Her routine continues, but something feels *off*.  

END SCENE.

Much better. Here’s the basics of scene 2 to write an initial scene draft from:
Scene 2 (Therefore)
	•	Purpose: Show Maia picking up the slack for her father, Derek, and introducing her daily grind. Subtle tension is layered in.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	After swim practice, Maia rushes home to find Derek still zoned out, missing an important call for their family business. She picks it up herself, covering for him, showing her maturity but also her frustration.
	•	Maia prepares for school and asks Derek to drop her off. On the ride, Derek barely speaks, still lost in his own head.
	•	As she walks into school, Maia spots Noah messing around with a basketball on campus and waves, but she’s too preoccupied to engage.

	•	Key Elements:
	•	At school, Maia is approached by James after her Hawaiian language class. He asks if she’ll be attending the cultural workshop this weekend. When she hesitates, James criticizes her priorities, implying she’s avoiding her heritage out of fear or laziness.
	•	The theme is planted when James says something like: “Being afraid of your weaknesses doesn’t make them go away. You either face them, or they swallow you whole.”
	•	After the interaction, Maia runs into Noah at lunch. He overhears her venting to a friend about James’ constant pressure and chimes in: “But if you do what you said you’d do, it might actually make him back off. Maybe it’s worth a shot?”
	•	Noah’s casual comment sticks with Maia, marking the first time he nudges her toward seeing her own potential.

The manager gives a small nod of approval before heading off.  

Across the store, NOAH and a few FRIENDS hover near the hot food section. He spots Maia behind the counter.  

                         NOAH  
          (calling over) See? Told you that was all you.  
          You just made it look easy.  

Maia rolls her eyes but fights a small smile.  

At the checkout, a CUSTOMER chats with the CASHIER, voice carrying.  

                         CUSTOMER  
          I swear, it’s the weirdest thing—first my cat disappears,  
          then my neighbor’s dog. Now all these fish acting  
          crazy by Kalepolepo.  

Maia listens without meaning to, her hands briefly pausing on the register.  

                         CASHIER  
          Sharks?  

                         CUSTOMER  
          Wouldn’t be this close in. It’s like the water’s just… wrong.  

Maia refocuses on her work, shaking off a flicker of unease.

Better. Here’s the next scene:

Scene 5 (But – Building Toward Catalyst)
	•	Purpose: Foreshadow the Blenders’ vortex/BURST mechanic in a tense, close-call scene.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	A fisherman casts off a pier near Kalepolepo Beach, using a fatty piece of meat as bait, joking with friends about “catching a whale.”
	•	The camera focuses on the water as a subtle whirlpool begins forming. The low hum of the Blender’s rotating jaws grows louder, but it’s faint and muffled, adding tension.
	•	The fisherman’s line tugs violently, and the pier shakes. A small Blender (under a foot long) is briefly visible beneath the surface as it BURSTS forward to snag the bait. The pier cracks, but the Blender retreats before fully revealing itself.
	•	Maia and a group of bystanders watch from a distance, unsettled but unsure of what they just saw.

EXT. KALEPOLEPO BEACH PARK – PIER – DAY  

A FISHERMAN leans against the railing, beer in one hand, fishing rod in the other. His BAIT—a thick chunk of meat—dangles just beneath the surface.  

                         FISHERMAN  
          Maybe I’ll catch a whale.  

His FRIENDS chuckle nearby.  

Beneath the water, something stirs. A faint, unnatural WHIRLPOOL starts to form, barely noticeable.  

The water HUMS—low, muffled, almost mechanical.  

The fisherman shifts his grip as his line pulls TIGHT.  

                         FISHERMAN  
          The hell—  

The rod JERKS, nearly yanking him forward. The pier GROANS as something immense strains against it.  

Beneath the surface, a DARK SHAPE lurks—a SMALL BLENDER, barely a foot long, its rotating maw a blur as it BURSTS upward, SNATCHING the bait in an instant.  

The pier SHUDDERS. WOOD SPLINTERS. The fisherman stumbles back, line snapping.  

Down the shore, Maia stands among a small crowd of BYSTANDERS, watching.  

The water stills. Nothing remains but a few lingering ripples.  

The fisherman exhales a shaky laugh, masking unease.  

                         FRIEND  
          What the hell was that?  

Nobody answers. Maia watches the water, unsettled but uncertain.

Don’t identify the Blender. These creatures are as of yet unknown to the reader. Use the opportunity to build suspense… (check your memory for what really matters in a horror/monster-in-the-house screenplay and use the techniques and ideas to make the moment a more effective scare, but make sure the fisherman only survives by happenstance and he has no idea… also, lose the FRIEND character. We don’t know him, we don’t need him.)

A FISHERMAN leans against the railing, beer in one hand, fishing rod in the other. His BAIT—a thick chunk of meat—dangles just beneath the surface.  

The water shifts. Barely a ripple.  

Then—a deep, muffled HUM.  

The fisherman frowns, adjusting his grip. His line TIGHTENS—slow at first, then like a HOOK in flesh.  

                         FISHERMAN  
          No, no, no—  

The rod YANKS. His feet SLIDE. He HITS the railing, beer flying.  

Beneath him, the water SWIRLS—too fast, too deliberate. Something MOVES inside it.  

The pier GROANS. WOOD SNAPS. A shadow LURCHES upward—fast, silent—  

The line SNAPS.  

The force sends the fisherman sprawling onto his back. He gasps, staring at the sky, waiting for the pier to break, for the thing in the water to—  

Nothing.  

The water is still. No ripples. No sound.  

Down the shore, Maia watches with a small crowd. No one speaks.  

The fisherman forces out a laugh, shaking his head as he pushes himself up.  

                         FISHERMAN  
          Hell no.  

He leaves his snapped rod where it fell and walks off, muttering.  

Maia lingers, eyes locked on the water. Her grip tightens on her bag.  

Something was there.

Replace “Hell no.” with something more impactful to the fisherman in an economic and humanitarian way. Something short that lets us feel something real for his loss — adding to the anxiety that he almost had a much worse outcome.

The following is the basics of my rough outline for scene 6, followed by a summary of the first sequence’s intended purpose (this ends the first sequence — The Setup):

Scene 6 (Catalyst – “But”)
	•	Purpose: The threat of the Blenders becomes undeniable. Maia has her first personal encounter with danger.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	After work, Maia takes a moment to sit on the beach and decompress, watching the sunset.
	•	As she wades into the water, she notices small whirlpools forming nearby. The low hum of the jaws grows louder, but it’s subtle.
	•	A larger shadow (slightly bigger Blender) moves closer to shore, creating ripples that make Maia uneasy. She backs out of the water just in time to avoid a sudden BURST as the Blender breaches the surface.
	•	Maia sees the shadow retreat into the ocean, and she knows something is very wrong. This marks the moment where the lurking danger becomes personal and inescapable.

Sequence 1 Summary
	•	Key Progressions:
	•	Maia’s disciplined, structured life is introduced, along with her strained relationships with Derek and James.
	•	Noah is established as a quiet but steady supporter of Maia, planting seeds of encouragement in Scenes 3 and 4.
	•	The Blenders’ vortex/BURST mechanic is foreshadowed in Scene 5 and becomes a terrifying reality in Scene 6.

EXT. BEACH – NIGHT  

The last light of the sun bleeds into the horizon. The waves lap gently.  

Maia sits alone in the sand, knees pulled to her chest. The day’s weight lingers on her face.  

She exhales, stands, and walks toward the shore. The tide wraps around her ankles, cool against her skin.  

A soft HUM drifts through the water. Barely there.  

She pauses. Looks around.  

A WHIRLPOOL twists just beyond the shallows. Then another. Small, but moving too deliberately to be the tide.  

Maia takes a slow step back.  

Beneath the surface, a SHADOW glides closer. Bigger than before.  

The hum LOWERS—like a deep, grinding inhale.  

The water BUCKLES.  

A MASSIVE SHAPE SURGES UPWARD—  

Maia STUMBLES back, hitting the wet sand as the water ERUPTS.  

A glimpse of something—dark, fast, wrong—before it VANISHES.  

The waves settle. The hum fades.  

Maia stares at the sea, breath ragged.  

Whatever that was—it was hunting.

Title: Blubber
By: Josh Bowman

Act 1 (Scenes 1-12)

Sequence 1: Setup (Scenes 1–6)

Purpose of Sequence 1
The goal is to introduce Maia’s structured life, her relationships with her father Derek and with Noah, and subtle hints of ecological imbalance. The Catalyst reveals the lurking threat of the Blenders, with the vortex/BURST mechanic subtly foreshadowed in a close-call moment to mirror and heighten later encounters.

Scene 1 (Opening Image – “This”)
Purpose: Introduce Maia’s overly-structured life, highlighting her discipline, responsibilities, and relationships. Subtle hints of imbalance set the tone for rising tension.
Key Elements:
- Maia wakes early for swim practice, grabbing a protein bar and leaving the house while Derek zones out on the couch, watching the news.
- James gives Maia an early-morning call as she heads into swim practice, reminding her about a family cultural obligation that afternoon.
- Hints of danger: During swim practice, Maia notices a shadow beneath her in the water. She brushes it off, focusing on her strokes.

Draft:
INT. HOUSE – DAY
The glow of a TV flickers. Derek sits on the couch, half-absorbed in the screen.
Maia moves with precision—protein bar, bag, shoes by the door.
She pauses, glances at Derek. He doesn’t look up.
EXT. STREET – DAY
Maia jogs to the car. Her phone BUZZES. She answers, clipped.
JAMES (V.O.)
Don’t forget this afternoon.
Maia ends the call. She drives.
INT. SWIM FACILITY – DAY
Blue water churns. Maia’s strokes cut clean through.
UNDERWATER – MAIA’S POV
A SHADOW shifts below. Gone as quickly as it appeared.
Maia breaks the surface, inhales, and forces focus back to her rhythm.

Scene 2 (Therefore)
Purpose: Show Maia picking up the slack for Derek and introduce her daily grind. Subtle tension layered in.
Key Elements:
- After swim practice, Maia returns home to find Derek missing an important call for their family business. She answers it, covering for him.
- Derek is active but numb, moving through his own distracted routines.
- Maia prepares for school and asks Derek to drop her off. He barely engages.
- At school, she sees Noah but is too preoccupied to engage.

Draft:
INT. HOUSE – DAY
Maia enters, hair damp, bag over her shoulder. The PHONE RINGS. Derek, in the kitchen, absentmindedly flips through mail, doesn’t move.
Maia grabs the phone.
MAIA
Aloha, this is Derek’s line.
She listens, jots a note, efficient.
Derek rummages in the fridge, finally bites into leftover food. He doesn’t notice her watching.
EXT. DRIVEWAY – DAY
Derek tosses trash into the bin, keys in hand. Maia hurries after him with her bag.
INT. CAR – DAY
They drive in silence. Derek taps the wheel. Maia stares out the window.
EXT. SCHOOL – DAY
Students scatter. Noah shoots a basketball casually near the steps. Maia waves. He smiles, but she keeps moving.

Scene 3 (Theme Stated – “But”)
Purpose: Introduce the theme of resilience through vulnerability. James pressures Maia, Noah provides quiet support.
Key Elements:
- James confronts Maia after Hawaiian language class about attending a cultural workshop.
- James criticizes her avoidance.
- James states the theme: “Being afraid of your weaknesses doesn’t make them go away. You either face them, or they swallow you whole.”
- Later at lunch, Noah overhears Maia venting and casually suggests that following through might help. His comment lingers.

Draft:
EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD – DAY
Students stream out of class. Maia exits, notebook hugged close.
James intercepts her, sharp.
JAMES
You coming this weekend?
Maia hesitates.
JAMES
Being afraid of your weaknesses doesn’t make them go away. You either face them, or they swallow you whole.
He leaves her standing.
EXT. SCHOOL LUNCH AREA – DAY
Maia sits with a friend, venting quietly. Noah drops onto the bench nearby, uninvited but easygoing.
NOAH
If you actually went, maybe he’d ease up. Worth a shot.
Maia studies him. He shrugs, then joins his friends. She’s left with the thought.

Scene 4 (Therefore)
Purpose: Show Maia succeeding at a small task, Noah reinforcing her confidence. Ecological tension rises.
Key Elements:
- Maia fixes a scheduling issue at her after-school job, impressing her manager.
- Noah spots her while grabbing food with friends, praises her casually.
- One of Noah’s friends mentions missing pets and strange fish near Kalepolepo Beach, unsettling Maia.

Draft:
INT. FOODLAND – DAY
Maia stands at the counter, phone in one hand, register open. She flips through schedules, solves a conflict with quick precision. Her manager nods approval.
Across the store, Noah enters with friends. He notices Maia.
NOAH
Told you—easy.
Maia looks up, almost smiling.
Noah’s friend, munching on a snack, leans in.
FRIEND
You hear about the pets disappearing? And those fish washing up at Kalepolepo? Creepy.
Noah laughs it off. Maia forces a shrug, but her eyes shift, uneasy.

Scene 5 (But – Building Toward Catalyst)
Purpose: Foreshadow the Blenders’ vortex/BURST mechanic in a tense, close-call.
Key Elements:
- A fisherman casts off a pier near Kalepolepo Beach.
- A subtle whirlpool forms, a faint hum grows.
- The fisherman’s line jerks violently, the pier shakes.
- Something surges, the fisherman loses his gear, but survives only by luck.
- Maia and bystanders see the disturbance but don’t understand.

Draft:
EXT. PIER – NIGHT
A fisherman leans on the rail, line cast deep. The water glimmers below.
The surface ripples unnaturally. A faint HUM rises.
His rod bends hard. He grips it, startled.
The planks CREAK as something tugs from beneath.
The water SWIRLS, darkening. A violent PULL yanks the rod from his hands.
The fisherman stumbles, slamming against the rail. He watches helplessly as his gear is dragged under.
FISHERMAN
That was my rent…
The water stills, quiet again.
On the beach, Maia stands with others, eyes fixed on the sea. No one speaks. The silence is heavier than answers.

Scene 6 (Catalyst – “But”)
Purpose: The threat becomes undeniable. Maia’s first personal encounter with danger.
Key Elements:
- After work, Maia sits on the beach, watching the sunset.
- She wades into the water, notices whirlpools forming. The low hum grows louder.
- A larger shadow moves closer to shore.
- The water erupts in a sudden BURST. Maia barely escapes.
- She sees the shadow retreat. She knows something is wrong.

Draft:
EXT. BEACH – NIGHT
The last light bleeds across the horizon. Maia sits in the sand, staring at the waves.
She rises, steps into the tide. Water folds around her ankles.
The HUM begins—low, distant.
She freezes. Ripples spiral into WHIRLPOOLS just beyond the shallows.
A SHADOW glides beneath the surface, larger than anything before.
The hum DEEPENS.
The sea ERUPTS. Maia stumbles back, splashing onto the wet sand. A shape breaches, gone before she can focus.
The ocean calms. The hum fades.
Maia stays frozen, chest heaving, eyes locked on the water.
She knows now—something is hunting.

Sequence 1 Summary
- Maia’s disciplined, structured life is introduced, along with strained relationships with Derek and James.
- Noah is established as a quiet but steady supporter, planting seeds of encouragement.
- The Blenders’ vortex/BURST mechanic is foreshadowed in Scene 5 and becomes a terrifying reality in Scene 6.
