I am developing an 'infinite-swimmer' game set in an undersea world for iOS, optimized for the iPhone 15 and compatible with earlier models. The game aims to balance casual controls with immersive gameplay, highlighting the beauty and challenges of the ocean. The design pillars are:

1. **Simple yet Engaging Controls:** The game will feature intuitive controls, crucial for casual gamers, yet engaging

 enough to keep players immersed. This balance is key to attracting a broad audience.

2. **High Immersion and Authenticity:** We aim to create a realistic oceanic atmosphere, showcasing the vastness and power of the sea. The game will also address environmental themes like pollution, instilling a sense of responsibility in players.

3. **Efficient Development:** Utilize generative AI art tools, such as Layer.ai plugin, and premade game templates like the 2D+3D Infinite Runner Engine, to expedite development without compromising quality. This approach will allow us to move at a breakneck pace while maintaining high standards.

4. **Marketability and Unique Selling Points (USPs):** Focus on Apple-specific technologies to give the game a competitive edge. Exploit features unique to the iPhone 15 and Apple Vision Pro devices that competitors haven't leveraged effectively. This will include enhanced graphics, augmented reality capabilities, and more immersive experiences enabled by Apple’s neural processors.

5. **Player Experience and Engagement:** Create a game world that players want to return

 to, even for short periods. The procedural generation of underwater environments will make each playthrough unique and captivating, leveraging the powerful neural processors in Apple devices.

6. **Stand Out from Competitors:** Identify and implement features underutilized by competitors on the iOS platform. This includes advanced haptic feedback, AR capabilities, and superior graphics optimizations for the latest iPhone models.

7. **Organizational Efficiency:** Maintain a clear and accessible reference system for the development team. This will ensure quick access to needed resources and information, crucial for meeting development timelines and ensuring a fair player experience.

8. **Responsibility and Environmental Awareness:** Integrate themes of ocean preservation and human impact into gameplay. This not only adds depth to the game but also aligns with current environmental concerns, making the game relevant and meaningful.

By focusing on these aspects, we aim to develop an undersea 'infinite-swimmer' game that is casual yet immersive, utilizing Apple's latest technologies to provide a unique experience that stands out in the market. The emphasis will be on efficient development, marketability, and delivering an exceptional player experience that highlights the game's core pillars.

Can you help me create an workflow I can maintain at a much-faster than normal development cycle by identifying detailed low-level tools and features to accomplish this using the Unity engine platform for creation, implementing testing, and releasing the game while cross-checking those low-level Unity-specific entities against detailed low-level info about what I can accomplish with the game running on the aforementioned Apple devices and using their industry-leading neural-processing and graphics technologies to keep an edge over competitors?

Since your focus as stated seems to be "creative aspects" and "concepts like character design, world building, lore creation, level and map design," let's start there and I'll treat you as the expert:

I am developing an 'infinite-swimmer' game and need to design the main character, a female scuba-diver. The character should have a simple art style, appealing and family-friendly in appearance, suitable for a broad audience including younger players. 

Key requirements include:

* Low Poly-Count: The design must be performant, with an optimized poly-count for efficient rendering.
* Natural Swimming Animations: Include fluid animations for swimming and quick movements to shift between lanes. These lanes keep the character in view and vary in speed, representing ocean currents.
* Forward Motion and Speed Variations: The character should exhibit perpetual forward motion, with speed variations beyond player control, to enhance game immersion.

Given these specifics and the overarching goal of simple controls with immersive gameplay, how would you approach the concept and design of this character? What steps should we take? Feel free to ask for any additional details necessary to align the character design with the game's vision.
