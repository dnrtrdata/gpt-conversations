refiner hello

refiners if you're here it's because you

made the choice or perhaps the choice

has been made for you to delve deeper

into the latest episode of severance

season 2 episode 4 wo's Hollow so let's

just get straight into it now I don't

know about you but I thought this

episode

was intense from the very beginning the

tone just felt very eerie and

unsettling to me it felt like a horror

game or like an escape room story

Quest but also a bit like a Bible Fable

thing and of course we end up being told

this is supposed to be a team building

Retreat and they're being told you're in

this world which has this meaning and it

all sounds like it could be true but

that's why it feels like just one of

these kind of corporate team building

exercises that's like an escape room

where they're trying to make you feel

immersed into this pretend world but

obviously for our any

characters they don't know that all of

this is

obviously made up for this little team

building experience

so that's why Everything feels so eerie

and unsettling because we're seeing it

through their perspective of just

suddenly waking up in the middle of

nowhere in the cold in the snow Irving

waking up on this massive frozen lake

which we will get into the symbolism of

later on but that's why I think for us

as viewers during almost I would say the

whole of this episode it kind of feels

really disconnected to the tone that

we're used to seeing in this show so

it's like the whole time we're trying to

kind of find our footing of figuring

out where are we is this real what does

it mean so I think this episode was

created for us to experience this

journey as if we are one of the enies

we're just suddenly waking up in this

known area all these weird things are

happening and we're just trying to

figure it out the same as how the enies

are and that's why everything about the

landscape and the way the characters are

acting throughout it it all feels very

disorientating and like I said it's

because we're seeing all of this from

the in's perspective we've just suddenly

woken up this is our next moment of

Consciousness we're Somehow Here yeah

okay and with the fact that I think

we're seeing all of this from the in's

perspective I think that's

why when we see this shot of The Cliff

face side bit and there's no TV thing

there and then suddenly just a few

seconds

later they turn around and there's now a

TV up on there I think that's because as

the in's they initially didn't notice

that there was a TV either so it's only

just appearing to them as if by Magic

because they've only just noticed it

like I think the TV was always there and

we're just being shown and presented

information in this episode as if we are

experiencing it as the enies are now as

we see from the little clip shown on the

TV this is apparently their first ever

outdoor Retreat and team building a

current but I think I mean obviously

it's it's not just a retreat right but I

think this is the company's way

of

manufacturing fear and like Scare

Tactics and paranoia to the enies

to make them feel afraid of the outside

world like they're saying we know that

you're so curious about the outside

world since you did the OTC thing so

we're giving you a taste of the Outdoor

World so you don't try to do an OTC

thing

again but obviously what they're really

doing is they're trying to make

the in's afraid of the outside

world by making this whole experience

really creepy unsettling unnerving full

of like paranoia like as they're going

throughout the whole thing until they

meet Mr miluk they've got no idea what's

going on and that's why the tone of this

episode is also super weird cuz like I

said we're experiencing this like the

enies are and this is basically just

Lumen deciding to create psychological

submission through

fear so it's like all the elements we

see of like the horror story stuff like

the dead creature they come up upon the

campfire storytelling of like a weird

creepy horror

story it's also that the enies end up

feeling afraid of the outside world so

that they end up willingly choosing to

stay in their confined safe space on the

severed floor where they've said things

like death can't you know they don't

exist here things like that can't affect

you here so now that we've laid the

groundwork for what the tone of this

episode is really doing let's explore

that creepy Campfire story now as Hela

or as we'll get to Helena ends up

concluding about the story he turned

into the forest because he

masturbated um I would just like to say

where is Lumen HR Miss W is here she is

a literal

child and she should not be around

adults discussing such intimate

things this is

inappropriate and this is why you should

not hire a

child for an adult job but now let's

talk about the actual story that is

being told about his supposed brother

daa and what I think it means so like I

said at the beginning the whole tone and

Vibe of this episode felt a bit like a

Bible Fable or something and you know

like we have the four MDR team kind of

having to venture into the unknown to

follow unclear guidance but they just

have some sort of faith

that if they follow what they're told to

do it will lead to something so

already it all feels a bit like a Bible

Fable but then as we start reading

through K's apparent fourth appendage I

believe

that the story is about K

himself more specifically about his ouy

self and his in self I think this is a

story about the creation of the whole

concept of severance and how

K came up with the idea the creation of

having this separated part of himself so

yeah like I said I think this is a story

about K as him as his ouy self and daa

is representing his in self so the

brother isn't real just to clarify that

and with the same kind of Bible

religious tones I think this story is a

parable that functions as an allegory so

the parable aspect to it is the story

presents a seemingly simple narrative

about two twin brothers one of whom is

shamed and possibly killed for his

sexual inclinations should we say and

like many Parables it conveys a moral or

philosophical kind of lesson and this

one seems to be about guilt repression

self-discipline punishment type stuff

and parabel often leave room for

interpretation and suggest a deeper

truth through the

storytelling but I also think it has

this allegorical aspect to it because

the twin brother is not just a l

character but it represents something

deeper which like I said is most likely

an aspect of the protagonist himself of

K himself his in his hidden desires

which he feels Shame about the killing

of the twin could symbolize self-

repression punishment of the Shadow Self

of himself that he feels Shame about

that he doesn't like and like I said I

think this was the creation of severance

the concept of how the in self was made

so in this way the entire story becomes

a metaphor for kier's own internal

struggle and I think for us as the

audience it's presented as a parable

because it teaches a lesson in a way

about guilt control and the

consequences of giving in to these

desires that for some reason we should

feel shame about and we shouldn't

indulge

in but as I said it's also an allegory

of K psychological spiritual kind of

moral conflict because each element

represents something deeper

than what the stories on a surface level

seems to be saying and like I said it

seems to actually be about like the

concepts of identity

morality repression so to summarize my

thoughts on this K's supposed twin

brother DEA is a symbolic standing for

the in part of K that he believed were

shameful uncontrollable

sinful

and that he believed deserved to be

locked away and punished forever which

is exactly what's happening with the

idea of severance it's condemning a part

of yourself

to lifelong

punishment it's like self-inflicting

hatred and it's almost as if the outies

because they have no memory of what

their in life goes through maybe they

don't think or care that they're really

torturing a part of themselves

but it's obviously really sad for the

innie because the innie has no

recollection of their own life so they

don't even know essentially why they're

being punished like in episode 9 of

season 1 when the OTC happens and inie

Mark is talking to Devon he says I just

want to know why like why did he put me

in there because for them it literally

is like why am I being punished like

this

so the concept to me doesn't obviously

make um moral logical sense in the way K

is presenting it because it's about

punishing a part of yourself

forever but you never really get to

experience the punishment as your ouy

self and those parts of yourself that

you're

punishing still exist within you so

you're not

really like helping yourself or healing

in yourself or getting this weird

spiritual enlightenment that K and the

whole Severance thing is trying to make

us believe in their whole kind of

religious cult thing sense you get me I

hope I'm making sense I'll probably have

to delve deeper into this another time

but essentially what I'm saying is that

this whole story about daa is actually

like the origin story for K taming the

four tempers

K says in I think it's season 1 episode

3 when they go to the perpetuity Wing he

says I walked into the cave of my own

mind and there I tamed the four tempers

woe dread Frolic and Malice so applying

that to the story of this supposed twin

brother he's obviously identifying these

parts of himself that he feels shame for

or something like that you know parts of

himself he doesn't like or think are

acceptable and deserve to be punished

now I obviously don't I don't fully know

the timeline of when the severan chip

was first

created but I think this is at least the

origin of the concept of having a

separate self based on The Taming of

these tempers these

emotions and the goal is to

punish this part of yourself it's also

like with the religious undertones and

everything it's as if you're you're like

sentencing a part of yourself to

damnation like we have to think about

the politician's wife in season one

Gabby Gabby I think yeah who any

apparently supposedly only seems to

exist to give birth so her ay self never

has to deal

with these almost like repressed

punishable parts of existence and she I

guess thinks that's fine but it's weird

isn't it because like I think she's

treating it like it's a different person

so that she can just enjoy her life

whilst her innie has to suffer but it's

weird because it does happen to her you

are the same person so yeah basically

it's weird it's weird because obviously

as I'm going through this K's religious

philosophy stuff doesn't seem to make

logical sense but that's a whole another

thing to get into another time the point

here is obviously we're witnessing the

we're being told the origin

of severence essentially and how it does

come from a place of parts of yourself

being deserving of punishment but anyway

as mili finishes telling the cre story

around the

campfire we then get to heli Helena

laughing and I think this is a genuine

moment of Helena being her true self and

like slipping up and laughing because

obviously she's an Egan she probably

grew up with these stories I think this

story about daa it gives me the sense

that these were the kind of stories that

followers of care in the religious sense

in the cult sense like M coobel would

tell their children so like Ms coobel

went to that Um Myrtle Eagan School for

Girls orphanage place which side note I

think that's where Miss Hong is also

from and they were probably told these

kind of

stories growing up and this is why it's

like it should be taken in this

religious kind of Bible sense but

because they're kind of essentially

telling a group of enies who are like

children adolescent still have hormones

Etc they're telling them you cannot

succumb to your sexual desires because

those are things you should feel shame

for

instead and I think

Helena probably heard this

story as it is told here growing up up

and it's basically that thing of being

told it's like that scene from Mean

Girls where it's like do not have sex

because like you will get chlamydia and

die but anyway everyone takes them

condoms like it's a bit like that it's

kind of like you're trying to instill

these things that these kids should feel

shame about into them and obviously

Helena is still a real person and I

think she's just being genuine she's

letting out her laughter because this is

probably the only time she's been able

to be like wow this is all a load of



like like you know we see on this screen

here I mean seriously that's the dumbest

thing I've ever heard like I'm I'm sure

a lot of kids teenagers probably feel

the same way when they're being

told uh not to have sex and everything

and since we're talking about Helena

here I just want to say that I think

Helena planned this whole little team

building occurrence whatever trip on her

own accord I don't think that the

company the board had anything to do

with this I think this was all Helena

because she has a lot of authority over

the severed floor she would have been

the one to say to milic hey let's do

this whole thing and you just have to go

with it because I have more Authority in

this company than you because we've

already heard that the board's real

priority is Marquez completing Cold

Harbor they don't care about team

bonding or in getting to experience

nature or the Outdoor World they only

brought back his team in MDR so that he

could complete Cold Harbor so why are we

wasting

time doing this little trip for no

reason because the plan doesn't work

it's it did the opposite of team

building the team fell apart and Irving

ended up probably dead at the end of

this so she can't even pretend like this

helps towards Mark completing Cold

Harbor so then why why did she do it

like why would she plan for the whole

team to have this little trip I think

it's pretty obvious

I think she did all of this just so she

could sleep with Mark which by the way

is crazy because she's supposed to be an

Egan and they seem to see enies as

lesser

beings that don't deserve human rights

yet she is sleeping with one of them

like I'm sure if her family if the Egan

found out she slept with an inie I think

she would be cast out from the family

like we heard in the perpetuity Wing

there was like a black sheep of the

family I can't remember the name of the

person but I imagine that's what it

would be like like this is quite a big

betrayal to The Egan philosophy of how

they see and treat enies I bet they

would find this obviously disgusting

like like we saw her father's reaction

in episode 9 season 1 where he's

speaking to who he thinks is his

daughter Hela but it's actually heli and

he says like I cried in my bed when they

told me what she tried to do to you what

that innie

did and it's

like what are you going to think if you

found out your actual daughter not even

her in self but Helena slept with an

innie so now we have to wonder

why why why does Helena Egan want to

orchestrate this whole little trip like

I said I think behind the board back

just to sleep with Marquez could it be

that she's just doing it because she can

it's just a

self-indulgent pleasure seeking thing

and there's nothing more to it maybe

maybe it's also connected to some power

Dynamic right she just knows that she

can get away with this and do it so

she's going to that's a very rich Elite

person attitude I think just in society

in general so maybe that's it but also

what if she's doing it for more than

just the Intercourse itself like Beyond

just the physical act in the moment what

if she wants to have Mark's baby now you

might be thinking whoa what are you

about to talk about what do you mean

baby well let me remind you of the intro

sequence so here as we can see in the

intro

sequence ay Mark as we know because he's

wearing red wakes up surrounded

by little babies wearing

suits now when I first was watching the

intro I thought this probably is just

like a visual representation of the in

cells like how they obviously say the

Ines are like

children so here we're just seeing a

collection of

in represented as children as babies

wearing

suits however we also see the shot of a

baby kit

Egan and it's snow

like this is now making me think what if

Helena

purposely wanted to sleep with Marc s to

have a baby which would be a baby Egan

which is what we are seeing in this

opening scene and with the snow like

they're outside camping having this

Retreat during the snow during winter

time during the

snow um so if she ends up being pregnant

the creation of this baby happened

during winter in the snow so this is a

baby care in the snow whatever her

reasons are for doing this the point

is I definitely think this whole trip

was planned by Helena to sleep with Mark

for whatever reason and that the board

doesn't know about this so let me just

explain why I don't think the board had

any anything to do with arranging this

little team building

experience and why I don't think they

would ever agree to it either now we

know for a fact that Lumen does not

allow enies to sleep at work we've seen

this in season one because they seem to

be very hypervigilant about making sure

that the enies Do Not doze off because

we see this with Irving falling asleep

and milch appearing almost instantly to

take him off to Wellness and the reason

why Luma and the

board they don't want in sleeping is

because I think they're aware of the

memory memory bleed in the subconscious

mind that happens during sleep so they

know that's almost like a way to bypass

the code detectors it is almost a way to

send information in and out of lumen is

through the person's subconscious dream

state and that is why they're so

hypervigilant about making sure enies

don't fall asleep at work so then why

would they allow this group of enies to

experience sleep for the first time ever

and for a whole night that doesn't make

any sense they would know that this was

dangerous and risky because of memory

bleed so who would be foolish enough to

not care

about potential

consequences other than Helena doing it

for her own personal selfish reasons we

have to assume as well because she's an

Egan and she's quite far up in the

company she also must be aware of memory

bleed occurring during sleep so she was

just

like oh let's just risk it so I can get

laid

anyway it it's so you know what it's

giving it's giving feted Muppet that's

what it's giving I I think I might be on

her father's side now I think maybe she

is a feted moppet this is foolish if she

did do everything I'm saying like she

planned this whole trip just to sleep

with Mark she allowed the memory bleed

stuff to happen because of them having

well experiencing sleep for the first

time

ever then yeah she is a fool she is a

feted mopet now as we're speaking about

the memory bleed stuff obviously we saw

again in season 1 that it was Irving

experiencing memory bleed through sleep

because we saw the black dripping goo

that turned out to be paint his AE

trying to subconsciously send this

message of the dark

hallway to his in self and that's where

we get this

creepy super creepy fitting into the

whole tone of this episode epod dream

sequence that Irving has and obviously

everything we see in the

dream exists because that's the only the

these elements are the only visual

things his in self has access to to like

draw aart to create the dream because

like you know that's what dreams are

it's like your subconscious taking

elements from your real life or things

that you've seen on TV movies it's like

visual elements and it's created

a story with those visual elements and

that's what we're seeing here like he's

in the dead Frozen Woods because that

really is where he is and what is he

dreaming of himself at work wearing his

work clothes which he sees himself in

his desk

Etc so as we know from Irving's ATI he

seems to have a lot of top secret Intel

on Lumen he had a whole list of all the

severed employees and where they live

their contact information

we know that the in

were in the outside world

for I think it was 39 minutes is what

mili says in episode

one and we obviously did not see the

full 39 minutes of what innie Irving got

up to so I imagine he probably read a

lot of his outies material on lumen

and that's why the Irving we see in this

episode is so suspicious and paranoid

and

distrusting of this whole team building

outing like and why he's so quick to

confront who he thinks is heli like

pressing her about the Night Garden of

stuff is because

he he knows now that Lumen is suspicious

and this part of his Outi personality

this kind of maybe military background

MI5 type surveillance

Intel is now coming to the Forefront of

his in self because it's still there

within him but he didn't have the

context to put things together so I

wonder if in the documents he saw that

his out he had it mentioned Helena Egan

or like just the Egan family and had

them listed right so then what we're

seeing in this dream sequence are parts

of his ati's knowledge seeping through

to him in ways in which his in would

understand in like the visual medium for

his in to process it so obviously we see

him sat at the computer and he looks

through the Gap to where this would be

hel's seat in MDR but instead of

heli It's the weird half of a womanized

person representing wo

apparently interesting that the woe

woman also I think seems to have red

hair like heli so she sat in hel's seat

so clearly wo is

hel and then with the numbers the

numbers 4 57 they actually match the

corresponding letters in the alphabet so

I I'll explain right so 1 equal

a four we'll get to five is e 7 is G and

then 1 and four together are

14 which is n so then as we see the

screen the numbers start moving they end

up turning into to the letters that the

numbers correspond to in the alphabet

which are obviously the letters a e g

and n and obviously that spells Egan and

we get this creepy little shot of it

kind of looking like hel's face

so super weird and creepy and then we

obviously get the awful jump scare that

wakes him up so that he can

now well we'll see what he does with

this new information now I was one of

the people that did always suspect that

this was Helena pretending to be heli

but I wasn't sure how the Revelation was

going to happen I thought it would

probably happen from Mark or the MDR

team as a collective figuring it

out but to see how it's actually playing

out and how intense this scene ends up

being was just so far beyond my

predictions

expectations and just to Quick say I

love this line where Irving says to

Helena so if you're not her then who are

you because that's the key

Central I would say I don't know tagline

of this show we're constantly being

asked who who are you and like I said

this scene is obviously just so much

more intense than I ever imagined

especially given the tone and pacing of

this episode up until this point like

him

threatening Helena's life I did not

expect and then of course the whole Jig

Is up godamn it Seth do it and the look

on Mark's face here when Helena screams

godamn it Seth do

it this is the face of Mark being

like

um so it's real like everything that

Irving is saying right now is real do it

Seth now this obviously reveals that

milch knew the whole time that Helena

was playing this little pretending to be

heli game and like I said that's obvious

because she has direct authority over

him so anything she wants to do he has

to follow and notice how he didn't

remove this Glasgow block until she

directly told him to do

it so even when her life is being

threatened he is still only making

decisions that she is

authorizing and that's how she obviously

would have been able to orchestrate this

this whole little

outing without the board knowing because

mili just has to listen to her and

follow what she

says and why would the board know who's

going to tell the board that this is

happening Helena has the most Authority

out of everyone on the severed floor the

only people above her are people who

work directly with the board or just the

board

itself so how are they going to know

that this is happening she's obviously

the gatekeeper of secrecy of what's

happening on the severed floor with

stuff like this and then this scene oh

look at her face this is the first time

I suspect heli is waking up since being

tackled off the stage during the OTC

stuff I can't even

imagine waking up with your face

underwater it must be obviously terrify

fying and also freezing cold this is

winter that water will be ice cold now

this scene um of Irving saying I'm sorry

I'm so sorry hel this is making us aware

of how complicated this Severance

procedure is by having two different

versions of yourself two different

consciousnesses it's like Irving was

obviously fine threatening the life of

Helena Egan because as he said she's a

mole she's been down here pretending to

be heli the whole

time and then obviously as soon as hel's

brought

back he's so sorry for drowning her and

doing what he had to do to get her back

but it's I think it's two

consciousnesses in one body and it just

makes things so

complicated like morally ethically and

the toying of emotions you must feel

from going from like drowning one

version of someone to being so

apologetic at what you just had to do to

their physical body to bring them back

it's so interesting and complex now of

course as we see the consequence for

Irving's

actions are that milch is sentencing him

to death so I guess we'll have to see if

we see more of inie Irving I know with

him saying

to

Dylan just remember hang in there maybe

it could be a secret message to remind

Dylan

of it's possible to bring his inie back

almost whenever because of the OTC stuff

which is obviously where the hanging

there came from it was on the poster in

the break room showing Dylan holding

both of the switches open for the OTC so

maybe this is Irving saying I'm not

really dying because I can be brought

back remember so yeah it would just be

interesting to see what happens with

Irving's in character going forward are

we going to see any more of

him or is that it I I personally hope

it's not it but I obviously I mean as

this show has demonstrated with each

episode it's so unpredictable you never

know what you're going to get you don't

know where the story Line's

going it's full of

surprises so this is for me one of

those story threads where we're just

going to have to wait and see where it

takes us where it leads but now I just

want to touch on inie Mark inie Mark has

found himself not just in a love

triangle he is in a love maybe hexagon

now in

Mark was under the assumption that he

slept with

heli and now he's going to have to come

to terms with the fact he actually slept

with her

Outi Helena but on top of that ouy Mark

has started the process of reintegration

which I believe is a process that

happens over a long period of time of

the two consciousnesses bleeding over as

we saw in the scene where hel and Mark

were sleeping

together and her face turns into M Casey

to him but Gemma to ouy

Mark I believe that's the first time

inim Mark is experiencing the slow

effect of reintegration of the two

consciousnesses merging so he's he is

having almost like memory bleed of his

ay seeing him sleeping with someone who

would obviously be his wife Gemma so not

only is inie Mark going to have to face

the fact he slept with hel's oue but oue

Mark is going to have to come to terms

with the fact that his in

self just point blank slept with someone

else and remember the whole point of

Mark reintegrating is because he wants

to see his wife again he's driven by his

love for his wife Gemma so there are

essentially six people involved in this

not a love triangle because obviously we

have innie ay Mark heli Helena in

ouy and Miss

Casey and hopefully also Gemma if the

ouy version of Miss Casey Gemma still

exists so this is

messy now this weird love hexagon thing

got me thinking this whole episode was

full

of I guess you could say sexual desire

right we have the story of daa being

about touching himself and then sexual

shame we obviously have Mark and Helena

actually sleeping together and it made

me think this whole season so far

actually has introduced a lot of these

kind of emotional

sexual

moral kind of

conflicts because obviously those kind

of feelings are what has driven ay Mark

to be reintegrated so he can get his

wife back which is obviously like an

emotional sexual connection thing we

also saw Natalie with ricken which had

like undercurrents of flirting

Vibes and we also saw Gretchen Dylan's

ati's wife maybe we saw I guess laying

the groundwork

for her potentially developing

feelings for inie Dylan so so it got me

thinking exploring the emotional sexual

love kind

of moral

conflicts seems to be a big part of this

season's themes so as I was thinking

about it if lust seems to be a Core

theme of season 2 it made me think I

think this season is

also exploring the second circle of hell

which is lust now what I'm referring to

here is about Dante's Inferno which is

the Journey Through The Nine Circles of

hell now the nine circles of hell are

all about the different types of

punishments that

Sinners are condemned to after death

because of the consequences of the

decisions they made in their mortal life

and The Nine Circles as you can see on

the screen they descend down where as

you go further down the worse the sin is

that you are being punished for so as I

said I believe that this second season

we are currently exploring the second

Circle which is lust so I'm first going

to

explain the connections that I've made

between season 2 so far far and the

second circle of lust and then I'll

touch on how the first season also

corresponds to the first Circle which is

limbo and then we're going to jump

to where the story of severance might be

ending up which is the ninth circle of

hell which is all about

treachery and it's where Satan himself

is trapped in

ice

so let me explain how we are currently

in the second Circle first okay so what

is the second circle of hell of lust

lust is the endless storm lust is the

endless storm of Desire it's where

Souls that are trapped here are

endlessly being blown about spiraling in

The Winds of a violent storm unable to

ever rest or escape and this NeverEnding

storm and winds are supposed to

represent

how they Liv their mortal life from a

place of lust like these Souls were

being driven by emotion and impulse

rather than control and reason and that

is why they are sentenced to having to

be in this endless storm forever now

lust isn't just about having sexual sin

it's about what happens when someone

lets their emotions and desires take

control these souls are people who acted

on pure

passion

and I think that obviously mirrors what

we have seen so far in this season

particularly with

Helena using this team building Retreat

as a way to sleep with

Mark that is purely a lust driven

decision that she has

made and the imagery of them being stuck

in these stormy winds as we saw in this

episode The enies are outside in the

wind in the cold we see the wind blowing

they're close

and we also see the wind blowing the

clothes of those creepy maybe I think

these were like animatronic or hologram

type beings but we see the wind you know

this is a show set in winter so

obviously there is stormy winds right

and we also briefly had another mention

of wind in episode one of this season

where where gwendaline why asks Mark

what's the wind like is it just like

someone blowing on your face she could

have asked about any type of weather

condition but she specifically asked

about wind and as I already mentioned

the whole thing about the second circle

of hell is about the souls being forever

blown about in a chaotic uncontrollable

wind that cannot escape from and that

also seems to be

mirroring the type of energy are enies

are giving this season they have all

been acting apart from Dylan I guess

because he has been bribed with family

visitation but they are acting in

chaotic uncontrollable

ways so if in season 2 We are following

the second circle of

hell I also think in season one we

followed the first circle of hell which

is

limbo which is the place where Souls of

pagans and the unbaptized wonderand the

caves of limbo in loneliness with the

desperation to meet God right it is a

place of Eternal waiting it's where

souls are trapped in a static unchanging

existence aware that something greater

exists but they are unable to reach it

that is the definition of what the

severed floor and existing as an any on

the severed floor is they are aware that

there is an outer self an outer world

but they can never get there instead

they have to live in this constant

sterile

environment and it's said that the

people who were sent here were morally

good but they were just unbaptized so

because of that they don't get

physically

tortured they just get to experience

Eternal sadness and longing for

more because like I said they're aware

that in this case Heaven exists but they

will never be able to experience it to

reach there to

escape and of course this massively

reflects the lives of our enies on the

seventh floor because they're not being

being directly physically tortured but

they're obviously stuck in this kind of

psychological punishment right it's it's

a state of psychological suffering

through

stagnation basically so then as I began

making these connections between season

1 being the first circle of hell season

2 being the second I then started

looking into

the whole thing of Dante's Inferno to

like refresh my memory about the story

and the beginning of Dante's descent

into

hell begins with him being lost in a

dark wood which is literally the story

that are enies are going on in this

episode like they read I

ascended and we ventured into the wood

right so it's about K and his supposed

TN venturing off into the woods where

the story then unfolds which is exactly

what happens with Dante and of course

this whole team building thing is

supposed to be about the Ines following

the footsteps of what happened with K

and his supposed twin brother and notice

how daa it's a bit like Dante in a way

with a d you know so it's almost exactly

like our enies are also following the

story of Dante beginning the exploration

into the different circles of hell it's

like we're being taken back to the

beginning of this journey through hell

with them like obviously we see the

enies are just dropped off in the middle

of nowhere in some snowy woods they

don't know where they are they don't

know what's waiting for them they don't

know what this is about and they're

being forced to confront something that

is unknown and scary they're then made

to listen to the these disturbing

stories about kier's supposed twin that

are meant

to shape their mind and their point of

view in a certain way and it's just like

Dante is warned about Sin the enies are

being warned about Sin as well and like

I mentioned the beginning of Dante's

Journey beginning in a dark Forest he

says mid way through the Journey of our

life I found myself in a dark forest for

the straight path was lost and even the

way that Dante's Inferno is written just

sounds so reminiscent of

how this daa care story is being

presented and the whole you know

following the footsteps through the

woods they're not just following K and

his brother the K and the brother thing

is literally Dante's Journey as well so

I'm making these connections right I'm

like thinking we're definitely following

Dante's Journey Through Hell now

obviously I don't think the show is

going on for nine Seasons so I thought

okay let me just skip straight to the

Ninth Circle to see where this show

might be heading like what is the

direction conclusion of this

story and this might blow your mind

because it has blown my mind okay okay

so the Ninth Circle is for treachery and

this is where Satan is imprisoned in ice

from the waist down and is for people

who commit treachery which is seen as

the

absolute worst form of

sin and notice how this is the

center the final level of hell and it's

not a punishment fire but ice The Ninth

Circle is literally a frozen

Wasteland where

souls are completely trapped beneath the

ice unable to

move and the deeper the Betrayal the

deeper The Sinner is buried in the ice

so hell's final punishment the worst

punishment of all is eternal

Frozen isolation so I'm just going to

quickly show you a little image just to

show where we're going to be going to

with all of this ice stuff so here at

the top we obviously have Earth you know

this is the first Circle 2 third fourth

fifth 6th 7th eighth now this is where

things get a bit complicated so the

eighth and the Ninth Circle have further

layers to them so this is the eighth one

here and it goes all the way down to

these uh Frozen Giants which we're not

going to get into here you can find out

you know research yourself about what's

going on here but this is where we are

now in the Ninth Circle bit and this

Ninth Circle is also divided into four

sub circles that we can see here you

know 1 2 3 4 and this little icy monster

is the devil basically right at the

heart of everything now this Frozen

landscape this Frozen circle of hell is

actually depicted as a frozen lake the

worst Sinners are punished by being

trapped in a frozen lake now this frozen

lake has a name which is kitus which is

named after the River kitus from Greek

mythology which was known as the river

of wailing in the Underworld okay and as

we can see in the image I have on screen

Satan himself is depicted as being

imprisoned at the center of

coitus eternally Frozen representing the

deepest pit of Hell and this version of

Satan of the devil is trapped from the

waist down in the frozen lake of

coitus right I hope you're sticking with

me here because this is getting crazy

now the reason it's all depicted as a

frozen lake is because this final worst

sin treachery is seen as the coldest and

most calculated sin so therefore the

punishment should match the sin now as I

mentioned this final level of hell is

first divided into four further

Rings each going down each representing

the different level of punishment for

the type of treachery sin someone

committed so the more severe the sin the

deeper they are buried in the ice okay

now I definitely won't be able to

pronounce the four inner Rings

correctly so I'm just going to touch on

briefly what each one represents and who

gets sent there so in the first one it's

for people who betrayed their family so

it's based on it's named after Cain from

the Bible who murdered his brother Abel

and as I said it represents people who

betray their own family members whether

it's killing or just betraying them in

some other sense for personal gain and

the punishment on this level is that

they are frozen up to their necks in ice

with their heads free to move so they

can still move their heads and see

around them but they are obviously still

trapped and buried within the ice now

what does this remind us of in Severance

the recently put up

painting of K paron his betrayers they

talk about the employees of lumen as a

family so this image

directly visually sounds exactly like

this first Inner Circle of the ninth

circle of

hell where the betrayers of their family

are being punished by being buried up up

to their necks so they can they still

can move their heads around and their

betrayal isn't the worst level of

betrayal which is why they're getting

this lesser form of

punishment okay so then the second

layer

is for people who are betrayers of

country so it's named after antenna a

Trojan who betrayed his City to the

Greeks so the people who are here are

politicians soldiers and just those who

betrayed their country City or people

now a little side note the next episode

is titled Trojan Horse which is

obviously related to the name of this

layer so even more connection

symbolism now the people who are

condemned to this layer they're also

buried up to their necks in the ice but

this time they are unable to move their

heads and can only move their mouths now

the third

layer is named after an Egyptian ruler

pomy who invited his guests to a feast

and then murdered them so this layer is

for betrayers of guests it's people who

betrayed those that trusted them the

most like guests allies those under

their protection now this layer is a bit

more complicated with the punishment so

as soon as they do the act of betrayal

against guests or however it is their

souls immediately fall into

hell while demons take over their living

bodies on Earth so I wonder how this

will conect connect with the show I know

there's a lot of theories about

reanimating the Egan family that might

be currently frozen in

ice so this if that is true this might

be what we see is the original Souls of

these people are trapped in a version of

Hell whilst demons The Egan family take

over their living bodies on

Earth but what happens to them in hell

is that these people these souls are

completely frozen in ice unable to move

or speak and then we get to the

final deepest layer which are for the

absolute worst Sinners of all and this

is for betrayers of Lords or

benefactors and it's named after Judas

who betrayed Jesus so this might be

people who betrayed their kings their

super iors the people who they were

supposed to just abide to and these

people again are completely incarcerated

in ice and it's depicted in quite a not

great visual way but it talks about

their bodies being in unfavorable

physical positions in the ice so it's

kind of like an extra layer of physical

punishment with this one and as I said

these are souls are bodies that are

completely Trapped Under Ice under this

Frozen ice Lake that we have in the

deepest pit of Hell so now that I've

gone through where I suspect this show

is heading to which is the ninth circle

of hell to the Frozen Abyss the frozen

lake let's have a look at some of the

imagery in the show that supports all of

this

Frozen

symbolism so starting with in the

opening sequence of season 2 we see many

marks trapped on this frozen lake that's

kind of melting away and then of course

with this latest episode what do we

see we are

outside in the middle of a frozen lake

that Earth wakes up on

guys guys this is literally coitus it is

the frozen lake within

hell the imagery

symbolism is literally telling us what

it is and of course as we know this is a

show that is set in Winter it is a

winter season show so everything in the

outside world has this snow Frozen

winter imagery and then we have to look

inside Lumen at all of this Frozen

winter

imagery everything on the severed floor

is pure white what is Len's color it is

blue everything is white and blue and

all of this white and blue imagery

representing Lumen and the severed

floor it's all giving that still sterile

cold landscape where nothing changes

which is obviously like what I said

about them in season 1 being trapped in

limbo but also how it connects to maybe

the end point of this story of this show

of ending up in the ninth Frozen circle

of hell and then of course we have the

imagery which is all connected as well

of things like the artwork in milch's

office this is an iceberg and then the

following images I'm about to go through

I got from a Reddit post which I will

link in the description below if you

want to check it out yourself but here

in the first image in the left middle to

bottom corner we see what looks like K

Egan's head and it seems to be maybe

wrapped in bubble wrap or something but

it looks like his head is maybe Frozen

in ice then there's obviously the

symbolism of Mark's head looking like

it's inside a frozen cube of ice the K

Eagan head on the wall being lit up with

Lum and blue we've of course got the

snow imagery that we already saw in the

opening sequence for season 2 and it's

also in season 1's opening credits it's

full of snow everywhere because like I

said this is a show set in wintertime

you've obviously got so many shots of

ice melting throughout all the episodes

and of course the Lumen logo is a water

drop or is it a

teardrop same difference right but it's

still this

water ice Frozen symbolism which is just

everywhere and another thing to mention

about this Frozen symbolism that's

everywhere in this

show is the thing about icy roads so in

episode one of season 1 Mark nearly runs

into Helena and she says maybe keep your

eyes on the icy roads and then we also

find out that Gemma died in a car

crash and I think it's maybe just

suspected that maybe

she her car

slipped on an icy road which crashed

into a tree and then in the Lexington

letter Peggy ends up joining Lumen

after she was driving a school bus

and ended up

crashing because of a sudden patch of

black I now with this repeated imagery

of slippery Frozen and roads of paths

that are dangerous unpredictable and

impossible to remain in control of it

makes me

wonder if the roads themselves are shown

as being icy and dangerous what about

the path that our characters are on are

they actually heading towards this Ninth

Circle of Hell or are they already there

because as I said it seems like this

season is exploring the second circle of

hell which is lust at least that's what

they're doing story-wise thematically

but at the same time all of the visual

imagery we get on the outside world and

inside Lumen already

mirrors the Frozen Ninth Circle of hell

so is this journey this show taking us

somewhere even worse than what we've

seen so far or or have our characters

already been trapped in the final stage

of hell this entire time and this

obviously opens up so many more

questions right like is Lumen physically

preserving bodies or Consciousness or

even K himself locked away in ice if K

is locked away in ice physically is he

really this kind of God that should be

worshiped like what we're seeing or does

he represent Dante Satan who is trapped

at the bottom of his own frozen hell and

is this journey leading us to eventually

get to the Ninth Circle and if so does

that mean our characters are going to

end up Frozen in place stuck in some

Eternal state of Stillness where they're

forever owned by Lumen into

perpetuity or what if that's already

what's happening what if they are

already prisoners of hell

and they can never escape and we have to

remember if the Ninth Circle is all

about

treachery then I guess the real question

is who is going to betray who before all

of this is over because if we are

following Dante's Journey then betrayal

is going to be the ultimate sin in the

severance world so who is going to be

the betrayer who will be condemned to to

this frozen lake Abyss forever anyway

Severance and Dante’s Inferno: Parallels in Punishment and Control
Hellish Imagery and Punishment in Severance

From its very first episode title (“Good News About Hell”), Severance deliberately evokes infernal themes. The Lumon corporation’s severed floor is an underworld of its own – employees must descend via elevator into a windowless maze of sterile corridors, suggesting a literal descent into hell. Symbolic cues reinforce this: the lead character Helly’s very name echoes “Hell,” and she sports flame-red hair. Religious and mythological references abound (e.g. allusions to Persephone and goat symbolism), cultivating what one critic calls an unmistakable “underworld vibe” in the series. Inside Lumon, the environment runs on strict rules, surveillance, and penitential punishments: for instance, employees who misbehave are sent to the Break Room, a chamber where they must endlessly recite apologies until deemed sincere – a psychological torture ritual that recalls the punitive, repetitive suffering of Dante’s damned souls. The whole system of merits and demerits, constant monitoring by “creepy supervisors,” and cultish obedience at Lumon creates a punitive atmosphere much like Dante’s hellish realm. In short, Severance paints the workplace as a kind of hell-on-earth, where punishment and control are the defining features.

Corporate Control as Modern Inferno

Severance’s core premise – severing a person’s work identity from their personal self – results in a dystopian form of eternal punishment for the “innie.” Scholars and critics note that each severed worker lives “a perpetual sequence of 9–5 workdays” with no reprieve
nrftsjournal.org
. From the innie’s perspective, the moment they leave the office elevator, they immediately re-enter to start a new workday, ad infinitum. This endless cycle of labor with “no days off, no vacations” has been aptly described as “a Dante’s Inferno-esque repetition of the mundane workday”
alyssawinn.com
. In Dante’s Inferno, the damned are condemned to endure fitting torments forever; in Severance, the innies are effectively condemned to endless office drudgery. The show underscores this cruel irony through its imagery and dialogue. For example, a company handbook invocation – “May Kier’s mercy follow you into the eternal dark” – prompted one commentator to recall the famous inscription above Dante’s Hell: “Abandon all hope, you who enter here”. The innies indeed abandon hope of escape; they cannot even die or sleep to get relief, since their consciousness only knows the office. This uncanny punishment of ceaseless work aligns with theological notions of hell as the absence of rest or grace. As one analysis observes, Severance “captures the woe that would be an existence of only labor – no rest, no weekend, no leisure,” which is essentially a vision of hellish life. In these respects, the show’s depiction of corporate control powerfully parallels Dante’s portrayal of Hell as a place of relentless suffering.

Identity, Fragmentation, and Psychological Suffering

A key infernal aspect in both Severance and Dante’s Inferno is the destruction of personal agency and identity. In Dante’s poem, souls in Hell are trapped in the identities shaped by their sins, often physically transformed or confined in ways that reflect their inner flaws (for example, fortune-tellers have their heads twisted backward as punishment for trying to see ahead). This loss of autonomy and self-determination finds a modern echo in Severance: Lumon’s severance procedure literally fragments a person’s identity by splitting them into “innie” (work self) and “outie” (personal self). The innie has no memories or knowledge outside of work, leaving them in a perpetual present with no context or hope of change. As a Psychology Today commentary notes, Lumon exerts “near-total control” over the innies’ ability to think critically about their situation – by wiping their memories, the company robs them of the personal history and inner resources that might allow resistance. This creates a psychological state akin to Dantean despair: the innies initially cannot imagine an alternative to their reality, much as the damned in Inferno cannot conceive of redemption.

 

The methods of control on the severed floor intensify this psychological suffering. Lumon manipulates its workers through a mix of coercive punishment and absurd rewards, a tactic common in cults or totalitarian systems. For example, transgressions result in the traumatizing Break Room sessions (a form of mental torment to break one’s will), while good behavior is rewarded with bizarrely trivial treats – a “Music Dance Experience,” melon bars, or the infamous “Waffle Party”. These incentives are “absurdly low-stakes perks designed to suppress critical thought and maintain obedience”. The dynamic recalls Dante’s contrapasso (punishments that ironically fit the sin) but with a darkly satirical twist: here the “sin” is simply disobedience or low productivity, and the punishment is being forced into creepy pseudo-penance or being denied any sense of self-worth. Over time, such an environment breeds learned helplessness – the innies, subjected to constant control, may stop trying to escape or resist, much as Dante’s sinners are resigned to their fates. This psychological conditioning is central to Lumon’s power, and it parallels the Inferno’s ultimate mechanism of entrapment: not chains or locks, but the utter absence of hope and agency.

Dante’s Inferno and Modern Parallels: Scholarly Insights

Dante’s Inferno is structured around nine circles of Hell, each defined by a particular category of sin and a fitting form of punishment (the principle of contrapasso, or “counter-suffering”). For example, the lustful are blown about by endless winds, the gluttonous wallow in muddy mire, and traitors are frozen in ice – each punishment symbolically reflects the sin’s nature. Crucially, Dante’s Hell is a realm of divine justice: the punishments, harsh as they are, serve a moral order where souls reap what they sowed. Another defining feature of Dante’s Hell is its absolute hopelessness. At Hell’s gate, Dante famously sees the inscription “Abandon all hope, you who enter here,” signaling that the damned are eternally cut off from God’s mercy and can never escape their fate. Hell is, in a spiritual sense, the ultimate state of separation – from God, from joy, and even from the fullness of one’s own humanity. Scholarly interpretations often emphasize this disintegration of the self in Hell: sinners become slaves to their worst impulses, their identities effectively reduced to the sin that damned them, and they exist in a static cycle of suffering without growth or change.

 

When comparing this to Severance, some parallels hold strongly, while others diverge. The show indeed captures a version of contrapasso, but one driven by corporate logic rather than divine justice. In Lumon’s office hell, the “sin” being punished is not a moral failing but rather the inherent human need for freedom and wholeness – a need that the company brutally suppresses. The result is a kind of inverted justice: innocent people (the employees) are tormented to serve corporate ends. This contrasts with Dante’s framework, where punishment is meant to be deserved and just. Nonetheless, the effect on the individual is analogous. Just as Dante’s sinners are stuck in a punishment that mirrors their defining act, Lumon’s innies are stuck in a life that mirrors corporate drudgery taken to the absolute extreme – “an existence of only labor”, which one commentator notes is essentially the opposite of the heavenly ideal of rest and thus a vision of hell.

 

It’s worth noting that Dante’s Inferno is only the first part of a larger journey (which continues upward through Purgatory and into Paradise). Hell in the Divine Comedy represents recognition of sin and the necessity of rejecting it. Severance is not a theological allegory in that sense, but it does involve its characters gradually recognizing the sinister reality of Lumon’s system and attempting to reject it. In a way, Mark and his colleagues function a bit like Dante navigating Hell – they learn the rules of this dark world and seek a way to break out. Unlike Dante’s damned, the innies still have the possibility of redemption or escape, which introduces a more hopeful dimension absent from Dante’s Hell. Some have even suggested the Severed floor might ultimately resemble not just Inferno but also a kind of Purgatory, if the characters are able to struggle toward freedom. At this stage, however, the show’s world remains firmly hellish in tone, with only glimmers of hope coming from the characters’ defiance rather than from any merciful design of the system.

Validity of the Inferno Theory: Well-Founded vs. Speculative

The theory that Severance parallels Dante’s Inferno finds solid support in several aspects of the show, but it can become speculative if pushed too far. On the well-founded side:

Hellish Themes and Atmosphere: The series intentionally fills Lumon with hell imagery and themes of judgment. The elevator descent, the “Good News About Hell” episode, Helly’s name, and repeated references to darkness vs. light all suggest the creators want us to think of a journey into Hell. Critics and scholars likewise note that the severed life is a “hell on earth” of division and suffering. In this broad sense, Severance is undoubtedly using Hell as a metaphor for the dehumanizing extreme of corporate control.

Punishment and Control Tactics: Many specific elements in Severance echo the structure of infernal punishment. The Break Room’s forced repentance ritual, the constant surveillance and fear of the mysterious “Testing Floor,” and the endless monotony of work are directly analogous to torments and psychological prisons. The fact that innies experience relentless toil with no hope of rest or relief is explicitly compared to Dante’s concept of an unending punishment
alyssawinn.com
. These parallels are well-substantiated in commentary: for example, Severance’s workers “enslave a part of themselves, dooming [that part] to…repetition of the mundane workday” – essentially a corporate twist on Dante’s eternal damnation
alyssawinn.com
.

Loss of Self/Hope: The fragmentation of identity and induced hopelessness in Lumon’s employees aligns with infernal themes recognized by scholars. Theologically, hell is the ultimate separation (from goodness and self), and Severance makes that literal by separating the person’s mind. The innie/outie split creates a scenario in which the innie is trapped in a controlled environment, “unable to imagine an alternative” to their situation. This resonates with Dante’s damned souls, who are likewise trapped in the state they entered Hell with, incapable of envisioning redemption. The show’s frequent hints at lost hope (Helly’s suicide attempt when she sees no way out, for instance) bolster the inferno comparison.

However, other aspects of the Dante theory are more speculative or metaphorical:

One-to-One Mappings: The video creator’s theory positing that Lumon’s structure corresponds to Dante’s nine circles (e.g. each department or scenario aligning with a specific sin’s punishment) is intriguing but not clearly supported by evidence so far. While Lumon’s “nine core principles” and other uses of the number nine invite speculation, there’s no explicit indication in Season 1 that, say, nine distinct punishment zones exist, or that each character represents a particular sin. This kind of granular mapping risks over-interpreting coincidences. For instance, the presence of baby goats on the severed floor sparked theories of a circle of violence or fraud (since Dante’s seventh circle includes violent sinners and heretics, and goats might symbolize the damned). But within the show, the goats remain an unexplained oddity; any alignment with Dante’s Hell at that level is conjecture. Until the story develops further, the nine-circles framework remains an unconfirmed fan theory
threads.net
 rather than a rigorously substantiated parallel.

Moral Framework Differences: Dante’s Inferno is fundamentally about moral justice – each soul suffers a fate earned by their choices. Severance, by contrast, is a critique of corporate oppression where the suffering is unjustly imposed on innocents. Equating Lumon’s employees with Dante’s sinners can be problematic, because the show doesn’t suggest the innies deserve their torment in the way Dante’s sinners do. In fact, if anything, Lumon’s executives (like the Eagans) are closer to being “sinners” inflicting hell on others. The video theory might stretch analogies by trying to cast characters in Dante’s roles (for example, seeing Mark Scout as a Dante figure journeying through hell, or Kier Eagan as a Satan-esque figure at the center of it). While Mark’s journey does mirror aspects of Inferno (he’s increasingly aware of the horrors around him and seeks to escape, much like Dante travels through Hell learning its nature), Severance is not a moral allegory in the way The Divine Comedy is. Any direct character-to-character comparison (e.g. “Mark is Dante, Irving is Virgil guiding him,” etc.) goes beyond what scholarly analysis has endorsed – these are creative parallels fans draw, but they remain speculative without confirmation from the text or creators.

Scope of the Allegory: The Inferno theory focuses on the Hell-like qualities of Severance, but scholars note that the show’s themes also connect with real-world psychology and socio-political critiques (workplace control, loss of agency, capitalist exploitation)
psychologytoday.com
alyssawinn.com
. In other words, the Inferno lens is just one way to interpret the symbolism. Severance may draw inspiration from Dante, but it equally owes to dystopian literature, modern psychology, and workplace satire. Overemphasizing Dante could understate these other influences. For example, the feel of Lumon’s bureaucracy often satirizes corporate culture in a way reminiscent of Kafka or Orwell, which is a separate lineage of critique from Dante’s religious vision. No published academic study has definitively tied Severance’s every element to Inferno; most commentary treats the hell imagery as one reference point among many.

In summary, the idea that Severance parallels Dante’s Inferno is compelling and partially validated: the show unmistakably invokes Hell to illuminate the psychological and ethical horror of its corporate setting. Academic and critical discussions support many of these connections – highlighting the show’s depiction of endless punishment, loss of hope, and fractured identity as a veritable modern Hell
alyssawinn.com
. However, the interpretation should be applied with nuance. The most convincing links are the thematic ones (eternal torment, control, despair), whereas an exact structural allegory (mapping Lumon to all nine circles or equating characters to Dante’s figures) remains speculative. As one writer puts it, Severance uses a “labyrinthine” office and encased work-life to hold up a dark mirror to our own world

. That mirror clearly reflects hellish aspects, but it is not confined to Dante’s imagery alone. The theory is well-founded in spirit – Severance does portray a corporate hell – yet any rigid one-to-one Dante comparison may be more metaphorical flourish than literal design. Future seasons or creator commentary may either reinforce or undermine these Dantean parallels, but based on current scholarly analysis, the hell metaphor is apt while the specific Inferno mapping should be viewed as an intriguing but unproven fan interpretation.
