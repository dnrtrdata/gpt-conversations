The best Callisto Protocol settings on PC
Looking to boost fps in the Dead Space spiritual successor? Our best Callisto Protocol settings guide will help your gaming PC survive the horror game's demands



Phil Hayton
Published: Dec 5, 2022
PC games hardware The Callisto Protocol 
The best Callisto Protocol settings will help bring the gorefest to life on your gaming PC, and they'll prevent the horror game from turning into a slideshow. The spiritual Dead Space successor's visuals are a huge part of the experience, so you'll want to dial things in to strike a perfect balance.

Before attempting to escape the Black Iron Prison, it's worth checking out The Callisto Protocol system requirements. Doing so will help prepare your rig for the wretched horrors that await, especially if you aren't rocking the best graphics card around. That said, don't sweat it if your system doesn't match Striking Distance's recommended specs, as settings tweaks can boost fps and make playing the best horror game contender more enjoyable.

Again, you don't need the best gaming PC to run Callisto Protocol, and our handy settings guide will help survival horror shine. It's worth noting that you should use the following options as a baseline, as you might be able to squeeze more frames and improve fidelity by experimenting.

PCGamesN test rig: MSI MPG Trident AS 11th gaming PC, featuring an Intel Core i7 11700F, MSI Ventus Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, 32GB of DDR4 3,200MHz RAM, MSI B560 motherboard, and Windows 11.



The Callisto Protocol graphics Presets
Sticking with The Callisto Protocol presets is an easy way to balance performance, fidelity, and effects. In keeping with settings tradition, the game features low, medium, high, and ultra options, all of which automatically adjust each toggle.

The presets in question don't quite translate the way you'd think, as most graphics options cap out at 'high'. In other words, switching to ultra won't necessarily ramp up settings, but it'll switch things on like AMD FSR 2 'Quality' mode, rather than 'Performance'.

It's worth noting that during testing, we ran into a few preset hiccups, as the game would selectively jump back to a previous preset after selection. Switching back and forth occasionally rectifies the issue, but it makes changing presets a bit fiddly.


Ultimately, presets are best served as a starting point rather than a comprehensive settings solution. You'll see a big difference in frame rates when jumping between each, but adjusting each toggle separately will eliminate unnecessary compromises.



The best Callisto Protocol graphics settings
Here are the best Callisto Protocol graphics settings on PC:

V-Sync: Off
Framerate limit: Unlimited
Fullscreen mode: Fullscreen
Lighting: High
Shadows: High
Volumetrics: High
Particles: High
Textures: High
Screen space reflections: Enabled
Physical refractions: Enabled
Depth of field: Enabled
Motion blur: Disabled
Subsurface scattering: Enabled
Anti-aliasing: TemportalAA
Film grain: Off
Lighting
Just like Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol's sinister sci-fi setting is drenched in eerie lighting effects. It's needless to say that sticking with 'standard' will help preserve the survival horror's atmospheric effects, but switching to 'low' will free up frames. We'd consider this to be a last resort, as it'll have an impact on the game's intrinsic visuals. Nevertheless, the option is there if you've got fps woes.



Shadows
Lighting and shadows go hand in hand, so you'll want to follow the same approach in terms of adjustments. However, you'll be able to choose 'medium' this time around, which eliminates the previous all-or-nothing approach used by the previous setting. Still, opting for 'high' will produce the best visual results, and we'd only advise dialling down if you're struggling to hit 60fps.

Particles
Experiencing jitters and frame spikes? Particle effects might be responsible, as blood splatters and weird floaty space things will challenge your graphics card. Choosing medium over high won't dramatically affect overall fidelity, but if you're a gorehound or you're really into subtle details, you'll likely notice a difference. Still, it's worth doing if you're experiencing temperamental performance, and it'll contribute to higher frames.

Textures
Do you like sticking your character's face up against walls to gaze at the detail? Then you'll want to leave The Callisto Protocol's texture settings alone. Just keep in mind that high-quality textures will potentially put more strain on your CPU and GPU than anything else within this guide, and the effect's medium settings aren't an offence to the eyes.



Resolution
Reducing resolution should always be the last resort, but it'll help your rig churn out more frames in The Callisto Protocol. Naturally, if your setup includes the best gaming monitor, you won't want to drift too far from native resolution, particularly if you're using a 4K panel.

Ray tracing
Enabling ray tracing in The Callisto Protocol will pile the pressure on your PC, especially if you're playing at 4K with ultra settings enabled. If you're not fussed about fancy lighting, leaving it off will make hitting an acceptable frame rate easier, all while still enjoying full-blown settings.

But hey, The Callisto Protocol ray tracing looks pretty spectacular, so if you're looking to fully embrace the tech, we'd suggest trimming your resolution down (providing you're not using a 1080p display). You could mess with shadows and lighting to make some performance room, but if you're that into visuals, you're likely not the type to play with low settings enabled.



The Callisto Protocol accessibility settings
The Callisto Protocol has a dedicated accessibility settings menu, and it features the following categories:

High-contrast
Combat assists
UI options
Screen options
Splitting up each option into specific categories is a boon, as it makes accessibility functions easy to locate and enable. Whether you're looking to reduce screen shaking or enable automatic assists, Striking Distance Studios has implemented a variety of aids that should help more players explore the game's putrid prison with ease.

Still deciding whether to pick up Krafton's sci-fi scarefest? Our Callisto Protocol review examines how it pays tribute to the legacy of Dead Space, despite falling short in the story department.

   - For Steam: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Callisto Protocol\TheCallistoProtocol\Content\Movies
   - For Epic Games: C:\Program Files\Epic Games\TheCallistoProtocol\TheCallistoProtocol\Content\Movies

2. Rename or move the following files to disable intro videos:
   - AMD_Logo_4K.bk2
   - Bink_Krafton_SDS_Logos.bk2
   - Intro_logo_Krafton_SDS.bk2
   - Krafton_SDS_logos_4k.bk2
   - Unreal_InstaLOD_logos.bk2
   - Unreal_Logo_4K.bk2
   - Wwise_InstaLOD_Logos_4K.bk2

3. Alternatively, modify the Game.ini file:
   - Location: C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\CallistoProtocol\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\Game.ini
   - Add the following lines:
     [/script/movieplayer.movieplayersettings]
     bWaitForMoviesToComplete=False
     bMoviesAreSkippable=True
     StartupMovies=

   - Set the Game.ini file to 'Read Only' to prevent the game from overwriting these settings.

III. Considerations:

- Ensure that the game has completed its initial shader compilation before removing intro videos to avoid startup issues.
- Back up original files before making changes to easily revert if necessary.
- Monitor the game's performance after modifications to ensure stability.

   - In the Tracy Profiler, your Unreal project should appear in the list of discovered clients.
   - Double-click your project to start profiling.

3. Instrument your code for detailed profiling:
   - Include 'Tracy.hpp' in your C++ files.
   - Use 'ZoneScoped;' to profile a code block.
   - Use 'FrameMark;' to mark the end of a frame.
   - Example:
     void MyFunction()
     {
         ZoneScoped;
         // Your code here
     }

4. Analyze profiling data:
   - Use the Tracy Profiler interface to examine CPU usage, frame timings, and other performance metrics.
   - Utilize features like flame graphs and memory allocation tracking for in-depth analysis.

III. Additional Tips

- Ensure that your firewall allows communication between your Unreal project and the Tracy Profiler.
- For GPU profiling, additional setup is required; refer to Tracy's documentation for guidance.
- Regularly update the Tracy Profiler and plugin to benefit from the latest features and improvements.

Is this optimized under the assumption that I am profiling a game that I cannot actively modify c++ code and only have access intended for the end user of a game developed in UE4, and not a project I am currently developing or modifying with elevated permission?
--------------------------------------

Copy code
No, the current setup process assumes full source-level access to a UE4 project, including the ability to integrate plugins, modify C++ code, and recompile the engine or project binaries. That workflow is not suitable for profiling a compiled retail game like The Callisto Protocol, which is closed-source and provides no debugging hooks or build-time integration points.

If you're limited to end-user access (i.e., no source code, no developer console, no debug symbols), then the Tracy Profiler cannot be used to its full extent. Tracy requires instrumentation within the codebase to provide detailed zone-level and function-specific CPU timing, which retail games do not expose.

For a game like The Callisto Protocol (UE4, Steam, retail build), use the following tools instead:

I. RenderDoc
   - GPU frame debugger that works without code access.
   - Can capture a frame from DirectX 12 games like Callisto Protocol and analyze draw calls, resource bindings, and shader usage.
   - Ideal for diagnosing GPU-side issues like overdraw, pipeline bottlenecks, or redundant state changes.

II. PresentMon + Intel PresentMon GUI
   - Lightweight, user-mode DirectX and Vulkan frame presentation monitor.
   - Captures frametime graphs, latency stats, dropped frames, and stutter metrics in real-time.
   - GUI overlay available (Intel PresentMon) for ease of use.

III. Windows Performance Toolkit (WPR + WPA)
   - Native Windows system profiler.
   - Can capture detailed traces of CPU, GPU (via GPUView), disk I/O, and memory usage during gameplay.
   - Ideal for long-session profiling and identifying systemic bottlenecks or background contention.

IV. NVIDIA Nsight Systems (or Nsight Graphics)
   - Nsight Systems: for system-wide latency and CPU/GPU synchronization analysis.
   - Nsight Graphics: for GPU-specific resource usage and draw call tracking in DX12 titles.
   - Does not require game modification, but DX12 support in some games may be limited depending on how UE4 compiled it.

V. CapFrameX
   - High-precision frametime analyzer for gamers and testers.
   - Works well with PresentMon backend.
   - Offers advanced metrics visualization and CSV logging.

Recommendation:
If you’re profiling The Callisto Protocol as a non-developer end user, use **PresentMon + Intel PresentMon GUI** or **CapFrameX** for general performance logging and **RenderDoc** or **Nsight Graphics** for deep GPU analysis. They require no engine access and work on retail builds.

Make the following easily digestible in the form of a web article with thorough, dense paragraphs as a format:
Explanation of different performance metrics
5/31/20 by Taxxor

Frametimes, FPS, median, percentiles, x% low ?
If you have ever looked at game benchmarks on the internet, you might have come across all these terms. But what exactly is hidden behind them is probably not clear to everyone and that's why we want to provide some clarity.

 

Frametimes: How is the performance of games measured?
In order to understand what the various metrics mean, it's important to know what data is being used in the first place.
Ingame benchmark tools, OCAT, FRAPS, PresentMon, CapFrameX - all these tools ultimately give the user FPS values, but these are not the values that are being measured.
What is measured are the time intervals between the individual images: The frametimes.

The measured frametimes are used to calculate the FPS, the formula is simple:

FPS = 1000 / frametimes
Frametimes = 1000 / FPS

As you can see, the FPS are nothing but the inverted values of the respective frametimes, so high frametimes mean low FPS while low frametimes mean high FPS.

All performance metrics are calculated based on the raw data of every measured frametime converted into an FPS value.

 

Percentiles
This term appears in many tests, the description always varies a little bit, from "Xth Percentile", "X% Percentile", "PX" or even more rarely just "X%".

But what they express is always the same, namely the value for which X% of all remaining values are smaller than this.

For game benchmarks this means: If my bench has 1000 different values and I sort these 1000 values from the smallest(1) to the largest(1000) value, the 99th percentile is the value at the 990th place, the 95th percentile is the value at the 950th place and so on.

So percentiles are not about times, but only about frames. Often you read explanations that a P1 of 45fps means that you are above 45fps 99% of the time. In practice, this is usually very close to the truth, but still not correct, because it only says that 99% of the rendered frames were above 45fps.

An extreme example: Let's assume we make a 20s recording with a P1 of 45fps. The ignored 1% of the frames now contain four huge outliers of 500ms each, so at least 10% of the time we were below 45fps(4 times of half a second without any moving image ).
CapFrameX also offers a view to make this fact visible, if you look at the threshold tab on the Analysis page you can see the total time spent below certain thresholds.

 

Median
A special form of the percentile, which is rarely seen, is the median. This is the 50th percentile and thus the value that is exactly in the middle of the list sorted from small to large.
This makes the median insensitive to outliers that are very large but small in numbers, since it is always in the middle of the total number of frames, while the normal average is also influenced by the values of the individual frames.
If a game runs generally smooth this median is almost equal to the average of all values(average FPS).

 

Why use percentiles?
Percentiles are used in benchmarks to deliberately set a boundary above which values are ignored. This is especially useful for the "min FPS" values that were often used in the past, which are increasingly replaced by the 1st percentile.

The min FPS always indicated the lowest FPS value (i.e. the highest frametime value) that was measured over the complete benchmark.
Since the very worst frame is influenced by all sorts of things and can therefore vary greatly, it is not suitable for comparing the performance of different hardware.
The same is true for min FPS values that state the lowest FPS value averaged over one complete second. With this you can not see any outliers or micro-stutters.

If you take the 1st percentile instead and ignore the lowest 1% of the FPS values, you get a value that is much more stable and can be used to compare different hardware.

Moreover, it is also not very helpful for the private user to see a "min FPS" value that is based on a single outlier that occurred at a point where it is not representative for the gaming experience. With the P1, on the other hand, the user gets a value that is much closer to the minimum that he actively perceives during gaming.
And with the exclusion of upper and lower outliers, one can see quite well over the span between P1 and P99, even without a graph, how smooth the scene was.

If you want to ignore less outliers, because it turned out that the remaining frames are quite stable, you can switch to P0.2 or even P0.1, whereby you should have more than 1000 frames in your benchmark, so that at least 2-3 frames are dropped in the end.

 

Indication of percentiles and misleading information
We've already explained above that precentiles are not about time but about number of frames. Furthermore they don't form a "rating" by themselfes. How the values are sorted is not based on good or bad but always strictly from small to large and the respective percentile always describes that this percentage of values is smaller than the specified value.

This leads to the fact that the percentile to be used also changes depending on whether one is talking about frame times or FPS.

With FPS low values are bad, with frametimes low values are good.
So if you want to have the bad FPS values, you have to search for either high frametime values or low FPS values, so for example the 99th percentile of frametimes (99% of the values are lower) corresponds to the 1st percentile of FPS (99% of the values are higher).

Many sites still use the 99th percentile, even though they specify the values themselves in FPS, thus meaning the 1st percentile instead. For some reason this seems to have become common practice because most started out using frametime values for which P99 was the right description and now switched to FPS without adjusting the percentile (we're advocating for more sites using the correct description).
Some write "frametimes in FPS" behind it to make it a bit clearer what they are doing, namely take the 99th percentile of the frametimes and then convert and output this value in FPS, which would make it the 1st percentile of FPS according to absolutely correct formulation.


An aggravating factor is the fact that some ingame benchmarks use the term "min FPS", but refer to the 5th percentile, whereas elsewhere the 1st percentile or the actual min FPS is meant.

Therefore, for any kind of comparison, the following applies: Discuss which tools you use and especially which metrics you use. Otherwise, person A will wonder why their alleged min FPS, which the integrated benchmark has given them, are so much better than the min FPS that person B has determined with CapFrameX, OCAT etc.

 

x% low
You find this information very often, especially internationally, many tech-youtubers use it and the MSI Afterburner also spits out these metrics. Furthermore they are always used in connection with FPS and not with frametimes, so the low clearly refers to low and therefore bad FPS.

Compared to percentiles, there is no clear definition of how x% low values are to be calculated so here it is even more important to be clear about the tool or method you're using when comparing these values with others.


In some cases, with 1% low at 1000 values, the average of the 10 lowest values is calculated. This way, every outlier, no matter how small, is included in this value and the result is always lower than the 1st percentile.

The benefits of this approach may be debatable, there are advantages and disadvantages for both metrics. Some would like to have outliers of 1-2 frames in their evaluation, others do not want that and therefore take the percentiles.

It also depends on whether these outliers occur reproducibly or not. If a 0.1% low value is taken from only 2-3 frames and the benchmark scene has one or two frames randomly spiking in some runs without any connection to the hardware or settings used, you'll get a different result every time and therefor can't use 0.1% low to make any assumptions about the performance of the tested hardware or settings.

 

MSI Afterburner for example uses a different approach in which the x% low value is more similar to the percentile value but instead of counting frames, it's counting time.  CapFrameX is also using this approach as of version 1.5.3

If the 1000 value benchmark from above took 20s in total, the frametimes get sorted from highest to lowest, so just like with the percentiles but reversed.

For 1% low starting at the first(highest) value in that list the frametime values are added one by one until their sum reaches or exceeds 1% of the total benchmark time, in this case 200ms. The converted FPS value of the frame that reached or exceeded that 200ms spot, will be the 1% low and compared to the standard 1% percentile, with this one you can really say that you are above X FPS 99% of the time.

 

Update 8/10/22:

With version 1.7.0 CapFrameX will offer both of the x% low approaches mentioned above. They will be called "x% low average" for the average of the lowest x% of values and "x% low integral" for the value that you were below for x% of total benchmark time.
 

Additional info: percentiles for odd values
For those who would like to know a little bit more: What happens if you don't have exactly 1000 frames, but at 1070 FPS values you get 10.7 as 1st percentile? Some tools always round off to the next lower value, in this case 10, in order to make the values a little worse than a little too good. Some do exactly the opposite and some round up or down depending on the decimal point.

Others use mathematical formulas (too complicated for this explanation) to include the surrounding frametimes in the calculation of the final value and thus obtain a value that could have been at this theoretical position.

CapFrameX works in this way, so you will rarely see a value for the percentiles that actually appears as a number in the raw data.

Here, differences in the range of usually up to 0,5fps between the tools can occur, even if you would give all of them the same raw data, simply because the way of calculation is not 100% identical.

Understanding performance metrics is crucial for accurately assessing gaming performance. This guide breaks down key concepts like frametimes, FPS, percentiles, and "x% low" metrics, providing insights into their significance and how they relate to each other.

Frametimes: The Foundation of Performance Metrics

Frametimes measure the duration between consecutive frames during gameplay, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms). They serve as the raw data from which other performance metrics are derived. The relationship between frametimes and frames per second (FPS) is inversely proportional:

FPS = 1000 / frametime (in ms)
GitHub

For instance, a frametime of 16.67 ms corresponds to 60 FPS. Lower frametimes indicate smoother performance, while higher frametimes can result in noticeable stuttering.

FPS: Averages and Their Limitations

FPS represents the number of frames rendered per second. While average FPS provides a general sense of performance, it doesn't capture frame pacing consistency. Two gaming sessions might have identical average FPS but differ significantly in smoothness due to variations in frametime consistency.

Percentiles: Assessing Frame Consistency

Percentiles offer a statistical approach to understanding performance consistency. The 1st percentile (P1) FPS indicates that 99% of frames were rendered faster than this value. This metric helps identify the lower bounds of performance, offering insights into potential stuttering or lag.
Reddit

It's essential to note that percentiles focus on the distribution of frame times rather than specific time durations. For example, a P1 of 45 FPS means that 99% of frames were rendered faster than 22.22 ms (1000 / 45).

Median: The Middle Ground

The median frametime or FPS represents the middle value in a sorted list of all frame times or FPS values. Unlike the average, the median is less affected by extreme outliers, providing a more robust measure of central tendency, especially in scenarios with occasional performance spikes or drops.

"x% Low" Metrics: Understanding Performance Dips

"x% low" metrics, such as 1% low or 0.1% low, indicate the average FPS of the lowest-performing x% of frames. These metrics help identify performance dips that might not significantly impact average FPS but can affect the gaming experience.

There are two primary methods to calculate "x% low" metrics:

Frame Count-Based Approach: Calculates the average FPS of the slowest x% of frames.

Time-Based Approach: Determines the FPS value below which x% of the total gameplay time was spent.

Tools like CapFrameX offer both methods, labeled as "x% low average" and "x% low integral," respectively.

Importance of Consistent Metrics

When comparing performance metrics across different tools or reports, it's crucial to ensure consistency in calculation methods. Discrepancies can arise if one source uses frame count-based percentiles while another employs time-based calculations. Clarifying the methodology ensures accurate comparisons and interpretations.

By understanding these performance metrics, gamers and developers can gain deeper insights into game performance, leading to more informed decisions regarding hardware upgrades, game settings, and optimization strategies.

How do these metrics help me best analyze my Callisto protocol game performance?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:

Copy code
Understanding frametimes, percentiles, and x% low metrics is essential for evaluating how The Callisto Protocol actually feels to play—not just how it looks on paper. Here's how each metric applies to your performance analysis:

I. Frametimes: Detecting Smoothness vs. Stutter
The Callisto Protocol, as a graphically intense UE4 title using DX12 and ray tracing, can suffer from inconsistent frame pacing even if the average FPS seems acceptable. Frametimes help you detect those inconsistencies. For example, even if you’re getting 60 FPS, if frametimes are wildly fluctuating (say, from 12ms to 40ms), gameplay may feel jittery or stuttery—especially during cutscenes, explosions, or large streaming transitions. A consistent frametime (ideally hovering steadily around 16.7ms for 60 FPS) ensures that your experience feels fluid.

II. FPS Average: Baseline Performance Indicator
The average FPS metric helps you gauge your system's general throughput. While it's often the headline figure, it's misleading without context. In The Callisto Protocol, ray tracing effects and volumetric lighting can tank performance briefly—so average FPS might be 60, but momentary dips or spikes can ruin immersion. Use it only in conjunction with percentile and low metrics.

III. 1% and 0.1% Low FPS: Quantifying the Worst-Case Performance
These are critical for identifying momentary hitches or stutters in The Callisto Protocol. A 1% low of 45 FPS means the bottom 1% of your frame rates dip to 45, which may still feel smooth. However, a 0.1% low of 25 FPS suggests major stutter spikes are occurring, possibly due to asset streaming, shader compilation, or VRAM overflow—especially on your 8GB 4070.

CapFrameX logs both the average and integral methods, giving you insight not just into outlier values, but how much time you're spending in those lower-performance states. This helps you know whether a few bad frames are irrelevant or symptomatic of an ongoing bottleneck.

IV. Percentiles: Filtering Out the Noise
Percentiles give you control over how much of the data you want to ignore in order to get a clearer performance picture. In The Callisto Protocol, a 95th percentile FPS of 58 and a 1st percentile of 42 tells you that performance is generally stable but dips occur. This helps pinpoint whether stuttering is frequent and worth fixing (like by lowering shadow quality or disabling SSR), or just occasional noise.

V. Median FPS: Cutting Through Outliers
Median is especially helpful in Callisto Protocol when scenes vary drastically in complexity. A few massively GPU-taxing moments (like large firefights with lighting effects) might pull down your average. Median lets you gauge "typical" frame performance, helping determine if performance is balanced or erratic.

VI. How These Help You Optimize
With these metrics, you can:
  - Identify the source of stutters (frametime spikes during asset streaming, post-process load, etc.)
  - Choose which graphical settings to reduce (e.g., high volumetrics might tank 1% lows more than it hurts average FPS)
  - Validate whether upscaling solutions like FSR 2 in Quality mode are doing their job
  - Compare test runs after enabling/disabling ray tracing or reducing lighting complexity
  - Export and compare logs after tweaking settings (e.g., test 5-minute gameplay sessions in the same area with different shadows or reflections settings)

Bottom line: these metrics empower you to stop guessing and start isolating *why* your performance degrades, whether it’s CPU-bound shader stalls, GPU memory limits, or poor scene management by the game engine.

[English (auto-generated)] Windows 11_ Let's Be Honest, There Are Big Issues, Right? [DownSub.com].txt
Document
Do any topics in the attached transcript highlight concerns for my testing goals for The Callisto Protocol or other pc titles on my rig?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


pgsql
Copy code
Yes, several concerns raised in the transcript are directly relevant to your goals of testing The Callisto Protocol and other high-fidelity PC titles on your MSI Crosshair 16 laptop. Here's a breakdown of specific risks and how they could distort or limit your performance analysis:

I. OS-Level Regression in Game or Hardware Performance
  - Windows 11 updates were noted to reduce performance on some newer CPU architectures (e.g., Arrow Lake, Zen 4/5).
  - Even though you're using a 14th-gen Intel CPU, future Windows updates could introduce instability or degradation in frame consistency, which might be misinterpreted as a game or GPU issue if not accounted for in your logs.
  - Takeaway: Maintain version-stable baselines during benchmarking. Always document your current Windows build number alongside CapFrameX logs.

II. Stability and Crash Issues with Games (e.g., Ubisoft Titles)
  - One section noted that some Windows 11 updates are causing Ubisoft games to crash. While The Callisto Protocol is not Ubisoft-published, this implies a broader DX12 or game-runtime compatibility issue introduced at the OS level.
  - Takeaway: If you experience inexplicable crashes, check recent KB patches before troubleshooting hardware or GPU settings.

III. GPU-Related Rendering Regression
  - The transcript mentioned changes to how Windows 11 handles "multi-plane overlays" (a GPU compositor-level feature for windowed rendering), which could disrupt frame pacing, cause overlay flicker, or skew DXGI PresentMon data.
  - Takeaway: Run your tests in exclusive fullscreen where possible to avoid compositor interference with frametime logging tools like CapFrameX or PresentMon.

IV. Shader Compilation and File Explorer Delays
  - Complaints about Windows Explorer being sluggish—even on NVMe—when browsing folders or launching apps may correlate to slow shader cache access or file access latency, which could extend level load times or even interfere with shader precompilation.
  - Takeaway: Use tools like LatencyMon or Windows Performance Analyzer if you notice long load times or pauses during shader compilation. These may be I/O bottlenecks introduced by Windows indexing or cloud hooks.

V. Background Process Interference
  - Several anecdotes describe spontaneous slowdowns, high RAM use, or unexplained crashes due to Windows services updating in the background (e.g., CoPilot, OneDrive integration).
  - Takeaway: When benchmarking, disable all unnecessary services and overlays. Use a clean boot profile and offline mode to limit system noise during test runs.

VI. Misleading “Min FPS” from Game Benchmarks
  - Some metrics labeled as "min FPS" by Windows-integrated benchmarks or tools like MSI Afterburner may actually refer to 5% or 1% lows—contributing to user confusion.
  - Takeaway: Prefer CapFrameX with CSV export and manually labeled percentile markers to ensure consistency across your test results.

VII. Storage Device Priority and External Drive Hangups
  - The system freezing or delaying access to internal SSDs when USB drives are connected is a real OS-level bottleneck. If you record logs, save screenshots, or use external tools during tests, this could delay frametime logging or break trace continuity.
  - Takeaway: Disconnect external drives or disable automatic spin-down during benchmarking sessions.

VIII. Persistent Shutdown Errors (e.g., with 7800X3D)
  - Errors related to Xbox subsystems were mentioned as appearing during shutdown, suggesting residual services may be active during gameplay too.
  - Takeaway: Consider disabling Game Bar, Xbox Game Services, and Microsoft Store auto-updates during test sessions to prevent background process interference.

In short, your Windows 11 environment can introduce measurable inaccuracies or instability during rigorous performance testing—especially in real-time FPS/frametime capture. For maximum reliability, document your Windows build, strip unnecessary services, and retest after each major update to avoid chasing phantom hardware problems caused by software regressions.
