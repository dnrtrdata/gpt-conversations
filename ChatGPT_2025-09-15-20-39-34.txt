Find out everything you can about writing fictional characters that are children or adolescent. I want the age range to be ~ when the average child learns to speak up to age 17 — right before you’re considered a legal adult in the United States. Be thorough, exhaustive, and verbose. Include everything you find.

Writing authentic and compelling child and adolescent characters—spanning from the age when children typically begin to speak (around one to two years old) up to 17 years—requires a nuanced understanding of their cognitive, emotional, and social development. This guide offers comprehensive insights into effectively portraying these characters in fiction.

Understanding Developmental Stages
Early Childhood (1–5 years)

Cognitive Development: Children in this age range are highly sensory-driven, understanding the world through direct experiences. Abstract thinking is minimal; their perceptions are concrete and literal. 
Creative Screenwriting

Language and Speech: Vocabulary expands rapidly. While early speech may include simple sentences, by age five, many children can engage in more complex conversations, though their understanding remains rooted in tangible concepts.

Emotional Expression: Emotions are intense and immediate. Young children may struggle with impulse control and often display their feelings openly.

Middle Childhood (6–12 years)

Cognitive Development: This stage marks the transition from concrete to more abstract thinking. Children begin to understand perspectives different from their own and can grasp complex ideas, though their reasoning is still developing.

Social Dynamics: Peer relationships gain importance. Children become more aware of social norms and may experience pressure to conform.

Interests and Hobbies: Individual preferences become pronounced. Children may develop specific hobbies or skills, reflecting their growing autonomy.
Bethany Henry

Adolescence (13–17 years)

Identity Formation: Teenagers actively explore and form their identities, often questioning authority and societal norms. This period is marked by a search for personal values and beliefs.

Emotional Complexity: Adolescents experience heightened emotions and may oscillate between childlike dependence and a desire for independence.

Social Relationships: Peer groups and romantic interests become central. Acceptance and belonging are significant motivators, influencing behavior and decision-making.

Crafting Authentic Child and Adolescent Characters

Individuality Over Stereotypes: Avoid reducing young characters to clichés such as the "precocious child" or the "rebellious teen." Instead, develop them as unique individuals with distinct personalities, motivations, and flaws. 
Helping Writers Become Authors

Age-Appropriate Goals and Motivations: Ensure that the character's desires and objectives align with their developmental stage. For instance, a seven-year-old might aspire to befriend a new classmate, while a 16-year-old could be focused on gaining independence through driving.

Realistic Dialogue: Children and teenagers communicate differently from adults. Their dialogue should reflect their age, experience, and social context without resorting to exaggerated slang or baby talk. Listening to real conversations among young people can inform authentic dialogue writing.

Balance Maturity and Naivety: Recognize that while adolescents may exhibit moments of maturity, they are still developing and can display naivety, especially in unfamiliar situations. This balance adds depth and realism to their character. 
Famous Writing Routines

Reflect Evolving Relationships: Depict the changing dynamics between young characters and their peers, family, and society. For example, teenagers often seek autonomy, leading to conflicts or negotiations with parental figures.

Avoid Adult Perspectives: When writing from a young character's viewpoint, refrain from inserting adult retrospection. The narrative should reflect the character's current understanding and emotions, not a matured reflection. 
Gotham Writers Workshop

Incorporate Growth and Change: Young characters are in a constant state of development. Show their growth through experiences that challenge their beliefs, leading to evolving perspectives and behaviors.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Overly Cutesy or Wise Characters: Steer clear of portraying children as unnaturally adorable or as possessing wisdom beyond their years. Such depictions can feel inauthentic and disconnect readers from the character.

Ignoring Peer Influence: Especially in adolescence, peers significantly impact behavior and choices. Neglecting this influence can result in a less credible portrayal.

Static Characters: Given that change is inherent in youth, presenting a young character without growth or learning experiences can feel unrealistic.

Misrepresenting Developmental Abilities: Ensure that the character's abilities and understanding are appropriate for their age. For instance, attributing advanced abstract reasoning to a five-year-old would be inaccurate.

Now I want every bit of info in the following transcript regarding the idea of “fuck you, tuck me in.”

foreign

first time that you hurt

someone like that

if you uh

when

I'm not good at this yeah you really

aren't I mean it was my fault

you shouldn't have had to

and I'm sorry

[Music]

welcome to the official podcast for

HBO's The Last of Us I'm your host Troy

Baker joining me now Craig Mason good to

be back Troy and Neil druckman hello

Troy Baker today we're going to be

discussing episode 4 titled please hold

to my hand

so that's a lyric from uh alone and

forsaken I mean that's that's a

carryover from the game we get alone and

forsaken yeah played in the truck yep on

the tape well he's got a gun and what I

loved is that we take a moment to show

she's really Adept at it like she she

knows how to chamber around she knows

how to do a MAG reload like she's

she's really good infatuated with it

yeah yeah yeah she smells it what what

is her fascination with guns what is

that I think it's the power and I think

it's just

well for one again she she looks to the

people that are survivors the ones that

are capable in this world and they have

the power to kill the questions she

asked Joel are often around what was it

like to kill what was it like to shoot

what was it like to do these things it's

almost like she's preparing herself and

again she doesn't want to be in a

situation where Joel's going to have to

save her she wants to hold her own and

she wants to demonstrate that she can

hold her own this is not a device or a

weapon of protection but it's

a weapon of attack it's something it's

an offensive weapon yeah she's not she's

not obsessed with a gun or owning a gun

because she's afraid for her life she

was obsessed with it because she wants

to walk the path of power the way

somebody like Joel does when she sees

Joel beating a man to death at the end

of our first episode

what she is experiencing inside of

herself along with a kind of inevitable

revulsion and fear and shock

is aspiration

because that's what she wants to be able

to do I mean this is a man that was

coming at them with a very big gun

and Joel defeats him with violence and

Ellie we don't yet understand

how she became infected we haven't heard

that full story but

I think it's probably safe to say that

it was violent

and perhaps

if she had had a gun if she had been

more prepared or had more of a position

of power she could have prevented it

from happening there's there's two cool

things that are kind of nods to the game

in this first there's the siphoning of

the gas which is something that in the

game bill as we're leaving him throws us

um a siphon and says you'd be surprised

at how many cars out there still have

gas and now we also have the pun book

no pun intended volume two but we'll

Livingston

volume two look you get it two like t-o

what did the mermaid where did her math

class

and ouchy bra like how cheap

I loved it I mean I remember in the game

being shocked that the game was suddenly

offering me this thing that had no

benefit for the game at all that's what

I loved about it that it was just

gratuitous

and yet lovely and human it was it was

sort of like saying hey you know what

you don't have to be eyes in the back of

your head or getting ready to run or

shoot at every moment you can take the

time to stop look around experience the

beauty of the world that's created but

what I also love about it and why it was

it was essential to include in the show

is that it undercuts this thing that

happens when adults write kids

they they either write them too young or

too old and there's this stage of life

uh my friend Scott Frank had the best

description of it ever I was talking to

him about my kids as they were going

through that age

and he said I call that time of life

[ __ ] you tuck me in they are ready to go

out on their own they want a gun they

want to be in charge they think they

know everything also they're still

children

and I love how Ellie has this joy for

something so Juvenile and infantile and

stupid and she knows it's stupid but she

loves it it's honest joy and I always

find myself connecting to characters

when they show me what they love

and Pedro's reaction is amazing but I

think one of the things that Neil and I

kind of as we were talking about

including it

it became a place where we thought you

know

given that it's not something that just

emerges dynamically and goes away when

you're pausing on the stick in the game

what can we do with this

joke book that comments on their

relationship as it changes man and

there's so much about it too because in

her backpack

she has a pun book and a weapon yes and

it's so funny [ __ ] you tuck me in it's

this cool opportunity that we show that

these things are getting mixed up yeah

you could see their relationship

or they're organically connecting with

each other whereas before it's like they

have to be very thoughtful and like try

like they've been trying and now they

don't they don't have to try anymore

it's just it's now it's happening this

is also the first moment where Joel

talks I mean obviously Joel is speaking

for the first three episodes but he

doesn't go on at length and they are

driving in the car

and she asks him about Tommy since

that's where he wants to go and he talks

for a really long time

and I just love that notion that Joel

doesn't even realize that it's happening

it just is happening it's happening

despite himself despite himself but also

after the prompt you know it's a long

story this is where I shut it down and

she goes is it longer than 25 hours yeah

we got what I thought was interesting

about this was a he's talking a lot

which in and of itself is interesting

B he is giving some context that creates

threads that we will be able to pull on

and expand on later and also at the very

end of it

when Ellie is pushing him and saying how

do you know you're going to find him uh

what if you don't and he says I will how

do you know I'm persistent and Ellie has

this little smile on her face because

she loves that that's what she aspires

to that's what she is that's what she is

it's persistence is the thing that that

connects the two of them the thing that

stuck out to me most when he's

discussing this whole thing about Tommy

and he kind of glosses over this he says

that

there have been people that I attached

to that I try to keep alive and I don't

do a good job of it that's one side of

the coin and the other side of the coin

is Joel has a certain narcissism that he

must go save Tommy there's almost a

resentment I gotta go save him again in

the first episode Tommy calls him from

jail

and he's like I gotta go bail him out

goddamn [ __ ] idiot there's this thing

of like I've got to go do my job and be

the guy but Joel loves being the guy

right and who am I if I'm not the guy

exactly exactly it's part of his

identity even as he's pretending to

complain about it this the way that in

our last episode bill says to Frankie or

my purpose this is Joel's purpose he has

to have somebody to save there is

another thing that he says to Ellie in

this conversation

he's talking about family

There's Hope for the world the world I

bothered going on

right

seeing the world so you don't know

you keep going for family

that's about it I'm not family no

your cargo

but I made a promise to Tess

and she was like family

he says it dispassionately hmm

but why why is wise because that's what

he wants to be true yeah

for whose benefit is he saying it for

himself or for her for his hmm it's I

mean what what is the alternative to say

you you are family I actually am

starting to care about you you're

filling a place in my heart that I

thought I had closed off completely and

by filling it in my heart you are

opening me up to experience the greatest

pain I've ever felt a pain I swear to

myself I would never feel again or he

can say yeah no you're not family you're

a job I was given you by Marlene I'm

delivering you and I'll drop you off

with the fireflies he's not gonna say

I've already murdered for you yeah

exactly um he's he and and I think

if he had said too much Ellie would have

been probably a bit shocked and put off

I like that that she takes it in stride

too this will happen again

in later episodes we are going to see

how she also is not quite ready to be

like you and me buddy it's us and he's

one

from people that knows like he's still

holding quite a bit of Secrets they're

both holding like secrets from each

other so as much as he's chatting he's

not chatting about everything he's not

talking about Sarah for example right

right and and there's a lot she's

omitting right which is you know that is

something that I think we talked a lot

about it in terms of adaptation Ellie

was a bit of an open book in the game

and we thought it was important for

Ellie to have a couple of secrets that

she was holding back that were a bit

darker and a bit creepier and a bit

scarier

where are we Kansas City

how far back do we have to go to get

around this

one glaring question for me would be

maybe it's me being a nerd and having

familiarity with the game but why Kansas

City Craig hates Pittsburgh with a

passion

I'm so sorry Joe manganello

um no I love Pittsburgh but really what

it came down to is

the pittsburghness of Pittsburgh wasn't

necessarily important

and we had certain environments we knew

we could shoot in because we were

shooting in Alberta largely around

Calgary a little bit in Edmonton

and it looked closer to Kansas City it

was just literally I think came down to

that it was just harder to manufacture

Pittsburgh in that place there's also

something

um we talked about

distances and where we want them to be

on the journey at a certain time of the

year right because where the story's

going and we wanted that moment to be

closer to the next beat which we won't

spoil

um or just like we're looking at the map

in Pittsburgh it was like oh that was

much further away so if this beat

happened here there'd be a lot more that

happens between the next beat so it's

just one of those things that

um I refer to as a superficial change

yeah because what city you're in is not

important what happened to the

characters and the choices they make in

that City that's what's really important

so to me the thing that I liked about it

being Kansas City is

it made it believable that they would

open up and they would talk to each

other right it made it believable that

they were more comfortable because what

we are going to get into with this is we

have this Ambush that happens which was

almost one for one if you've played the

game it was great help please help me

hey

please help

seat belt on are we gonna help him no

this attack happens from all these

people you we realize that we are what

we literally drove right into an ambush

and then we meet Brian right no no no no

it's okay it's okay it's over we're not

fighting anymore

I'm gonna go home I'll tell everyone

you're good

my mom isn't far if you can get me to

her

we can trade with you guys we could be

friends I didn't know I'm Brian I'm

Brian what's your name

humanize the enemy yeah where did this

come I mean I good god well in part I

think it was getting under the skin of

people that you think are just bad with

a capital B and it was also a chance to

ground violence because in the gaming

experience violence very quickly becomes

sort of just noise

you're killing a gazillion people lots

of monsters and here not so much and it

was important I think for us tonally to

make it clear that violence isn't clean

and the people that you hurt

are as human As You Are and Ellie who

had had this excited

thing with this gun and who had shown

violent impulses is really struck to her

core by what's happened here and Neil

has put his finger on the most important

thing

which is that Joel

is almost is angry

but why would he be angry at her he's

angry at her because he's angry at

himself

because he didn't hear that guy coming

because he was losing because he had

just given this big monologue about what

a savior he is and once again he would

have died without her Bingo it's

interesting both characters we had a lot

of conversations about what this moment

means and how what should their reaction

be and they should be comforting each

other they just survived this thing and

instead like Ellie is feeling like

fearful and shame like that she's she's

about to cry and I think it's it bothers

her more she's about to cry than what

this this Joel's about to do to this man

you know often in this genre like a

character like Ellie would symbolize the

Innocence that still exists in this

world and in this moment when the guy's

begging for his own life Ellie would be

arguing for that guy on that guy's

behalf like what if we left him alone

what if we what if we saved him and she

does none of that she understands what

needs to happen and she walks away and

lets it happen and her thought process

is I feel sad for him so I must be weak

right hmm right how did Joel how did he

kill Brian

he stabs him right in the chest

I was expecting to hear a gunshot and I

didn't and it was it was something that

I loved uh when I played the game for

the first time which was how scarce

ammunition was it made me scared also

it's loud why why draw attention to

yourself there's already been gunfire

why why throw one more bullet on there

someone's gonna come looking for this

kid another face that we get to meet

which was such a surprise

is Melanie lynskey yeah

this is Henry's work

understand

and he won't stop until we stop him

find who did this

find every collaborator

and Kill Them All

how did that come to be like this is a

this is a new character this is yes

we're completely infusing a new

character into our story where did this

come from the show affords us the

ability to leave John Ellie and flesh

out other characters in different ways

and the best thing I think you could do

in The Last of Us is flesh out your

antagonism to show that there's

motivation behind what they're doing

they don't see themselves as villains or

the bad guys we're just at odds with

each other because our goals somehow

overlap what we want which are different

things so to leave Joel Nelly and focus

on Kathleen and put a face to this

resistance that has taken over the

quarantine Zone from fedra

um made them more interesting and made

the the fact that like Joel and Ellie

and this other group are barreling

towards each other like you're kind of

cringing just wanting to avoid this

conflict between these two groups

Humanity

probably will not

in a post-apocalyptic world

descend into a Mad Max style we're just

80 people that love killing it's not

what happens right what happens instead

is we're 80 people who love each other

because we're family we're friends we're

neighbors

that love means we must protect

ourselves and our stuff and stay alive

at any cost which means anybody that

gets in that way of that needs to be uh

taken out and Joel himself right

was once one of those people that's how

he knows that the guy saying help me is

not really hurt it's

um they're they're being conned it's a

hustle it's a setup it's one of my

favorite lines from the game which is

when they're and I love that it happened

kind of in the same places how did you

know about that yeah this guy been on

both I've been on both sides and she

says

did you kill innocent people and he

gives her this look

the we it's we I can't describe it it's

guilty

it's confessional but it's almost like

please don't make me answer it to me is

you don't want to know me the answer

yeah you don't really want to know the

answer and don't make me please don't

make me say it and she understands in

that moment what the truth is so we have

this character Kathleen

who we understand is suffering when we

meet her

She's suffering even though she's the

one with the gun in her hand

I wonder if this is the cell

where my brother was beaten to death oh

you were wronged

and I'm sorry

this is gone too far

to stop

it has to stop now you mean

now that you're in the cell

but before people dying was okay

when you were safe and protected and

ratting on your neighbor's Defender they

put a gun to my head

have I satisfied the necessary

conditions for you to talk

she's aiming it at this man's face not

just any man her doctor who delivered

her the man who delivered her

so we have

a character who must be a little bit

like Madame defars from A Tale of Two

Cities like this revolutionary who

quietly becomes a terror

and who does horrible things in service

of that Revolution but also at the same

time is somebody that we can empathize

with and feel for because she has

suffered

now that's a tough thing to pull off

the name that we kind of landed on

pretty early was was Melanie and I've

been friends with Melanie for many years

but you know you can be friends with

people doesn't mean they're going to do

your thing so I sent her this so I was

like look I'm just going to describe

this character

but I I need you to know please if

there's even one percent of you it is

like I don't want to do it I'm okay with

it I don't I you know it's an awful

thing to think like we won't really be

very good friends anymore if you say no

so I gave her every possible out I could

give her

and and she agreed to do it it feels

like the character was created for her

there's there's something I understand

why she was put in charge she doesn't

look comfortable with a gun in her hand

until she shoots it right

um and then she has this Lieutenant uh a

familiar face well to you funny as

familiar face as a friend a familiar

voice but definitely not a familiar face

because my God he went all hour speaking

of course of Jeffrey Pierce Jeffrey

Pierce who voiced Tommy Joel's brother

in the game plays a very different

character in our show Jeffrey Pierce

plays Perry who is Kathleen's

revolutionary right-hand man there's

some tension between the two of them

because I felt from him you're not doing

a good job of leading us we need to tell

people that there's let me show you

something that's happening down here and

we see this the the pavement is

beginning to peel up there's something

happening we don't know what it is

something happening Underground

we tell the others

not yet

let's just handle what we have to handle

we can deal with this after after

seal off the building for now

okay

yeah when there's this hesitation from

Perry that's like that's the wrong move

I know it's the wrong move but I'll know

my place I'll stay in my Lane yeah he

did such I mean Jeffrey that's a tough

character to play and Jeffrey did a

brilliant job because he believes in her

he follows her

but he is also far more moral than she

is and she it's sort of this is the

thing sometimes the person who's leading

needs to be the person who has the least

reluctance that's why they lead you to

victory he's not as interested in her

pursuit of vengeance

which is a function of her love but

he'll follow her despite it he will

follow her despite it but he is

she's Bill and he's Frank and we can do

this all throughout the series

but there's also something interesting

with the two of them like like parents

that have certain knowledge and decide

when do we withhold information from our

kids right and when do we lie to them

and when do we tell them the truth right

which is also a theme that will keep

coming up in this show of like this idea

of trust and I know better than you and

right so this moment where she's like do

not tell them because they're not ready

to hear this right now I will decide

what they should know or not know as a

parent I want to know why does Perry

follow Kathleen no it's important you're

asking the question because it means you

are correctly confused cool or at least

you are correctly mystified it was

important for us for the audience to

wonder why why why is he following her

what is so compelling there

um all I can tell you is keep watching

the show typically you would not cast

Melanie in this role because she does

have like there's a sweetness to her yes

that makes this role that much more

interesting yes a maternal softness yeah

yeah because you you get the feeling

that this person's not designed to be

angry so if they are

what made them like that and what are

they capable of doing

they're out of food

Henry won't let Sam starve

double the guards around our Provisions

he's [ __ ] close I can feel it yeah

there's somebody out there named Henry

we don't know who he is right we know

that they're looking for him we know

that there's another that Henry has a

brother named Sam we don't know why

they're important we just know that

Kathleen is ready to throw the entire

revolutionary Army out there to find

them and bring them to some sort of

Justice

while Joel and Ellie are hiding from all

those trucks they have a moment where

Ellie asks him if he's doing okay are

you okay

I'm all right

are you all right yeah

and that rattles him because that is a

complete violation of who he feels he

needs to be which is the guy that nobody

needs to worry if he's okay I think he

says I didn't hear that guy coming

he realizes oh my God this child just

basically killed somebody for the first

time and all I've been doing is being

grouchy

and he tries to comfort her he's not

good at it he admits that the best he

can he does the best he can

and then she tells him that wasn't my

first time

yes and so we are left wondering

what was the first time but

what's interesting is Joel at this

moment decides I'm not going to push

that instead I'm going to reward her

with the gun

because I trust now I am going to show

her that I trust and he gives her the

gun and this is the most father-daughter

moment they've had

finger off the trigger

now who taught you that said your school

figures

thumb

over your thumb

left hand

squeezes down on the right

got it

there you go

look at

it and then he wiggles it to show her

that she can't get loose and they laugh

which is a laugh that every parent who's

taught a kid has seen this laugh of

Discovery and joy like I've learned

even though Joel doesn't get it we know

there's no coming back

once he gives her that gun and he shows

her how to use it he is

uh on a permanent path

towards returning to fatherhood I think

Joel

he's giving in

like the world is reminding him again

and again you will fail you cannot do

this by yourself and this is the first

time where he's giving in to that

we're now more on equal footing than we

were before and I have to trust you on

this journey alongside me and bad parent

or good parent

parent and the look on her face I mean

she's crying she's trying to not cry

she's failing and then he gives her this

gun and she's immediately smiling

not because she loves guns so much

although we know she does but because

she's never had she's never known right

a parent she even questions if Marlene's

her I mean it was pretty funny that's

great do I look like your mom what am I

uh he also somewhere deep down even if

he doesn't have access to it in that

moment and seeing her face light up is

an experience he would have never had

with Sarah ever hmm because this is not

Sarah this is a very different person

and this is one of those places where

you realize that sometimes the people

that you create biologically

are not

as similar to you as other people you

may meet

on your path in life well Ellie she's

telling him I've already killed someone

right

she's already lived like a like a vastly

different life than his daughter would

ever know I've experienced this I'm sure

other people have as well where there's

a sometimes the grief and the sadness is

all that you have that remains of the

person that you are grieving or sad over

and when there is an opportunity to love

again or there's an opportunity an

invitation to feel

Joy connection hope something

there is this fear that you're swinging

from one Vine to the next he doesn't

realize it

but it's beginning to happen

and and that's why

I loved using the joke book at the

beginning of this episode

because it feels like nothing it feels

just like this frivolous bit of

goofiness

and when we get to the end and they've

created their little safe nest and she

delivers one final joke and he laughs

laughs Joe hmm

did you know diarrhea is hereditary

what

yeah

it runs in your jeans

you're losing a big time

we haven't seen Joel even smile since

the world ended much less laugh and he

can't contain it it just comes out he

doesn't even know he doesn't even get it

people make characters too smart and

Pedro gets so annoyed at me because I

would always say like you know Joel's

not that smart and he would be like can

you please stop saying that I'm like

well you know but Joel is not the most

insightful man in the world let's face

it yeah when it finally does hit him

it's going to hit him with an almost

nuclear force interestingly I I and

again this is all an open interpretation

that's what I love about again this this

adaptation and how nuanced and subtle

these things are but

I believe Ellie knows Ellie sees it

Ellie sees the change in him already in

a way that he doesn't yeah I think

that's right I buy that I think that's

right because she is insightful yeah and

she is in many ways smarter than him

she's never had a parent never had a dad

and it's fulfilling her

yeah it's it's awesome

she loves it and it's immediately

interrupted

Ellie waking up Joel I love that he fell

asleep again on his right ear but he

woke up on his left meaning that the

right ear that he can't hear well out of

he can't he didn't hear someone stepping

on the glass and we wake up and we have

these two new characters

that are facing us and we're staring at

them down the barrel of a gun yep we

don't know who it is if you haven't

played the game but we have been hearing

the names Henry and Sam floated about

and I think that we might have just met

Henry and Sam

just a decent chance

I don't want to give away too much but

it does seem likely uh also the casting

announcements that were in variety and

so forth would indicate people those

guys were Henry and Sam uh something

that that is unique to this is normally

if I've any adaptation whether it be a

book or whether it be a play whether it

be a game I'm like ah got it now I know

where they're going with this the

problem is you guys are bastards and you

have completely taught me to not good

yeah my expectation is like I don't know

what's going to happen you don't and and

that's important we because we know the

game so well and because we know that

story so well there was also a little

bit of engineering to say look we don't

want this to feel like an inevitable

sort of slog for people that know the

story of the game we want them to be as

on the edge of their seat as possible

and that means surprising them

repeatedly and we do and we will

continue to if you've played the game a

hundred times I can assure you you're

going to be startled a lot between now

and the end of this series

well thank you Craig for joining us my

Here’s every reference, nuance, and layer from the podcast transcript regarding the phrase and concept of “fuck you, tuck me in”, as described by Craig Mazin when discussing The Last of Us Episode 4:

1. Origin and Explanation of the Phrase

Craig Mazin attributes the phrase to screenwriter Scott Frank, who used it to describe a specific stage of adolescent development—particularly kids in that liminal stage between childhood and independence.

Quote from Mazin:

“They either write them too young or too old and there’s this stage of life... Scott Frank had the best description... He said I call that time of life ‘fuck you, tuck me in.’”

This phrase perfectly encapsulates the contradiction inherent in adolescence—especially in older children and early teenagers. It captures:

The rebellious independence of a child who wants control, autonomy, and to make their own choices.

The underlying emotional vulnerability and continued need for nurturing, protection, and reassurance from a parent or guardian figure.

2. How It Applies to Ellie

Ellie, as a character, embodies this concept thoroughly in Episode 4.

She’s tough, sarcastic, curious about violence, obsessed with weapons, and trying to assert herself as competent and dangerous—like Joel.

But she also:

Loves silly jokes (via her pun book).

Seeks comfort, affirmation, and attention from Joel.

Reacts to trauma in ways that expose her deep emotional need to be cared for.

Examples of “fuck you, tuck me in” behavior in Ellie:

She wants a gun, wants to use it, and isn’t squeamish about violence—but is quietly haunted after using it.

She cracks dumb puns with total joy, knowing they're "stupid," showing her youth and need for joy and silliness.

She pretends to be okay after a violent encounter but reveals that it “wasn’t her first time,” hinting at deep past trauma she hasn’t processed.

3. Symbolic Mixing: The Pun Book and the Gun

Mazin and Druckmann specifically point out how Ellie carries both:

A pun book (a symbol of innocence, humor, childhood).

A gun (a symbol of violence, agency, and adulthood).

This juxtaposition visually and symbolically represents “fuck you, tuck me in”—a child becoming an adult but still craving childlike comforts.

“In her backpack she has a pun book and a weapon… it’s this cool opportunity that we show that these things are getting mixed up.”

4. Impact on Joel’s Character Arc

Joel, meanwhile, begins to step into a father figure role, which he's resistant to because of past trauma (his daughter Sarah’s death). Ellie’s “fuck you, tuck me in” energy is both a challenge and an invitation to him:

She demands respect and autonomy.

But she also, implicitly and subtly, wants his affection, attention, and protection.

When Joel teaches her how to hold a gun properly—and they laugh together—it’s one of the clearest moments where the “parental” bond slips into place.

“That’s the most father-daughter moment they’ve had.”

5. Broader Commentary on Writing Adolescents

The podcast criticizes how adult writers often fail at capturing adolescence:

Too young: Making teens overly innocent, naive, or cutesy.

Too old: Making them wise beyond their years, hardened like adults, or lacking emotional honesty.

“Fuck you, tuck me in” is offered as the golden middle—an authentic, emotionally grounded depiction of the inner contradictions in teenage characters.

Summary: “Fuck You, Tuck Me In” as a Writing Principle

The phrase is a philosophical and structural approach to writing adolescent characters. It implies:

They’re not just small adults or big babies.

They’re in transition, confused, inconsistent, and emotionally intense.

They might reject you while needing you deeply.

Their actions may scream independence, but their hearts often whisper “please take care of me.”

For Ellie (and characters like her), this approach results in a rich, layered portrayal that resonates with audiences because it mirrors real adolescence.

User:


This is great, now I want you to apply the relationship between the “fuck you, tuck me in” concept to each section of your search findings, starting with “Early Childhood (1-5 Years)”.

Use the following writing sample to determine tone, depth, and form (but not content — that is irrelevant to this exercise) to present your writing within:

Eliciting Taste
Taste is one of the most elusive senses to translate onscreen. Unlike sight or sound, it cannot be directly presented to the audience—only implied. Yet when rendered effectively, it can evoke visceral responses, summon memory, and deepen a character’s relationship with their world. The key lies not in replication, but in suggestion: allowing the viewer’s own sensory imagination to fill in the gaps. The experience of taste begins with the body. The way a character interacts with food—whether they hesitate before a bite, devour something ravenously, or wince as they chew—offers immediate insight into the gustatory world. These physical reactions, often involuntary, bypass the need for explanation and speak directly to sensation. A moment as simple as lip-smacking or a grimace can suggest flavor with startling clarity. Sound becomes a powerful conduit for taste. The crunch of a crisp apple, the slurp of noodles, the sizzle of meat hitting a hot pan—these sonic cues activate the imagination. In the absence of literal flavor, texture becomes a stand-in. When sound design emphasizes how something feels in the mouth, it invites the audience to imagine how it tastes. Visuals serve as emotional and sensory triggers. A slow close-up of glistening syrup being poured or a knife slicing cleanly through a ripe fruit can stir memory as much as appetite. Just as importantly, how food is prepared or handled tells a story. A character meticulously seasoning a dish communicates care, tradition, or control; one discarding a full plate might reveal aversion, grief, or detachment. Food becomes a mirror, reflecting emotional states through action and form. But taste is never just about taste. It is tied to longing, to memory, to need. When a character responds to a flavor—whether in delight, disgust, or nostalgia—it is often not the food itself that matters, but what it represents. The most resonant sensory moments don’t merely ask, “What does this taste like?” They ask, “What does this taste mean?”
Taste in Screenwriting
In a screenplay, taste cannot be described the way it might be in prose. You cannot rely on language to tell the audience what something tastes like—you must instead design a moment that allows the audience to imagine it. This is the unique challenge and opportunity of screenwriting: to convey an internal, invisible sensation through action, image, and rhythm. The key is to think behaviorally. Rather than stating that a dish is bitter or delicious, show how a character responds to it. Does their face contort after the first bite? Do they pause, close their eyes, and allow the flavor to linger? Do they shovel food in with an urgency that suggests hunger—or emotional desperation? These moments become expressive beats, not just of taste, but of character. In screenwriting terms, this means writing not what the food is, but how it lands in the body. Sound is another dimension that can be established on the page. While you may not control how every auditory cue is realized in production, including details like crunches, sizzles, slurps, or the faint pop of a cork allows the reader—and eventually the audience—to experience taste through texture. These sounds should be purposeful, not ornamental. A quiet scene broken only by the loud chewing of a character can be comical, intimate, or unsettling, depending on context and intent. Visual suggestion is equally important. Screenwriting favors economy, but specificity in visual detail is what allows taste to emerge. A slice of lemon, juice spraying as the knife cuts through it. A pan of bacon curling at the edges, fat spitting onto the stovetop. A cake half-eaten, left on the counter, its frosting melting in the sun. These aren’t just props—they are narrative clues. You’re not just writing food; you’re writing how the food speaks. In longer formats like features, taste can serve as a motif. A character who refuses to eat early in the story, then cooks for someone else in the final act—that’s not about flavor, it’s about change. The act of preparing, tasting, or even rejecting food becomes a way to externalize internal shifts. This is where taste moves beyond a sensory detail and becomes story architecture. Ultimately, writing taste into a screenplay isn’t about mimicking the sense itself—it’s about trusting the form. Film is not an explanatory medium; it’s an experiential one. When you craft a moment that engages the body, you invite the audience into it. They don’t need to be told what it tastes like. They’ll know—because the scene gave them just enough to remember it for themselves.

Absolutely. Let’s begin with the first section: Early Childhood (1–5 Years), and explore how the “fuck you, tuck me in” concept resonates within it—subtly, even before the phrase becomes fully realized.

Early Childhood (1–5 Years): The Embers Before Rebellion

In the earliest years of life, the “fuck you, tuck me in” dynamic does not yet burn—but its embers are present, glowing beneath layers of dependency and instinctual need. This is the stage before the contradiction becomes conscious. The child is, in essence, a bundle of desires they cannot fully articulate: to assert, to connect, to control, to be cared for. The drive for autonomy is nascent, expressed through defiance, tantrums, and curiosity—but it is always tethered to the need for closeness. The phrase, at this age, is not spoken—but it is felt.

A child demanding independence while gripping a parent’s hand. A toddler saying “No!” while simultaneously climbing into a lap. These are behavioral paradoxes, not psychological declarations. And yet, they are the foundation of the adolescent contradiction that phrase encapsulates so well. Even before a child has the language for rebellion, they perform it—in flashes of stubbornness, selective listening, boundary-pushing. But always, always, they circle back. To be held. To be fed. To be tucked in.

Cognitive Development and the Paradox of Power

Early childhood is defined by literal thought. Power is not symbolic—it is who can reach the counter, who controls the iPad, who gives the snack. To a three-year-old, resistance is tangible: saying “no” is an act of power. But when the lights dim and the house grows quiet, power evaporates. The same child who challenged every instruction all day will now beg for one more story, one more kiss. The contradiction is not hypocrisy—it is truth. They want both things: to push away and be pulled close.

This is the earliest iteration of the tension between autonomy and attachment—not yet defined by identity, but by need.

Language and Rebellion as Play

As children begin to speak, they begin to manipulate language. Not just to name the world, but to resist it. A toddler’s “mine” is not just a claim—it is a boundary. Their “no” is an instrument. They are learning that language can provoke, delay, command. These are early experiments in selfhood. When a four-year-old throws a toy and says “I hate you,” it is not cruelty. It is an attempt to express emotion larger than they can bear—fear, frustration, overstimulation. And moments later, they’ll cry when you walk out of the room. The tug-of-war is already underway.

The Joy of the Infantile and the Need to Be Seen

In The Last of Us, Ellie’s love for stupid puns—“so Juvenile and infantile and stupid”—is described as honest joy. That same joy lives in early childhood, unguarded. Children this age laugh before they understand irony. They love nonsense for its own sake. But even as they delight in the silly, they are watching you. Did you see me laugh? Did you hear my joke? Are you paying attention? These questions are not asked aloud, but they live under every giggle.

To tuck in a child is not just a ritual of sleep—it is a ritual of being noticed.

Writing the “Pre-Verbal Contradiction”

To write early childhood through the lens of “fuck you, tuck me in” is to understand that the contradiction is physical, not philosophical. It’s a toddler who hits you and then sobs in your arms. It’s a child who throws off the blanket, only to cry out for it seconds later. These are not mood swings. They are expressions of an internal world where power and vulnerability are inextricably linked.

In fiction, this age is often flattened into cuteness or chaos. But the emotional truth of early childhood is more complex. When portrayed with honesty, children this age can carry the seeds of the same thematic weight we see in teenagers: the push and pull of identity, the longing to be free while also fearing separation.

The “fuck you” is whispered in their resistance.
The “tuck me in” is screamed in their sobs.

Both are true.

Of course. Here's a revised version of the Early Childhood (1–5 Years) section, stripped of character-specific examples or references. This version focuses purely on ideas and concepts, aligning with the tone, depth, and form of your provided sample.

Early Childhood (1–5 Years): The Preverbal Paradox

In early childhood, the foundational contradiction that later defines adolescent resistance is already present in embryonic form. It does not yet manifest in language or ideology, but in behavior—pure, immediate, and unfiltered. This is a stage of absolute dependence, marked by a simultaneous and instinctive desire for agency. Autonomy is not yet a goal but an instinctual impulse, expressed not through thought but through action.

The self is still forming, and with it, the awareness of boundaries. A child at this stage lives in tension between the comfort of total care and the primal urge to assert presence. These opposing needs—security and sovereignty—coexist without harmony. They surface as contradiction, not because the child is confused, but because both needs are equally true. The emotional logic of early childhood is nonlinear. One does not cancel the other.

Power Without Perspective

Control, in this phase, is perceived rather than understood. The desire to affect outcomes, make choices, and direct experience exists in full force, though without the context of consequence. When the child resists, it is not ideological. It is elemental. This desire to act upon the world precedes the ability to understand it.

The assertion of will is pure expression—not defiance, not rebellion, not protest. Simply the emergence of self.

Language as Emergent Autonomy

As language develops, it becomes a tool not just for description, but for distinction. The first words a child uses to navigate conflict—to deny, to demand, to declare—are more than functional. They mark the earliest experiments in self-definition. Every refusal, every repetition, every misused phrase is a stake in the ground: I exist apart from you.

These are not yet declarations of independence. They are declarations of presence.

Need Without Ambivalence

What defines this stage is not the absence of need, but the clarity of it. Dependency is total, unguarded, unhidden. But it is not submissive. The child will reach for comfort even as they resist direction. They will cling to protection even as they test its limits. This is not contradiction—it is coexistence. Emotional proximity and boundary-testing arise from the same source.

There is no shame yet in needing care. The desire for autonomy has not yet learned to conceal its vulnerabilities.

Writing the Tension of Becoming

To write this stage truthfully is to understand that its contradictions are not conscious. They are physical, rhythmic, and affective. Behavior precedes belief. The push and pull between resistance and reliance is not narrative—it is experiential.

This is not the rebellion of independence, but the rehearsal for it. The early choreography of distance and closeness. The body pulling away before the mind knows why. The voice asserting itself before the self is defined.

The emotional architecture of this stage is simple, but not simplistic. It is not about complexity of thought, but intensity of feeling. In this sense, it holds the blueprint for what will later become the emotional paradox of adolescence.

The contradiction does not need to be named.

It only needs to be felt.

Absolutely. Here's a refined version of Early Childhood (1–5 Years) that adheres more closely to the tone, depth, and form of your provided writing sample—measured, sensory-aware, and conceptually rich, without reliance on character specifics.

Early Childhood (1–5 Years)

The contradiction that will one day be spoken aloud—resist me, but stay with me—first emerges in early childhood not as thought, but as impulse. It is not yet a phrase or even a pattern, but a tension carried in the body: the instinct to pull away from what one cannot yet live without. In this stage, autonomy begins not as ideology, but as gesture. A turned head. A clenched fist. A word repeated not for clarity but for control.

The child at this age does not articulate the desire for independence. They enact it. The rejection of assistance, the demand for sameness, the testing of limits—these are not rebellions in the adult sense. They are rituals of becoming. The need to separate is developmental, not personal. It arrives before language can capture it, before the child understands what is being separated from.

And yet, dependency is absolute. The one who is pushed away is also the one expected to return. The demand for space is inseparable from the expectation of safety. Here, the contradiction is not hypocrisy—it is structure. The child does not yet resolve the conflict between distance and closeness because there is no resolution. There is only alternation. A rhythm of assertion and retreat.

The beginnings of language deepen this rhythm. The word “no” becomes not just a negation but a tool—a first experiment in boundary-making. Speech becomes the earliest form of personal architecture, building the outlines of a self not yet fully inhabited. But the same mouth that denies still calls out in the dark. The same voice that resists also invites comfort, guidance, containment.

What appears as volatility is, in truth, clarity. This is a stage without pretense, where need has not yet learned to hide itself. The desire to be held is not softened by embarrassment. The longing for attention is not masked by irony. The child lives in pure affect, without the armor of performance. In this way, early childhood is perhaps the most honest expression of the tension that adolescence will later complicate.

To write this stage is to render contradiction without commentary. Autonomy is not yet an idea; it is an instinct. And that instinct does not come cleanly. It tangles with need. It refuses explanation. It does not ask to be understood—only responded to.

There is no strategy in this behavior. Only sensation. Only want.

Thank you—and here is Middle Childhood (6–12 Years), written in full alignment with your reference sample’s tone, depth, and form: precise, conceptual, and embodied. This section honors the cognitive and emotional expansion of this stage, while continuing to explore the thematic architecture of “fuck you, tuck me in” as a developmental undercurrent.

Middle Childhood (6–12 Years)

By middle childhood, the contradiction has learned to speak. It now holds shape in language, in gesture, in posture. The child begins to understand themselves as distinct—not only physically, but internally. Preferences sharpen. Hierarchies form. The self is no longer a fluid, reactive presence but a structure under construction. And with it comes the dawning awareness that this self can be performed, protected, withheld.

Here, the need for autonomy is no longer only impulse—it is concept. The child begins to weigh options, compare choices, and test consequences. But this new cognitive clarity does not displace dependency. Instead, it reconfigures it. The desire for closeness remains, but now it arrives through side doors: shared activities, indirect questions, proximity without confession. Love becomes something one signals rather than states.

The contradiction is not louder—it is subtler. The same child who seeks privacy now leaves the door ajar. The one who pushes back against rules still checks for approval. Affection may be rejected in public, then demanded in private. The body that once sought the lap now seeks the hallway, the closed room—but still listens for footsteps outside.

This is the age where loyalty shifts. Belonging moves outward—from family to peers, from the known to the comparative. The child begins to look across rather than up, and the approval they seek is no longer singular. They want to belong, but on their own terms. To be chosen, but not corrected. To be seen, but not scrutinized.

In this way, middle childhood becomes the first rehearsal of identity through social architecture. Group dynamics, imitation, competition—these become mirrors. The self is tested in others. And in the testing, vulnerability is both heightened and hidden. Emotional exposure feels riskier now, because the child can imagine what it might cost. The emotional logic becomes more strategic, more layered.

Yet beneath it, the need remains unchanged. The desire to be anchored is no less urgent. It simply disguises itself better.

To write this stage is to hold opposing truths in balance. The child is more articulate, more discerning, more performative—but not yet self-sufficient. Their emotional needs remain immense, though increasingly camouflaged. This is where affection might be expressed through sarcasm, where anger is a mask for fear, where a request for independence contains a hope that someone will still say no.

The contradiction has matured—but it has not resolved.

They may not ask to be tucked in anymore.

But they notice if no one offers.

Yes.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Here is Adolescence (13–17 Years), continuing in the exact tone, depth, and form you requested—measured, textured, idea-driven, and emotionally resonant. This stage is where “fuck you, tuck me in” stops being subtext and becomes emotional architecture: spoken, denied, enacted, and clung to all at once.

Adolescence (13–17 Years)

By adolescence, the contradiction no longer lives beneath the surface. It becomes conscious, vocal, and charged. What was once instinct in early childhood and strategy in middle childhood now arrives as stance—a chosen, cultivated posture that insists on distance even as it aches for closeness. The adolescent is no longer unaware of their dependence. They are aware of it and resentful of it. They seek separation not because they do not need others, but because they do.

Autonomy becomes a defining project. Not just physical or logistical autonomy, but emotional, intellectual, ideological. The adolescent does not want to be told what to think, what to feel, or who to become. They seek authorship of the self. And yet, in the same breath, they seek affirmation. The drive to individuate is paired with a plea to be seen. To be understood not as a child—but as this person, specifically, newly, precariously formed.

The contradiction is now not only behavioral—it is philosophical. The adolescent wants freedom, but resents its cost. They demand privacy, but hope someone will still knock. They dismiss care, but measure its absence. They reject control, but look for containment. They long for unconditional acceptance while also daring those closest to withstand their rejection. This is the paradox at full volume: keep out, but don’t leave.

Emotionally, this stage is characterized by sharp contrasts. Elation and despair live side by side, often within the same hour. Identity is a revolving door—tried on, discarded, reclaimed. Every interaction feels freighted with potential meaning. Affection is dangerous. Vulnerability is weaponized. The adolescent learns not just to feel, but to perform their feelings. Sometimes ironically. Sometimes defiantly. Sometimes just to see if anyone is still watching.

In this stage, “tuck me in” may look like confrontation. It may arrive in the form of provocation, argument, silence. Emotional needs become encoded—buried beneath sarcasm, anger, or distance. The more they need connection, the more they may act in ways that sabotage it. This is not manipulation. It is a defense. If care is rejected first, it cannot be withheld.

To write this stage is to lean into the ambiguity. The adolescent is not a contradiction to be resolved, but an emotional system under pressure. Belonging and rejection, maturity and regression, strength and softness—all compete for expression. No moment is simple. Every interaction has weight, implication, danger. And yet, there is beauty in it: in the rawness, in the immediacy, in the staggering clarity of feeling.

The phrase “fuck you, tuck me in” is no longer a metaphor. It is an emotional position. A survival strategy. A declaration and a plea.

And the characters who live in it are not confused.

They’re just asking, without saying it: Will you stay, even now?

ChatGPT:


Excellent. Below is the “Crafting Authentic Child and Adolescent Characters” section, rewritten through the conceptual lens of “fuck you, tuck me in”. The form, rhythm, and conceptual layering remain aligned with your original writing sample—focused not on technique as instruction, but as insight.

Crafting Authentic Child and Adolescent Characters

To write young characters with emotional truth is to write contradiction without apology. The child does not progress toward adulthood in a straight line. They lurch, regress, leap forward, collapse. They test their boundaries not because they want to escape them, but to make sure they still exist. The adolescent does not abandon childhood so much as drag it behind them—mocked, resented, needed.

The most honest portraits of young characters do not ask, Who are they?
They ask, What are they pushing against? And, What do they hope will remain?

Let Complexity Precede Coherence

Children and adolescents are rarely consistent. They are often in transition—emotional, cognitive, hormonal, social—sometimes all at once. To insist on clean character arcs at this stage is to misunderstand what the arc is. The movement isn’t toward resolution. It’s toward integration. What looks like contradiction is often growth in process. The writer’s task is not to smooth the edges, but to keep them sharp.

The character who lashes out may be calling for safety.
The one who demands space may be begging to be noticed.
They can want freedom and fear abandonment in the same breath.

Write both. Hold both.

Build Want and Resistance into the Same Gesture

At these ages, desire is rarely straightforward. Want is often disguised, even from the character themselves. A child may act out not to disobey, but to be corrected. An adolescent may provoke in order to test whether love still stands. To understand this is to recognize that emotion and performance are often braided together. The face they show is not always the feeling they carry.

To write a character truthfully at this age is to resist clean motives. Instead, write moments that contain two opposing truths: I hate this, and I hope you notice. I don’t care, and I desperately do.

The contradiction is not a flaw in the character.

It is the shape of who they are becoming.

Don’t Separate Softness from Strength

There is a tendency to divide young characters into types: the sensitive child or the hardened survivor. But the truth is, these traits often coexist. A young person can crave violence and still fear loneliness. They can be quick with a joke and still carry sorrow. They can want control and ache for comfort. The push toward independence does not cancel the need for care—it intensifies it.

The strongest adolescent may still need to be tucked in.
The bravest child may still sleep with a light on.
Honor both.

Let Affection Be Earned, But Not Absent

The emotional heart of a young character is often revealed not through confession, but through connection. It is not always about what they say—but how they try, however awkwardly, to reach out. These gestures—small, offhand, accidental—become the places where affection resides. A character may never say “I need you,” but they might hover in a doorway, ask an unnecessary question, leave something behind just to return for it.

The emotional weight lives in what they cannot admit.

Let them want love without knowing how to ask for it.

Let them test whether it will come anyway.

Write the Emotional Terrain, Not the Labels

Young characters are not ideas. They are not shorthand for innocence or rebellion or trauma. They are experiences. To write them is to evoke not only what they think, but what it feels like to be them. The friction under the skin. The unsaid thing in the room. The need that emerges only in the dark.

The phrase “fuck you, tuck me in” is not dialogue.
It is emotional architecture.

Write from that architecture. Build every scene so that defiance and longing can occupy the same space.

And if the character walks away?

Let them glance back.

Thank you for the clarity. Below is a revised version of the Crafting Authentic Child and Adolescent Characters section, now fully aligned with the form, tone, and depth of your writing sample. The structure is observational, idea-driven, and grounded in behavior and contradiction, rather than directive or analytic.

Crafting Authentic Child and Adolescent Characters

The experience of becoming is rarely clean. For children and adolescents, identity does not arrive—it accumulates. It gathers through friction, failure, resistance, and need. The contradiction at the heart of this process—the desire to separate and the longing to belong—is not a phase to outgrow. It is the shape of growing. The most resonant young characters are built not from traits, but from this internal tension. They are not consistent. They are real.

Character emerges in the gap between what is said and what is meant. When a child withdraws, they may be waiting to be followed. When a teenager mocks affection, they may be testing whether it will be offered anyway. This is not duplicity—it is defense. It is the emotional logic of someone who has not yet learned how to carry their need without shame.

Behavior is the signal. A slammed door, a joke at the wrong time, a refusal to answer—these are not obstacles to intimacy. They are bids for it. The question is not whether the character knows what they want, but whether they believe it’s safe to ask.

Contradiction becomes the character’s native language. Softness coexists with spite. Wonder with boredom. The longing to be understood flickers beneath the performance of indifference. It is not that they don’t care. It is that they care constantly and without certainty. They test, not to win, but to be held in the aftermath of losing.

Dialogue becomes a mask. The words are louder than the need they carry. A simple statement—I don’t care—can be lined with hope, with dread, with invitation. The voice that speaks may be trying to drown out the one that doesn’t know how to ask.

In this emotional landscape, defiance is rarely the point. It is proximity that matters. Who is watching. Who stays after the outburst. Who offers something small, without being asked.

Characters at this age do not seek resolution. They seek containment. To be held without being softened. To be understood without being explained. The phrase “fuck you, tuck me in” is not a contradiction to be reconciled. It is a condition to be honored.

What they push against reveals what they need. What they refuse often names what they long for.

And what they love—quietly, fiercely, without permission—tells us everything they cannot say.

The most frequent missteps in writing young characters stem not from misunderstanding them, but from oversimplifying them. When contradiction is flattened into consistency, when complexity is treated as confusion, what remains is an outline of youth—not its experience.

One common error is reducing emotional volatility to randomness. But these shifts—sudden, sharp, and often ill-timed—are not arbitrary. They are responsive. They reflect a character’s shifting proximity to vulnerability, to attention, to care. The anger that appears unprovoked may be a defense against absence. The silence that follows may be grief in disguise. There is a pattern, even if it does not resolve.

Another is the temptation to grant wisdom too early. The precocious child, the hyper-articulate teen—these are not untrue, but when insight replaces struggle, something is lost. Emotional understanding at this age is rarely clean. It is jagged. It is partial. A young character might name a feeling accurately and still be overwhelmed by it. Clarity does not equal ease.

Flattening a child into sweetness—or hardening them into survival—strips away the layers in between. The most affecting characters are rarely innocent or tough. They are tender in one scene and brutal in the next. They joke, they test, they retreat. They want to be loved. They do not always know how to accept it.

Overstatement is another risk. Childhood and adolescence do not need embellishment. The stakes are already enormous. A missed glance can carry the weight of betrayal. A kindness left unreturned can linger for days. What’s unsaid often lands harder than what is. Emotion, here, does not need to be heightened. It only needs to be true.

Perhaps the most subtle failure is writing from the outside in—crafting a character as they are perceived, rather than how they feel. To write youth authentically is not to remember what it was like, but to re-enter it. Not as observer, but as participant. The child does not know they are growing. The adolescent does not think of themselves as in transition. They are simply in it—living forward, moment to moment, unsure of where they began.

When that immediacy is replaced with commentary, something essential disappears. The character becomes someone to describe, rather than someone to feel through.

The danger is not in contradiction.

The danger is in coherence.
