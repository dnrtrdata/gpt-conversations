Adapt the info in the following transcript to turning a short story into a feature-length screenplay:

Hey guys, I'm Anna,
and today I'm really excited to share with you some of the great ways that you can turn
your story into a script. Now, writing a script can help you
tell a great story, and organize and communicate your ideas in a way that makes production manageable. There are some questions, about like, whether or not you need a script for YouTube shows, or if it's ok to just
make a video by ad-libbing. And that answer is just really dependent on
the kind of show that you are making. But I am a strong advocate
for having a set script, and then taking that on set
and having fun with it. And just using it as a guideline. So today I'm gonna talk about
the benefits of having that script, and how it'll make your life
a lot easier on set. A lot of people are afraid
to even get started. It's like this paralyzing fear of, like I've never written a script before,
I've never done a video before. And I think that starting,
is really just the hardest part. So the best way to actually
get started writing is to set aside a specific time
that you're gonna commit and make it a routine. That will help you so much. If you find yourself having writers' block, what you can do is just take
a tiny piece of your story, and elaborate on that. If you're writing a script, write out just one scene
that you know from that script. Or even just one piece of dialogue. Feel free to totally indulge yourself in a scene
for like 40 pages, that goes nowhere. Because the more that you sort of drown and waddle around in it, the clearer and clearer
that story will become. So, two years ago,
I wrote a 200,000-word novel, called "Schizophrenic Lesbian in Space". That was total garbage, just didn't
make any sense at all. Everyone in it was a psychopath. But I kept working on it and kept reworking it
and reworking it, and that eventually became Miss Earth,
which is a 12 minute short film, that actually made sense and had
some semblance of a story. So even if you find yourself
writing total nonsense, just keep going with it, because you'll
start to walk around in that world, and really be able to find the story
and the protagonist that you're looking for. Most stories are generally
comprised of three acts, although it can depend on the kind of story
you are telling. An act breaks up your story
into three pivotal parts. Usually the first act is the setup,
the second act the confrontation, and the third act is the resolution. Something about it speaks to us in a way
that leaves us feeling satisfied when it is done right. There are many ways to turn your ideas into script and to share your message with people. You can simply write the pros, describing
step by step how the story will evolve, or you can adopt the industry standard and
write the location of the action, the action itself, and, of course
the dialogue. But keep in mind, write only
what you can show on camera. So try not to write out the inner, deepest
thoughts of the characters, unless you present that in voice over dialogue, and consider referencing emotions only,
if you're describing how a character looks when they react to another character
or situation. This is what makes screenwriting
extremely challenging and fun. Tension! You need it!
And here is why. I wanna be sitting on the edge of my seat,
especially today, when everyone has a million things going on,
we have our phones, we have our laptops, and everything. Why should we pay attention
to what we are watching? You need to be able to captivate people,
right off the bat. And you do that with tension. It's a unique thing, but it's creating a conflict
with a character I actually care about, and putting them in some kind of
dilemma or peril that seems immediate. And I think the best way to do this,
is with stakes that are really high, like life or death or some kind of
ginormous failure. Conflict to me in a story, is when a person either has to overcome something external, or something internal,
to be able to move forward. Whether that makes them a better person, or
a worse person, a la Breaking Bad, We want to see that evolution of a character
on screen. I think the best stories are when a character
overcomes something, both externally and internally, and both of those conflicts
are interweaved. When I shoot a short film, a script
is absolutely necessary. I did one called "Afflicted Incorporated",
where it was all of these girls in crazy make-up, sort of
personifying diseases. So I was anorexia, my friend was bi-polar
disease, someone was body dysmorphic disorder. If I did not have a script, then we would
not have made our day, because six hours of the day had to be
devoted into make-up. And so one by one the girls would be
coming out of make-up and we would have to shoot their coverage. If I didn't have a script I would have no idea
what lines they would say, where they are when they are saying those lines, or even what their emotional stakes are in that moment. It is absolutely essential that everyone
on your crew has access to it, so they can give you input and ideas on
how to shoot a certain scene. Especially if your expertise isn't in like
camera department or lighting, so then people can put in their ideas and really hone in on the tone that you were going for in your writing. A script allows you and your producers to control
the scope and budget of what you are creating. So you're not kind of writing things that you
can't realistically afford to shoot. And finally, having a script helps you plan your schedule. It is 1,000 times easier to plan your day, when you actually know what it is you're shooting. I drink the script koolaid. I think that
they are absolutely essential in almost all genres that you're doing. So when I do a script, if I'm doing like
a regular sketch, or a regular Vlog, I always break it down in;
setup-punch, setup-punch, setup-punch. It's incredibly imperative for me, since I
do monologues to the camera, that then have cut aways that
interrupt that monologue, to punch up whatever it was
that  I was previously saying. For narratives, for short films, there's no way
I can do a short film without a script. Cause it's so cost inefficient. If I show up on set and I'm like,
ok think, maybe we'll do a shot here ok, now that we are done with that shot,
maybe we'll go over here... that wastes everybody's time and you're
definitely not going to make your day, even if you have 16 hours
to complete your shoot. A way that I kind of break down my scripts into
production elements, is to go through it with different color highlighters, with each color representing a unique production element. So yellow can be props or pink can be costumes, that way, once your done with this color scheme, you can tell, at a glance, all the items that are
necessary to plan your production. Now the fun part. Controlling your budget and
breaking down your script. Yes. So having a script can allow you to gauge
what your overall budget will be, and help you determine, if realistically, you need to scale back on anything prior to shooting. This can be very, very important. Especially if
you're on a tight budget. The last thing you wanna do is overspend
on something you're not really willing to. Once you've gone through the script
and done all of that, write a list of everything that you need
to make your production happen. And once you've accounted for every single item, make a calculation and find out your total. And ask yourself, can you afford to make this film, with the script that you currently have? If not, then you might wanna go back and
rework scenes in your script, or cut down on the cost in some way. You might even consider cutting out
a scene entirely, that may not have been moving
the story forward anyway. I like to do a lot of
science fiction comedies. And usually those have elements with
prosthetics or robotic baby aliens of the sort. So it's very, very important that I know exactly
how much all this is going to cost me, so that my checks don't bounce. An example of being over budget that I remember is my short film Pregnapocalyse. Where these four girls wake up and they find out that every woman in the world, even little kids, who are female,
are all pregnant. And we don't know what the hell is going on. So for this short, I had to actually go back
and look at everything, cause the baby alien prop, that like
moved and smile and danced cost about $2,500. And my total budget for the entire thing
was about three to four grand. So to kind of accommodate that, I went back
and I rewrote it, so that everything took place in one setup. We did one long take instead of having a bunch of cut-aways to different aspects around the world. And that saved me so much time and
so much money, that we could put all of our attention on lubing up the baby and making sure we got the best smile from it and having it dance with like a little guitar. And kind of made me reevaluate where the money should be spent in a short like that, which of course, would be,
selling this tiny little baby alien. And kind of helped me reevaluate how
I do budgeting in general. You might wanna use dialogue that reflects
the voice of your target audience. And one really great thing about writing a script is, that it allows you to develop characters, and give them a specific voice that will really
speak to your fans. One of the most challenging aspects, I think,
for scriptwriting, is to reveal characters through action versus dialogue. And that is something that I currently struggle with. And when you notice it in a film or on TV,
it's brilliant. It's telling me something about a character,
without him having to say a single word. And that can be the way a character reacts to something, or the way a character looks at someone, in books, I know with J.K Rowlings Harry Potter,
we knew so much about Harry Potter just because of his aunt and uncle
and how much they hated him. And that made us love him so much more. And so it does come to a point, where
when you are writing your script, you don't want it to just be talking heads. You don't want people to just be talking about each other or talking about what's going on, or just doing dialogue for the sake of doing dialogue. There's so many instances in real life, when I will see something about someone,
and know who they are if someone was over there and just dropped their coffee and slowly walked away from it, and left. I would know a lot about that person. So dialogue exempt action, I think is the number one thing that I wanna work on in scriptwriting. And is also one of the strongest elements I've ever seen in the medium. And how does a script translate
in time on screen? And how long do people watch that for? Well one script page roughly equals one minute of screen time, that's kind of like the overall rule. So if you're trying for a five minute narrative short, but you have a nine page script, then you'll know right away that a lot of it needs to get cut. You can also tide in scripts based on your
viewers level of engagement. So if you look at your YouTube analytics, and see where fans are falling off, you might wanna think about making your content a little shorter, and closer to that engagement level. Or you may experience the opposite, where fans are fully engaged throughout, and that's maybe when you wanna consider having a bit more content there. Well I hope you learned a lot from this lesson, thank you so much for watching. If you wanna see more of Creator Academy stuff, you can go here. And if you wanna see more of me,

Here’s a step-by-step approach to adapting a short story into a feature-length screenplay:

1. Outline Your Expanded Narrative
   • Begin by dividing your original story into three acts—setup, confrontation, and resolution.
   • Identify key turning points and pivotal moments in the short story that can be expanded.
   • Consider how you can deepen the narrative by adding subplots or secondary characters.

2. Develop Rich Characters
   • Expand your protagonist’s journey, exploring both internal struggles and external challenges.
   • Flesh out supporting characters so that each has a distinct voice and purpose in the overall story.
   • Show character traits through actions and visual cues rather than just dialogue, letting the audience infer details.

3. Structure Scenes and Dialogue for a Longer Format
   • Break your story into individual scenes that clearly convey the setting, action, and dialogue.
   • Aim for a screenplay length of 90–120 pages (roughly one page per minute of screen time).
   • Write scenes that are visually engaging—remember, only what can be shown on camera should be in your script.

4. Build Tension and Stakes
   • Introduce conflicts where the stakes are high, whether life-or-death situations or significant failures.
   • Ensure each act contains escalating tension that keeps the audience engaged.
   • Interweave external conflicts (e.g., dangerous circumstances) with internal conflicts (e.g., personal growth or moral dilemmas).

5. Plan Production Elements Early
   • Mark out details like locations, props, and costumes in your script. A color-coded system (or another clear method) can help manage these production elements.
   • Consider budget and production constraints—if certain scenes are too costly, explore creative ways to achieve the same effect or cut scenes that don’t serve the core narrative.
   • Use your script to plan a realistic shooting schedule, ensuring that every scene has a purpose and is efficiently organized.

6. Embrace the Process of Rewriting
   • Don’t be afraid to write out extended scenes or dialogue that might initially feel like “exploration.” These can help uncover deeper story layers.
   • Set aside regular writing time to commit to rewriting and refining your screenplay.
   • Be open to restructuring your narrative if certain scenes or character arcs need further development.

7. Keep Audience Engagement in Mind
   • Regularly assess your pacing by comparing your script’s length with the intended runtime.
   • Use tension, conflict, and character development to hold the audience’s attention, ensuring that every minute on screen advances the story.
   • Tailor dialogue and actions to resonate with your target audience, making the film both relatable and visually compelling.

Following these steps will help you transform a concise short story into a full, dynamic feature-length screenplay that’s both narratively rich and production-ready.
