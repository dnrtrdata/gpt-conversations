# Blockbuster Movie Experience in a Casual-Controlled Mobile Game

## Define/Identify/Adhere-to/Track

### Hardware Targets
- Define the specific hardware platforms the game will support (e.g., iOS, Android, specific mobile devices).
- Ensure the game is optimized for performance and visual quality on these platforms.

### Player Constraints and Limitations
- Identify and document the constraints players may face, such as screen size, touch controls, and battery life.
- Design gameplay mechanics and user interfaces that accommodate these limitations.

### Fictional Technologies within the Game
- List and describe the fictional technologies present in the game world.
- Ensure these technologies are integrated consistently within the game's story and mechanics.

### GPT's Job (What to Do with the Information)
- Utilize the provided information to generate dialogues, scenarios, and narrative elements that align with the game's design.
- Assist in refining and expanding the game's storyline and character development.

#### Notes on the GPT's Job:
- Use the Save-the-Cat! story structure's predictable-yet-satisfying patterns to create mildly-challenging, highly-interesting gameplay opportunities/player-choice options utilizing movement mechanics. Express most, if not all, of the opening movement's cohesive and engaging narrative through these mechanics.
- Prioritize gameplay as a device to maintain the player's interest and emotional investment over "telling" the story with dialogue, narration, or any other storytelling device.
- Ensure the stakes are always:
  1. Survive by using movement mechanics.
  2. An extension of the former stakes.
- Find opportunities to make the player-character relatable through mechanics first. Express every possible aspect of the story, plot, and player-character by how the player navigates the player-character through the gameplay opportunities and choices provided. Define the experience by how the predictable-yet-satisfying patterns present these gameplay opportunities to the player.

### Player Character's Goals
- **Ultimate, Constant Goal:** Clearly define the overarching goal that drives the player character throughout the game.
- **Smaller Goals:** Identify the smaller, incremental goals the player character must achieve to progress toward the ultimate goal.

## Movement Mechanics Will Drive:

### a) First Impression
- Design the initial movement mechanics to create a strong, positive first impression on the player.

### b) Story's Fundamental Theme
- Use movement mechanics to convey the story's theme, reflecting the player character's "ordinary world" and its creatures.

### c) Gear and Choice to Move Deeper
- Show the player character's gear and decisions to venture further into the "extraordinary world" through movement mechanics.

### d) Secondary Plot (NO ROMANCE STATED)
- Develop a secondary plot that complements the main storyline without introducing romance.

### e) Story's Premise and Exploration
- Use movement mechanics to test the player character and explore the story's premise.

### f) Emotionally Impactful Event
- Create an event using creatures (possibly cute ones) that changes the story's direction meaningfully.
- Show the player character's resilience through movement mechanics to overcome the event.

### g) Mounting Pressure and Complications
- Design scenarios where the player character faces increasing pressure to survive and navigates complications.

### h) Dark Night of the Soul
- Orchestrate a moment where it feels like all is lost, building up to it and allowing time afterward to reinforce this feeling.

### i) Solution/Inspiration
- Develop a moment where the player character finds a solution or inspiration, pushing her towards the opening movement's climax.

### j) Final Confrontation and Mirroring Image
- Design the final confrontation of the opening story movement.
- Ensure the final imagery mirrors the opening image to create a cohesive narrative arc.

## Underwater Infinite-Runner Game Mechanics Document

2. **Directional Input in Calm Waters**:
   - **Vertical Movement**:
     - **Swipe Up**: Ascend.
     - **Swipe Down**: Descend.
   - **Horizontal Movement**:
     - **Swipe Left**: Move left.

3. **Turbulence**:
   - **Description**: Periodic turbulence affects the playerâ€™s control over their position.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: Player has ~25% control over their position, requiring more awareness and faster movements to avoid obstacles.
   - **Mechanics**:
     - **Resistance**: Movements require ~4x the effort compared to calm conditions.
     - **Strategy**: Players need to be more strategic in timing their movements to avoid obstacles and enemies.

4. **Fast Currents**:
   - **Description**: Sections where the player is pulled into faster up/down currents.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: Player has ~50% control over horizontal movements and almost no control over vertical movements.
   - **Mechanics**:
     - **Obstacle Navigation**: Arrange terrain and larger animals that the player must navigate and traverse.
     - **Point Multipliers**: Opportunities to earn multipliers by chaining moves together.
     - **Strategy**: Focus on chaining moves horizontally while managing minimal vertical control.

5. **Pressure Bursts**:
   - **Description**: Short-duration bursts of water pressure push the player towards the nearest edge of the screen.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: Player has ~75% effectiveness in movements.
   - **Mechanics**:
     - **Directional Influence**: Pressure bursts push the player, making control slightly more difficult.
     - **Game Over Condition**: If the player is knocked off-screen, they lose control and sink/flail out of sight, resulting in game over.
     - **Strategy**: Players need to be mindful of their position relative to screen edges and react quickly to pressure bursts.

### 2. Simplified Mobile Gestures
- **Automatic Forward Movement**: Continuous forward movement without player input.
- **Directional Input**:
  - **Calm Waters**:
    - **Swipe Up**: Ascend.
    - **Swipe Down**: Descend.
    - **Swipe Left**: Move left.
    - **Swipe Right**: Move right.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 100% control.
  - **Turbulence**:
    - **Swipe Up**: Ascend with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Swipe Down**: Descend with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Swipe Left**: Move left with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Swipe Right**: Move right with reduced effectiveness.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 25% control.
  - **Fast Currents**:
    - **Swipe Left/Right**: Horizontal movements with 50% control.
    - **Swipe Up/Down**: Minimal vertical control.
    - **Control Effectiveness**: 50% horizontal control.
  - **Pressure Bursts**:

2. **Directional Movement in Calm Waters**:
   - **Swipe Up**: Swim upward.
   - **Swipe Down**: Swim downward.
   - **Swipe Left**: Swim left.
   - **Swipe Right**: Swim right.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 100% control.
3. **Turbulence**:
   - **Swipe Up/Down/Left/Right**: Movements require more effort.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 25% control.
4. **Fast Currents**:
   - **Swipe Left/Right**: Horizontal movements.
   - **Minimal Control**: Vertical movements.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 50% horizontal control.
5. **Pressure Bursts**:
   - **Swipe Up/Down/Left/Right**: Movements slightly affected by pressure.
   - **Control Effectiveness**: 75% control.

### 4. Additional Considerations
- **Environmental Variety**: Different underwater settings (e.g., coral reefs, sunken ships) to keep the game visually interesting.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Incorporate moving obstacles, such as schools of fish or underwater currents, to add variety and challenge.
- **Buoyancy and Resistance**: Simulate water resistance to add realism to movements.

### Summary
