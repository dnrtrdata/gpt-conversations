you will need every resource you can

find to even have a chance of surviving

on the Broken

Road during the late game players

experience a massive spike in difficulty

as they now have the largest parts of

the map unlocked the deadliest enemies

and also some of the largest and most

difficult horde Encounters in the game

this is also the point where the game

opens up most of the remaining crafting

recipes for items that you will need to

face those biggest hordes and deadliest

enemies this video will help you find

plenty of crafting materials so you can

bring the fight to the

freaks just to the south of wizard

Island camp and near this broken bridge

there is a radio tower that looks like

it used to be a Survivor camp this

location is first on the list because

it's the easiest and safest to get to

conveniently close to a large camp

and fenced in it's pretty rare to

encounter enemies inside the fence aside

from a side mission that takes place

here this location is particularly good

for getting Growlers polystyrene and

kerosene all of which are needed to

craft the most powerful explosive in the

game the Napal

Molotov due east of wizard Island near

the Aspen but Ambush Camp you'll find

what appears to be an abandoned militia

Camp once you have cleared the nearby

Ambush Camp you can reach this loot

location pretty easily and you'll find

some really good stuff here not only are

there ammo tins here you'll also find

gunpowder cans and even an airbag for

one of the last recipes you get the

remote

bomb on the eastern border of the map in

the Highway 97 area of the map you'll

find one of the best and the most

dangerous crafting material loot

locations in the game the first horde

that the game gives you a mission to

destroy is fault at this location but

there is also a horde that lives here

outside of that mission though it is a

bit of a high-risk High reward situation

if you stick to looting only the

locations along the highway you should

be able to avoid The Horde entirely and

it will be worth your time not only is

this one of the single

best locations in the game to get

crafting materials you can also find one

of the only hidden loot locations that

is available to you in this section of

the game if you look around carefully

you can find items that are fully

crafted and ready to be used just grab

them and go to find all the spots to

pick up fully crafted items check out

the hidden loot locations video that I

Linked In the description there you have

it folks three great locations to find

crafting loot in the late game thank you

for watching we'll see y'all next time
