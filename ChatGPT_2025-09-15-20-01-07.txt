YOUTH PITCHING MECHANICS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR COACHES, PARENTS, AND PLAYERS

I. FOUNDATIONS: STANCE, FOOTWORK, AND START POSITION

a. Stance Width:
- Feet should be shoulder-width apart or slightly wider.
- Avoid feet close together—non-athletic, poor balance.

b. Foot Placement on Rubber:
- Windup: “Half-on, half-off” the rubber (heel on rubber, toe in dirt).
- Stretch: Feet stay shoulder-width or wider, especially for quicker, balanced movement.

c. Glove and Hand Position:
- Hands stay centered near the body’s center of mass (chest/stomach area).
- Avoid overly high or low hand placements—simplicity is key.

d. First Move:
- Use a slight angled step (not straight back or across) to begin the windup.
- Helps maintain center of mass and minimize head movement.

II. LEG KICK: CONTROLLED HEIGHT AND BALANCE

1. Height Target:
- Lift knee to “cereal bowl height” (waist level or slightly above).
- Too low = no momentum; too high = loss of balance and hip tension.

2. Foot Behavior:
- Let the foot dangle from the knee—relaxed, not tucked under the butt.

3. Stability:
- Avoid jerky or exaggerated motion. Consistency helps with repeatability and control.

III. DOWN THE MOUND: HIP LEAD, SHOULDER CONTROL, AND DRILLING

i. Hip Orientation:
- Begin moving down the mound by pushing the back hip out toward the plate.
- Prevents early forward lean, maintains power.

ii. Shoulder Angle:
- Shoulders should land level or slightly uphill.
- Avoid "downhill shoulders" which kill rotational power.

iii. Drill: Wall Hip Drill (aka Hershiser Drill)
- Stand arm’s-length from wall, place glove-hand on wall.
- Lift leg, push hip toward wall while staying sideways.
- Teaches control of hips and weight shift without torso twisting.

IV. GLOVE ARM MOVEMENT: SEMI-CIRCULAR PATH, NOT POINTING

A. Common Mistake:
- DO NOT point glove directly at the plate.

B. Correct Motion:
- Glove travels in a semicircle—down, out, and around to meet the body.
- Helps counter-rotate upper body while the lower half drives forward.

C. Impact:
- Promotes better timing, torque, and arm slot preservation.

V. STRIDE AND LANDING: FOOT STRIKE AND ARM POSITION

I. Landing Mechanics:
- Land on flat foot or heel, not toe.
- Keeps weight back, promotes smooth rotation.

II. Arm Position at Foot Strike:
- Throwing arm’s upper arm should be level or slightly upward from the shoulder.
- Avoid arm hanging down—leads to poor timing and mechanics.

III. Stretch Delivery Notes:
- From the stretch: use "knee knock" to start momentum.
- Focus on compact motion, quicker time to plate, and same hip-out movement.

VI. ROTATION AND FINISH: USING THE CORE, GLOVE, AND FOLLOW-THROUGH

A. Glove Side Mechanics:
- Glove tucks toward chest (don’t yank backward).
- Encourages proper trunk rotation and energy flow toward the target.

B. Core Engagement:
- Big muscles of the trunk initiate upper-body movement after landing.

C. Final Acceleration:
- Pitchers should throw with 99% intent—not aiming, not guiding.
- Think "drive the chest and chin toward the catcher."

D. Follow-Through:
- Arm finishes with bend, wrapping toward opposite side rib cage.
- Chest should be moving toward home plate, not upright.

VII. TEACHING TIPS FOR COACHES AND PARENTS

1. Simplicity Rules:
- Avoid overly detailed cues early on—focus on big body movements first.

2. Rhythm and Timing:
- Reinforce smooth transitions, minimal pauses, and one-motion movements.

3. Consistency and Drills:
- Repeat basic drills often (Wall Hip Drill, Knee Knock Start).
- Monitor for bad habits: glove stabs, over-rotations, loss of balance.

4. Do NOT Teach:
- “Aiming” the ball.
- “Pointing” glove at target.
- “Stopping” body mid-delivery for more accuracy.

5. Focus On:
- Direction, energy flow, balance, and aggressive finish.

VIII. GOALS FOR YOUTH PITCHERS

I. Early Phase:
- Learn control and stability.
- Repeat delivery for strikes and confidence.

II. Intermediate Phase:
- Introduce power concepts: hip lead, core torque, aggressive follow-through.

III. Long-Term Development:
- Encourage pitching as a full-body action.
- Instill habits that translate into velocity, command, and injury prevention.

YOUTH PITCHING MECHANICS: COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDE FOR COACHES, PARENTS, AND PLAYERS

I. FUNDAMENTALS OVERVIEW: THE THREE PHASES

I. BALANCE (Setup & Gather)
- Start athletic: feet shoulder-width or wider.
- Stand half-on, half-off the rubber (windup) or shoulder-width (stretch).
- Center hands near the body’s center of mass.
- Eliminate excess motion—minimize head and torso movement during setup.
- Goal: achieve balance and posture directly over the rubber before moving forward.

II. POWER (Stride & Launch)
- Begin with a slight angled step to initiate momentum.
- Leg kick rises to “cereal bowl height” (waist level or slightly higher).
- Maintain control—leg should dangle from the knee, not kick high or tuck under.
- As leg descends, push the back hip out toward home plate (hip lead).
- Glove arm starts semicircle path down and around (do not point at the plate).
- At stride foot contact:
  - Shoulders level or slightly uphill.
  - Stride foot lands flat or heel-first, never toe-first.
  - Upper body lines up: back elbow, shoulders, front elbow aligned with target.
  - Ball hand typically above back elbow, palm facing away from target.
  - Hips begin rotating after foot strike, creating torque.

III. FINISH (Rotation & Follow-Through)
- Glove arm tucks or firms at front side—avoid pulling or flailing wide.
- Chest and chin drive forward toward the target—no vertical stiff finishing.
- Arm follows through past the opposite side rib cage (wrap around finish).
- Trunk bends slightly over front leg; back leg may swing around or stay anchored.
- Head and eyes remain on target through release.
- Encourage 99% intent—no dart throwing or guiding.
- Finish should be balanced, athletic, and repeatable.

II. DELIVERY FROM THE WINDUP

a. Setup:
- Feet shoulder-width apart; half-on, half-off rubber.
- Hands centered near the chest/stomach area.
- Use a slight angled step to begin.

b. Leg Kick:
- Lift knee to waist-level (“cereal bowl height”).
- Avoid large or stiff kicks that disrupt center of mass.
- Maintain minimal head/torso movement.

c. Drive Phase:
- Push hip out as leg lowers to lead down mound.
- Glove arm rotates in semi-circle with torso.
- Shoulders stay level or tilt slightly uphill on descent.

d. Stride:
- Foot lands heel or flat, not on toe.
- Back hip remains engaged—weight should not shift early.

e. Arm Position:
- Arm up, back elbow equal or just below shoulder line.
- Ball should stay behind elbow, palm to sky or away from target.

f. Finish:
- Follow-through wraps around toward rib cage.
- Head and chest track straight toward home plate.

III. DELIVERY FROM THE STRETCH

1. Setup:
- Feet shoulder-width or wider; knees flexed.
- Compact posture; hands come together after sign.

2. Initiate Motion:
- Use a “knee knock” to begin—back knee subtly taps front knee.
- Promotes fluid transition from back to front without vertical lift.

3. Compact Power:
- Leg kick is faster and lower than windup.
- All other power and finish mechanics identical to windup.

IV. CORE DRILLS FOR REINFORCEMENT

i. WALL HIP DRILL (a.k.a. Hershiser Drill)
Purpose:
- Teaches controlled hip lead, preserves posture.

How-To:
- Stand arm's length from wall/fence, glove hand braced.
- Lift lead leg, slide hips sideways toward wall.
- Repeat to build balance and proprioception.

ii. FREESTANDING HIP LEAD
Purpose:
- Progression from Wall Drill; improves core control and balance.

How-To:
- Perform slow motion delivery emphasizing hip push and torso stability.
- No wall support; monitor head movement and trunk tilt.

V. COMMON COACHING DOs & DON’Ts

DO:
- Emphasize rhythm, simplicity, and controlled aggression.
- Teach directionality: “Take the body and ball to the target.”
- Reinforce hip lead, glove tuck, level shoulders, and arm wrap.
- Allow for variation in arm slot—as long as balance and direction are intact.

DON’T:
- Teach glove-pointing or arm-stabbing toward target.
- Overemphasize strike-throwing at the cost of intent.
- Teach kids to “guide” or “aim”—leads to stiffness and bad habits.
- Obsess over uniformity—allow natural motion within core fundamentals.

VI. LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT GOALS

I. EARLY STAGE:
- Build balance, simple repeatable mechanics.
- Prioritize accuracy and control of body over velocity.

II. INTERMEDIATE:
- Reinforce kinetic chain: leg drive > hip torque > trunk rotation > arm whip.
- Add focus on direction, timing, and posture under varying speeds.

III. ADVANCED PREP:
- Encourage max-effort intent with clean follow-through.
- Transition to deeper breakdowns: scap loading, internal rotation, arm path refinement.

our young pictures come in all different
shapes and sizes they have different arm
action different arm slots but pictures
at every level you're going to see a few
consistent things that they all do in a
similar fashion and it leads to success
and really we can break them down into
three areas
Balance power and finish so to start
with let's talk about balance this is
important so that we can get everything
gathered over top of the rubber we're
athletic we've got balance and once we
get to this position now a young pitcher
can get everything moving to home plate
that takes us into the next phase which
is the power phase we take our stride
stride foot lands and we want to be in a
strong power position with a good base a
little more weight on that back leg
still our upper body's got a nice line
back elbow through our shoulders through
the front elbow locked on our Target and
the ball is up over that back elbow
usually the hand back of the hand is
facing the catcher in that General
Direction that's a strong powerful
position in line to the target from
there we go into our finish we make that
forward move to home plate we release
the ball in the same spot every time we
get a good follow through and finish
with that flat back our chest out over
the front leg and our head chest still
right to the Target we're taking
everything to the Target in line so if
you can do these three things with your
young pitchers watch them have good
balance and athleticism get into a good
power position and then finish off that
pitch you're going to see more
consistent strikes a better delivery and
more success for those guys

YOUTH PITCHING COMPLETE GUIDE: MECHANICS, STRATEGY, AND EXECUTION

I. UNIVERSAL CORE PRINCIPLES (THE THREE PHASES)

I. BALANCE – CONTROL THE BODY
- Begin with feet shoulder-width or wider (windup or stretch).
- Position body half-on, half-off the rubber.
- Gather over the rubber: posture upright, center of mass stabilized.
- Hands stay at centerline—chest or waist level.
- Remove excess motion: minimal head movement, no stepping behind center.
- Goal: an athletic stance that sets the body up for a directional move to the plate.

II. POWER – CREATE AND TRANSFER ENERGY
- Initiate movement with slight angled step.
- Raise leg to “cereal bowl height” —not exaggerated or tucked.
- Push back hip out toward target as leg descends (hip lead).
- Stay level or slightly uphill with shoulders—resist falling into the mound.
- Land stride foot heel-first or flat, never on toes.
- At stride foot contact:
  - Strong base with slight back-leg load.
  - Back elbow → shoulder line → front elbow form a directional line.
  - Ball is above the elbow, back of hand angled toward the catcher.
  - Hips begin rotational energy transfer.

III. FINISH – DELIVER AND RECOVER
- Glove arm travels semicircle path, finishes tucked compactly (not yanked or flared).
- Chest and chin track directly to the target.
- Finish with a flat back, trunk over front leg, strong posture.
- Arm wraps toward opposite rib cage in follow-through.
- Avoid staying upright—this loses energy from trunk and legs.
- Consistent release point and follow-through enable repeatability and command.

II. WINDUP VS STRETCH

A. Windup:
- More moving parts—angled step, leg lift, hip lead.
- Best for low-pressure or bases-empty situations.

B. Stretch:
- Quicker, more compact; ideal with runners on base.
- Start with slight back leg weight, initiate “knee knock” to begin drive.
- Same hip lead and glove path apply.

III. REINFORCEMENT DRILLS

1. WALL HIP DRILL
- Stand arm’s length from wall/fence, glove hand braced.
- Lift leg and slide hip sideways toward wall.
- Encourages body control and proper hip lead motion.

2. FREESTANDING HIP CONTROL
- No wall; arms at chest or sides.
- Focus on controlling tilt, posture, and balance throughout leg lift and drive.

IV. STRATEGIC LAYER: PITCH CALLING & APPROACH

I. UNDERSTANDING GOALS BY COUNT AND SITUATION

a. Get Ahead Early:
- First pitch strikes establish control.
- Use fastball to both edges or elevated to surprise.

b. Pitch Sequencing:
- Mix locations: in/out, up/down—not just pitch types.
- Use breaking pitches after fastball to change timing.
- Changeups low in zone or below the zone work best when ahead.

c. Strikeout Approach (2-Strikes):
- Expand the zone, but start from a good strike.
- Elevate fastballs above swing plane or break balls out of zone.

d. Pitch to Contact (Early in Count or with Pitch Limits):
- Get ground balls with fastballs in or changeups low.
- Use defense efficiently—don’t always aim for strikeouts.

II. KNOW YOUR STRENGTHS

- Match pitch calling to pitcher’s current ability (not ideal arsenal).
- For young pitchers: rely on fastball control over movement-heavy strategies.

III. CONTROLLED INTENT AND EXECUTION

- All pitches should be thrown with intent—no guiding or aiming.
- Coach pitchers to “attack the zone” with conviction.
- Make each delivery look the same—mask pitch type.

V. COACHING REMINDERS

1. Praise Process, Not Just Outcomes:
- Reinforce consistent posture, strong direction, and confident delivery regardless of result.

2. Allow for Individuality:
- Different arm slots and rhythms are fine—focus on balance, direction, and finish.

3. Stay Positive Under Pressure:
- Teach pitchers how to reset after walks or hits—next pitch mindset.

4. Game Planning by Hitter Type:
- Aggressive hitter? Change speeds, elevate early.
- Passive hitter? Steal early strikes with fastballs.

VI. DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE TARGETS

A. EARLY STAGE (Ages 7–10)
- Emphasize balance, rhythm, and control.
- Use fastball to both sides and low in the zone.
- Encourage throwing to a target, not aiming.

B. INTERMEDIATE (Ages 11–13)
- Introduce sequencing: location + speed change.
- Reinforce intent and aggressive mentality.
- Add secondary pitches with purpose.

C. ADVANCED YOUTH (Ages 14+)
- Refine approach based on hitter tendencies.
- Practice situational awareness (inning, count, base runners).
- Develop out-pitch with matching setup strategy.

Here is the second transcript:

what's up baseball players I'm coach Dan
Blewett in today's video let's talk
about how to chop up the plate in the
middle
halves thirds and Corners to determine
what's the most effective pitch strategy
on a given count and how we can maximize
strike throwing with the idea that we
want to throw a quality pitch in some
counts more than others so in today's
video we'll talk about some pitching
strategy here in baseball and how we can
get the most out of our Command and the
strike zone so we can get more hitters
out
all right so if you're new here I'm Dan
Blewett I'm a former pro baseball
pitcher in the description links below
you'll find my online pitching courses
my three baseball books and other ways
to support the channel and to grow your
knowledge as a ball player so definitely
check those out so in today's video
let's talk about middle halves thirds
and corners and elevating and bouncing
pitches which are all the sort of main
locations that you'll throw to as a
pitcher so the big thing to cover and
I'll link to the description uh link
below where you can find my video about
the strike zone Basics and understanding
margin for error and how they interact
with the count but for now let's quickly
cover the fact that margin for air is
one of the main things that dictates
what you do as a pitcher and what you
throw in a certain count so margin for
error is how much can we miss and still
do the job that we're trying to do so a
good example is kicking a soccer ball
into an open goal if your only goal is
to kick it in the goal if there's no
goalie there then you would aim for the
center of the goal right that way if you
kick it a little bit to the right or a
little bit left or little bit High you
still maximize your chance of kicking in
the goal that's your only job right if
your goal only goal is to throw a cold
strike then the most logical thing to do
would be to throw it right down the
middle nor not throw it down the middle
but aim right down the middle that way
you can miss here you can miss there you
can miss here you can miss there you can
miss up you can miss down you can miss
in a lot of different directions and
still throw that called strike you have
as much margin for error as you can
if your goal is to throw a high quality
pitch and nail your spot on the corner
and you don't care if you throw a ball
because it's 0-2 then aiming for the
corner makes sense even though you'll
lose quite a bit of margin for error
because even a little Miss over here
becomes a ball whereas over here a
little Miss is still a strike so that's
the core thing to remember margin for
error is the underlying principle behind
where you set up based on the count and
the hitter in the situation margin for
error is is huge okay so let's talk
about how to cut up the plate to be most
effective based on the count so
basically if you're a coach and you want
to learn how to teach your kids how to
call pitches which I really think kids
should call their own game not coaches
then what you should do is explain that
an easy way to start this is to say that
each count sort of corresponds to a
different slice of the plate so when we
need it let's go down this first so
throwing down the middle aiming down the
middle we aim down the middle when our
main goal is just to throw a strike and
probably get ahead in the count or catch
up in the count so we aim down the
middle not because we want to end up
here we aimed in the middle because
again it gives us the most margin for
error and the counts that we would do
that on are 3-0 2o
1031 counts like that where we're pretty
far behind and we need to catch up again
there's exceptions to all this I won't
go down that rabbit hole in this video
because this is more of a Basics video
but in general you'll aim down the
middle when you're behind in the count
especially if you're more than two
pitches behind like 20 30 or three in
one the next location is cutting the
play 8 into two halves so you slice it
down the middle and then the catcher is
going to set up with the center of his
body and the center of his mitt
splitting one of the halves either the
outer half or the inner half depending
on the hitter and the halves they give
you they start to move the pitcher to
one side or the other so mentally it
helps the pitcher say I need to get the
ball in or I need to throw the ball away
but it doesn't give us too much you know
it doesn't put us too far to the corner
where we lose all of our margin for
error and then we're probably at risk of
falling behind or you know running the
count count back even
so splitting the plate into halves is
great on even counts especially so like
one one two two and three two is an even
count because basically you're full on
both balls and Strikes so going to the
halves on oh oh one one two two or three
two is a really good tactic especially
for amateur pitchers and my last note on
throwing to the halves Pro pitchers
including major league pitchers throw to
the half of the plate much more than
you'd realize when they're going first
pitch second Pitch even count they're
going on the halves quite a lot because
again it moves their their them mentally
to that part of the plate but it still
gives them a little bit of room to miss
and if you're on the half and you miss
by two inches in or away wherever your
Target's supposed to be that's on the
third of the plate and that's a high
quality pitch all right the next
location is the inner third or outer
third so splitting the plate into thirds
so you cut the plate into three slices
and ignore the middle slice so the
counselor you'd throw to the inner third
or outer third are going to be when
you're ahead in the count as a pitcher
so Owen one or one and two
again we could go down a rabbit hole in
this it could be one and one or even the
first pitch of the at-bat if it's a
really important situation The Hitter is
really really tough so it can always
depend but in general it's a great rule
of thumb to say we're going to go to the
thirds of the plate inner out of Third
only when we're ahead in the count so oh
one one two or even O2 but the thirds of
the plate is where it becomes really
difficult to hit as a hitter where
you're going to start to jam guys when
you go inside or they're really going to
have to be good to hit that ball hard
away because it's starting to get to the
wards the edge of the plate it's not so
much it's not so far in or out when
we're on the corners where we have very
little margin for error but the thirds
the inner third or outer third still
gives us a lot of plate to work with
while still being very effective if you
do hit your spot so inner outer thirds
are going to correspond to being a head
in the count all right in our last
location here is I'm gonna I'm gonna
lump a bunch together this is corners
Elevate or bounce and these all have
essentially the same intention which is
to either get a strike out or to just
throw the toughest possible pitch in
that situation so throwing a fastball in
the outer Corner inner Corner they're
not really strikeout pitches because
really they're only going to miss that
pitch if they're not very good or the
Umpire just calls them out on strikes
if you really want someone to miss and
to strike them out on a fastball you're
going to elevate that fastball because
that is where hitters they think they
can get up to but they really can't in
time especially if they're hard and you
have a good four seamer so it's good to
think of o2 as like your strikeout count
it's your main count to just say I'm
gonna strike this guy out and if I miss
I'm going to miss off the plate for a
ball and that's perfectly fine we don't
really want to do that on other counts
because it tends to run a pitcher's
pitch count up and especially for
amateur pitchers who don't have great
command if we get a chance to BO2 let's
try to get them to swing in the bat
while still trying to get that strike
out and then if we don't on one and two
we want them to put the ball in play
with weak contact that's where we go
back to the thirds of the plate and
don't try so hard to strike them out but
on O2 we can go to the corner inner
outer we can elevate a fastball which
means we're throwing it just above the
strike zone or you can bounce bounce
that curveball or slider or fade that
change up into the dirt those things
make sense because on O2 if we get the
strike out it eliminates the possibility
that they hit blooper that falls in they
hit a swinging bunt that we can't field
or they hit a ground ball that goes
through our Short Stops legs it
eliminates all that bad luck that's
present in baseball but I do again I
don't think it's a good tactic to do
that on anytime you get two strikes you
shouldn't be go hunting for strikeouts
on two two and one two as much because
and again situationally they can that
can make sense for sure but we don't
really want to be as strikeout focused
on those counts because it will tend to
run your pitch count up and if you're a
starter it's gonna be really hard to
make it later into games to make it
deeper into games and to eat up team
Innings that help your team win so when
you're O2 you can go to the corners
Elevate the fastball or bounce that
breaking ball alright so let's summarize
a really good pitching strategy simply
can be can involve slicing the plate
into four slices and giving each of
those slices a corresponding count so
aiming down the middle again this is
we're going from margin for error this
could be
30312010 or first of the abat
cutting the plate into halves that's
best for even counts like one one two
two three two going to the thirds of the
plate that's best for oh one one two or
O2 when you're heading the count and
then going to the corners of the plate
or elevating or bouncing a breaking ball
that's going to be best for Owen to
count so if you're a coach and you want
to start teaching your kids how to call
a smart game and help them learn the
Deep amazing strategy beside a baseball
this is a great place to start assign a
count to a slice of the plate so thanks

YOUTH PITCHING COMPLETE GUIDE: MECHANICS, STRATEGY, EXECUTION, AND PITCH-CALLING

I. CORE PHILOSOPHY: THREE PHASES OF EVERY PITCH

A. BALANCE
- Start with athletic stance: shoulder-width base, half-on rubber (windup) or even base (stretch).
- Gather body weight over the rubber—hands centered at chest/stomach.
- Quiet the body: minimal head/torso movement.
- Primary goal: arrive at the top of the delivery stable and ready to direct energy toward home plate.

B. POWER
- Begin motion with slight angled step (windup) or knee-knock (stretch).
- Leg kick reaches waist height (“cereal bowl” level)—relaxed, under control.
- Push back hip out as leg descends to create momentum down the mound.
- Land stride foot flat or heel-first; shoulders stay level/slightly uphill.
- Key checkpoints at foot strike:
  - Strong base; weight slightly back
  - Back elbow → shoulder line → front elbow in straight line
  - Ball above elbow, hand facing catcher
  - Hips rotate with glove arm tucking in compactly

C. FINISH
- Chest drives toward target; glove arm stays tucked.
- Arm follows through past opposite rib cage.
- Head/chest over front leg (flat back) with stable, balanced posture.
- Max effort with controlled mechanics: avoid “guiding” or “aiming.”

II. DELIVERY MODES: WINDUP VS STRETCH

1. Windup: More moving parts; use in low-pressure, bases-empty situations.
2. Stretch: Compact; ideal with runners on base. Use "knee knock" to initiate.

III. TARGETED DRILLS

i. Wall Hip Drill
- Stand arm’s length from wall/fence, lift leg, push hip sideways toward wall.
- Builds control and directional force.

ii. Freestanding Hip Control
- Same motion without support—builds trunk/core coordination and directional momentum.

IV. STRATEGY: COUNT-BASED PITCH LOCATION

1. MARGIN FOR ERROR
- The more central your target, the higher your chance to throw a strike.
- Strategy must balance intent with probability—center = forgiving, corners = precise.

2. PLATE DIVISIONS AND COUNT STRATEGY

I. DOWN THE MIDDLE – HIGH MARGIN ZONE
Use when:
- You need to throw a strike above all else.
- You’re behind in the count: 3-0, 2-0, 3-1, or 1-0.
Rationale:
- Maximize chance of throwing a called strike.
- Aim for middle, miss in any direction, still get a strike.

II. HALVES (INNER/OUTER) – CONTROL ZONE
Use when:
- The count is even: 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 3-2.
Rationale:
- Focus the pitcher’s mind on one side without giving up the whole plate.
- Keeps margin for error reasonable.
- MLB pitchers throw to halves often in early and neutral counts.

III. THIRDS (INNER/OUTER) – ADVANTAGE ZONE
Use when:
- You’re ahead: 0-1, 1-2.
Rationale:
- Forces weaker contact, disrupts hitters’ timing.
- Still enough zone to work with—more effective but slightly riskier.

IV. CORNERS / ELEVATE / BOUNCE – FINISH ZONE
Use when:
- You’re way ahead: 0-2 (strikeout count).
Rationale:
- Eliminate luck with weak contact—go for swing-and-miss.
- Throw tough pitches:
  - Elevated fastballs (above zone)
  - Breaking balls in dirt
  - Precise corners
- Avoid overusing in 1-2 or 2-2: runs up pitch count, lowers efficiency.

3. EXAMPLE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

COUNT            | LOCATION TARGET       | PITCH TYPE
-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------
3-0, 2-0, 3-1     | Middle of the Plate     | Fastball (aim for strike)
1-1, 2-2, 3-2     | Halves (inner/outer)    | FB, CH, breaking to edge
0-1, 1-2          | Thirds (inner/outer)    | FB inside, CH low, slider
0-2               | Corners, Elevate, Bounce| High FB, spike CB/SL, CH fade

V. COACHING IMPLEMENTATION

1. Let Players Call Their Own Game (Gradually)
- Teaches accountability, sequencing, understanding of hitters.

2. Assign Plate Slices to Count Types
- Introduce slicing strategy visually: middle, halves, thirds, corners.
- Associate each slice with count intent.

3. Use Visual Cues in Bullpens
- Draw plate zones on net or use colored targets.
- Practice pitch sequencing by count and target slice.

4. Reinforce “Miss Intent” Awareness
- It’s okay to miss off the plate when ahead.
- Bad misses happen when pitchers aim without purpose.

VI. PHASED DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

A. FOUNDATIONAL (7–10)
- Emphasize balance, consistent setup, and throwing to target with conviction.
- Introduce plate halves for early command awareness.

B. BUILDING (11–13)
- Teach pitch sequences: FB to CH, FB to CB.
- Reinforce situational goals (e.g., what to throw 1-1 vs 0-2).
- Begin using thirds of plate strategically.

C. ADVANCED (14+)
- Full incorporation of all zones and tactical adjustments.
- Blend strategy with mechanical intent.
- Introduce “pitch design” concepts (how spin/shape work best in count context).

VII. KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Think in *plate slices*—middle, halves, thirds, corners.
- Adjust strategy based on *margin for error* and *count leverage*.
- Combine mechanics + mindset + location awareness for a dominant youth pitcher.

hey what's up I'm coach Dan Blewett in
today's video let's talk about the
strike zone in baseball let's go over
the basics how the strike zone works the
size of the strike zone the expansion of
the strike zone why we use margin for
error as a good way of deciding what
pitch to throw based on the count how to
chop up the plate how Pros do it how
amateurs kind of screw it up and more
here in today's video about the strike
zone and counts
all right so if you're new here I'm
coach Dan I'm a former pro baseball
player you can look me up I have three
books about baseball and if you're
looking to learn more about the game I
highly recommend you pick up a copy so
in today's video let's talk about the
strike zone and how we chop up the plate
how we can understand the strike zone
and how margin for error helps us decide
what pitch to throw next now the reason
pitchers get hit hard is when they throw
too many pitches in the center cut
portion of the plate right so we know
that throwing the ball down the middle
of the plate is bad for pitchers and
it's good for hitters throwing the ball
on the corners of the plate and on the
edges of the strike zone whether it's
the bottom border or the very top border
is much harder for the hitter to make
solid contact on the barrel of the bat
so at a basic level one of the
fundamentals of good pitching besides
changing timing and throwing balls that
break and all those different things
that make it difficult to hit the ball
square is just to get your strikes by
throwing on the edges of the plate right
it's gonna be harder for the hitter to
Barrel up and hit the ball hard
now the problem with that and this is
why pitchers use margin for error and
this is one of my big gripes with
amateur baseball is that we have to use
a balance of margin for air to make sure
that we can be ahead in the count versus
falling behind an account now falling
behind in the count is bad because when
a pitcher is closer to walking a hitter
say it's a 2-0 count meaning two balls
and no strikes or three one count three
balls and one strike
that pitcher does not want to give a
free pass to The Hitter that's one of
the worst things a pitcher can do
because they didn't have to earn their
way on base and when hitters hit the
ball and play even when they don't hit
that hard they still get out right even
if they hit they hit it very hard they
still get out so a pitcher forcing The
Hitter to put the ball in play is a very
important thing he can do
walking them and giving them first base
for free is very bad so pitchers don't
want to walk hitters okay the problem is
the and this is what makes pitching so
tough is throwing to the corners of the
plate makes it much more likely that
you're going to miss outside of the
strike zone and thus fall behind the
count and thus either walk more hitters
or have to bring the ball back over the
middle of a plate to catch up on strikes
so what pitching ends up becoming is a
balancing act of throwing to the corners
where you have lesser margin for error
which I'll explain in a second and
throwing to the middle of the plate
where you have more more margin for
error so you can get ahead earlier so
here's the analogy if you had an open
goal in hockey or in or in soccer and
you're right there all you have to do is
kick in the goal where would you aim you
would aim in the dead center of that
soccer goal or that hockey goal right
because that gives you the most margin
for error where if you mishit it you
still have a couple feet to the right a
couple feet to the left a couple feet up
and down to still do the job which was
kick it in that open goal right or hit
it with your hockey stick it's the same
thing in pitching if I aim down the
middle I can miss a couple inches this
way this way this way and this way and
still throw a called strike so when a
pitcher really wants to throw a strike
it makes sense to aim down the middle of
the plate not because he wants to throw
it there but because if he aims there
and misses it gives him the most chance
of still throwing a strike even though
he didn't hit his spot exactly so the
goal of throwing or aiming down the
middle is never to throw it exactly down
the middle it's just to say hey this is
our Aim so now if you're not perfect
which no one is now you're gonna miss
and still be in the strike zone so that
is a tactic that makes sense when you're
behind in the count and you need to
catch up because it gives you a higher
likelihood of throwing a strike or early
in the count when you want to get ahead
of the hitter now when a pitcher gets
ahead and say the pitcher is 0-1 or 1
and 2 or 0 and 2 now it doesn't make
sense to aim down the middle as much
because we're not as worried about
throwing strikes and our main worry at
that point is throwing a quality pitch
that's hard for the hitter to hit so now
we might aim for the corner or the third
or the half which I'll get into in a
second
and that's going to give us less margin
for error because if we still miss with
the same relative grouping half our
misses are now going to be off the plate
and half our misses are going to be on
the plate whereas if we aim down the
middle a lot more of our misses will be
on the plate so aiming to the corner
gives us less margin for error because
about half or more of our misses are
going to be balls
so this is why when we have more strikes
as a pitcher and we're ahead we can
start to aim further off the plate and
still be safe because we have enough
likelihood of throwing a strike but a
high likelihood of throwing a quality
strike whereas earlier we'll aim down
the middle more often to give us a
higher likelihood of any strike but also
a less likelihood of a quality strike so
that's an important distinction and
that's a fundamental understanding that
all pitchers need to know because the
again the goal of throwing down the
middle is never to land it down the
middle to hit your spot down the middle
but instead to get you ahead in the
count which allows you to do other
things which we can cover now so the
other things that are important when you
get ahead in the account you can start
to throw your other pitches that are
less likely to be thrown for a strike so
every pitcher I mean maybe not every
pitcher but pretty much every pitcher
throws their fastball for the first
strike more than any other pitch because
it's straight
so if you throw your fastball for a
strike 70 of the time which is great you
might only throw your curveball for a
strike 50 of the time you might only
throw your chain up for a strike which
isn't your which is your third best
pitch maybe maybe 40 of the time so if
your life or the game depended on it and
you had to throw a called strike say it
was 3-0 with The Bases Loaded in the
winning run on third base if you had to
throw a strike you would pick your best
commanded pitch the pitch you throw for
a strike more than any other which is
usually your fastball
and so when you're behind it kind of
forces you to pick pitches that you'll
throw for a strike more often which are
more often fastballs that's good for the
hitter and bad for the pitcher when a
pitcher is a head in the count
he can say okay well I'm Owen two or I'm
Owen one so I'm ahead therefore I can
throw that change up that's going to be
harder for the hitter to hit because
they're not expecting a change up or the
curveball breaks and that's just a
harder pitch to hit I can throw that
pitch even though I'm only going to
throw it for a called strike 50 of the
time or 40 percent of the time but I can
throw it in this situation because I'm
so far ahead in the count that if I miss
I'm still not in any real danger of
Walking The Hitter and the hitter is
more likely to swing at it because
they're trying to not fall farther and
farther behind the count and that's what
we call expanding the strike zone and
this is another really important concept
so expanding the strike zone means that
hitters start to swing at more pitches
that are outside the strike zone because
they're afraid of taking a called strike
so if it's 0-2 and you as a pitcher
throw a pitch right here the hitter is
more likely to swing at that 0-2 because
they know the Umpire might call all that
borderline pitch even if it's a ball a
strike a hitter might swing at a
curveball that's breaking out of the
dirt or out of the zone and might be
caught here they might swing at that one
more likely on O2 because again they're
afraid of getting called out on strikes
on 2-0 or 3-1 or 3-0 a hitter is going
to be much more disciplined they're only
going to want to pick fastballs if they
can correctly identify the spin they're
only going to want to swing at pitches
that are center cut right down the
middle of the plate because they can be
picky because even if a pitcher throws a
called strike on three and one The
Hitter is still has the count in his
favor and they're not going to be called
out on strikes on that pitch so this
balance of who's ahead in the count
it really determines whether or not the
hitter is going to expand the strike
zone and start to swing at pitches that
are even worse for the hitter to hit so
hopefully this overview of how the count
and the size of the plate and margin for
error and now all those factors sort of
collide to Desert to determine what
pitch you'll throw as a pitcher
hopefully this overview has been helpful
because this is really the foundation of
making smart pitch calls and smart
location calls
in the strike zone too many amateur
pitchers make the mistake of when they
get a strike they immediately go to the
corner of the plate what's really more
important is using margin for air
effectively and by not always jumping to
the corner but maybe using the outer
half of the plate or the outer third of
the plate which gives you a good blend
of both a high quality pitch potential
and more margin for errors you can get
the strike that you need all right so if

YOUTH PITCHING COMPLETE GUIDE: MECHANICS, STRATEGY, PITCH CALLING, AND STRIKE ZONE MANAGEMENT

I. FOUNDATIONAL PHASES OF DELIVERY

A. BALANCE
- Start with athletic posture over the rubber; feet shoulder-width apart.
- Keep hands centered near chest/stomach; stillness before motion begins.
- Avoid stepping across or behind—maintain clean directional path to target.

B. POWER
- Use a slight angled step or knee-knock to initiate.
- Raise leg to waist height (“cereal bowl” level), relaxed foot.
- Push hip out on descent; land stride foot heel-first or flat.
- Align body: back elbow → shoulders → front elbow; upper body stacked and balanced.

C. FINISH
- Glove arm travels semicircle path and tucks compactly.
- Chest and chin drive through target.
- Arm finishes through opposite side of body; trunk bent forward over front leg.
- Consistent release point; full-body engagement from legs up.

II. STRIKE ZONE AWARENESS & STRATEGIC LOCATION

A. CORE STRIKE ZONE CONCEPTS

1. Central Zone = High Margin for Error
- When behind in the count, aim down the middle—not to land it there, but to give yourself 5-way miss coverage (left/right, up/down, and still land in zone).
- Middle zone is best for 2-0, 3-0, 3-1, and sometimes 1-0 counts.

2. Corners = Low Margin for Error
- Corners offer the highest pitch quality but the lowest forgiveness.
- Use when ahead in the count and NOT needing a guaranteed strike.

3. Expansion = Strategic Risk
- Expand the zone when ahead (0-2, 1-2).
- Elevated fastballs and breaking balls in the dirt increase chase potential.

B. STRIKE ZONE STRATEGY BY COUNT

COUNT TYPE        | TARGET ZONE             | GOAL
------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------
3-0, 2-0, 3-1      | Center of Plate          | Maximize chance of strike
0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 3-2 | Halves (inner/outer)     | Maintain control + location
0-1, 1-2           | Thirds (inner/outer)     | Limit quality contact
0-2                | Corners / Elevate / Bounce | Go for strikeout, induce chase

C. PITCH TYPE SELECTION BASED ON COUNT

- Behind in count:
  - Throw your best-commanded pitch (usually fastball).
  - Avoid low-strike % pitches (e.g., breaking balls, changeups).
- Ahead in count:
  - Mix in off-speed to change timing and increase weak contact odds.
  - Use expanding pitches even if they miss (curveball in dirt, high FB).

D. MARGIN FOR ERROR – THE CORE PRINCIPLE

- Think like a soccer player shooting at an open goal: aim center for max forgiveness.
- Aim middle when strike is critical.
- Aim edges when you can afford a miss—because the reward (whiff or poor contact) is higher.

E. EXPANDING THE ZONE – A PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE

- Hitters expand their zone when they’re behind in the count.
- Use this to your advantage:
  - 0-2: Hitters will chase pitches just off the plate or breaking out of the zone.
  - 2-0, 3-1: Hitters are more selective—only swing at obvious strikes.

III. TEACHING STRATEGY TO YOUTH PITCHERS

A. Plate Slicing System:
- Teach players to divide the strike zone by count:
  - Middle for “must-strike” counts.
  - Halves for “neutral” or “even” counts.
  - Thirds for “advantage” counts.
  - Corners for “put-away” counts.

B. Avoid Common Youth Mistakes:
- Don’t jump straight to corners after one strike.
- Don’t throw breaking balls when behind unless it’s reliably in-zone.
- Don’t “aim” pitches—teach to “attack zone with conviction.”

C. Repetition + Intent:
- Practice hitting each zone slice by name in bullpens.
- Rehearse count-driven strategy as much as mechanical drills.

IV. ADVANCING DEVELOPMENT THROUGH STRATEGIC LENSES

I. AGES 7–10:
- Reinforce zone recognition with emphasis on middle and halves.
- Focus on balance, direction, and consistency.

II. AGES 11–13:
- Introduce thirds and basic sequencing (FB to off-speed).
- Start developing situational game sense—what to throw when.

III. AGES 14+:
- Full integration of count-based pitch strategy.
- Train for pitch deception, sequencing by hitter profile, and advanced execution.

Good. Please do the same with the following transcript:

Okay so let's talk about the strike zone
and home plate because this is really
important so the counts determine where
we're gonna aim on the plate and one of
the major things that's going to
determine where we aim is the concept of
margin for error
so margin for error means how much you
can miss and still do the job so if you
were kicking into a soccer goal would
you aim to the edge if there was no
goalie would you aim to the edge no you
would still aim for the middle because
then you can miss to the right you can
miss to the left and still kick it in
the goal right so in pitching one of the
first goals early in the count is to
just throw a strike and get ahead of the
hitter so the reason we aim down the
middle is not because we want to throw
the pitch actually down the middle right
this is an easy pitch to hit this is
where good hitters want to hit the ball
right so then a quest a valid question
would be well if hitters like this pitch
why would I choose to throw it here
right
we only throw it we only aim down the
middle because our goal is to give us
the most margin for error to throw a
strike and get ahead of the hitter
because when you're down in the count
say you're hitting and you have two
strikes and a pitcher throws a ball over
here you might swing at it because
you're afraid of the umpire calling you
out on strikes right that makes sense
so this is what we call making a hitter
expand the strike zone
so as a pitcher gets ahead in the count
when he gets more strikes on the hitter
so such as oh one or one and two or oh
and two hitters become defensive and
they start to swing at pitches that they
ordinarily know are not good pitches to
hit so for this reason as a pitcher one
of your best strategies is to try to get
ahead and account to get a strike as
early as possible especially on the
first pitch and now the more strikes I
get as a pitcher so say I'm oh and to
the consequences of Miep throwing a ball
and then throwing a ball they're not
very high because I still am too into in
the count right so the more I'm ahead
the more room I have to miss and the
more hitters will help me out by
swinging it bad pitch
all right so as a hitter it works the
opposite way if a pitcher falls behind
in the count so say you're hitting and
it's two balls and no strikes there's no
reason you should swing it a pitch over
here because there's no risk of you
getting called out on strikes right so
as a hitter when you're ahead and
account when there's more balls than
strikes you're acceptable zone of stuff
you swing at get smaller you get more
selective so when it hitter is behind in
the count he will swing at more bad
pitches because he's defensive when it
hit her is ahead in the count
meaning the hitter has more balls and
strikes he does not have to swing at
these pitches he will then you will then
contract the amount of pitches he will
swing at he will only swing it the very
best pitches in the middle of the zone
does that make sense to everyone thus
far so playing this strategy is
important as a pitcher you want to get
ahead as soon as possible and the more
ahead of the hitter you are as a pitcher
the more you then can start to aim for
the edges of the plate if a pitcher
falls behind the count so say I throw a
ball one and then I throw a ball two now
I need to go back over the middle to
give myself margin for error to try to
catch up in the count so I don't walk
him so there's always this risk and
reward of where we're aiming based on
what the count is so the way we then
sort of choose our locations are kind of
by slicing the plate into either halves
thirds or corners so in these four
different zones number one is down the
middle so this gives us again the most
margin for error and pitchers will aim
down the middle when we are either
behind an account or it's the first
pitch because we want to try to get a
strike as soon as possible so we would
throw down the middle on Ojo one oh two
oh three oh three one two one and then
once you've gotten a strike we're gonna
cut the plate into two halves and we're
gonna throw to the middle of each half
and our catcher will move so the center
of his body is centered up with that
half of the plate so now I'm still
aiming for a lot of the plate so I still
have a lot of margin for error but I'm
starting to lose a little
so when you're on the half I can still
miss here I can still miss here I can
still miss all the way over here and
still get a strike so we would go to
halves when we're even counts 1 1 2 2 3
2 because when we're at an even count
it's still very important to get to the
next a head count or any at-bat so 1 1
getting to 1 2 is very important then
the next thing we would slice the plate
into thirds so middle third one this
side third and this side third so it
could be inner third or outer third
inner third or out of there and then
we're gonna pitch ignore the middle
third and we're gonna pitch to the
center of this third or this there so
now you can see we're starting to lose
margin for error over here right you
could be very accurate but this is a
ball but because we're gonna use this in
accounts when we're ahead it's okay that
we don't have as much margin for error
so we're gonna throw to the thirds like
one or the other on own one or one and
two for the most part now if we go
two-thirds early so say it's the first
pitch we aim to the third and we miss
now we're behind in the count and now we
have to try to catch up so we end up
going back over that's why you want to
start going to the edge of the plate
only when you start to get ahead of the
hitter okay so again oh one or one two
or thirds and then lastly when we're
going to we're super far ahead of the
hitter so we can aim for the corners
with no downside really now when we row
into our goal as a pitcher is probably
to get a strike out if we can on that
one pitch so that means throwing a pitch
that's a borderline ball strike this is
the time where if we threw a curveball
we would try to bounce the curveball or
throw the slider that breaks out of the
zone or elevate a fastball because
hitters like to chase high fastballs so
oh no and - we might go in the corner
the corner
we might elevate a fastball to get them
to chase we might bounce a curveball
where we might have a slider that breaks
out of the zone the goal oh no - is to
throw a pitch that looks like a strike
but ends up a ball by time they swing
but we won't try to get strike outs on
any of the other counts because if we
try to do that we're going to end up
bouncing too many
is missing too much and our pitch count
will get very very high and then
pitchers won't be at a pitch very deep
in the games they won't be the pitch
many innings so for starting pitchers
especially we need to go five six seven
innings that means only twelve or
fifteen pitches per inning so if you're
trying to strike everyone out and now
you're throwing six pitches per batter
you're not going to end up making that
five six seven innings that we need from
you as a team so starting pitchers
hopefully you can give your team six or
seven innings but in seven innings
you're going to typically face about 30
batters and for a starting pitcher you
usually won't throw more than a hundred
pitches in a start so if you do the math
a hundred pitches divided by thirty
hitters is about three and a half
pitches for a bat so three and a half
pitches of per bat means we need to have
hitters put the ball and play early and
get out early in the count in one two or
three pitches for us to go six or seven
innings and on only 100 pitches we need
every batter to get the ball into play
in hopefully less than four pitches so
our goal is pitchers for almost every
count
except 402 is to have the hitter hit the
ball we want him to put the ball into
play that means to hit it into fair
territory Hold'em they don't find you've
gone his brain is melting right now
there's a lot of translation yes terms
you don't have a word so our goal is as
a pitcher is to get weak contact we want
the hitter to hit the ball early in the
count if we get them to hit the ball
weakly early in the count
we'll get outs fast and pitchers will be
able to pitch lots of innings which
helps the team whereas if you try to
strike everyone out you'll end up
throwing five six seven pitches for it
back and then you want you to make it
very many innings so let's talk about
that from the hitters perspective a
little bit more so hitters your goal is
always to drive pitches that are in the
middle of the plate in the middle of the
strike zone so your goal is pitches on
the edge of the strike zone or that are
balls we want to take them and not swing
at them as a hitter when you get ahead
in the count meaning
there's more balls and strikes your goal
is to have a smaller more selective
strike zone of pitches that you swing at
when you fall behind in the count you do
have to protect from striking out a
little bit more which means you have to
swing at pitches that are more
borderline but your goal as a hitter is
only to swing at these borderline
pitches when you have to only when it's
like 1 and 2 or oh and 2 where you might
strike out otherwise take those pitches
and wait for a pitch that's more in the
center portion of the plate so we looked
at some heat maps earlier right of some
major league players they swing the most
when the ball is in the middle and they
take the most when the ball is in a part
of the zone or is a as a ball when they
can't drive that pitch very well and the
thing to remember the number one the
number one best thing you can do as a
hitter is not making out outs are the
most valuable thing in baseball so yeah
a homerun is more valuable than a single
but if you can go up there and walk or
get a base hit those are the best things
that you can possibly do so it pays off
to be selective on the stuff on the
pitches that you swing at because if
you're very very selective pitchers will
miss a lot and you're their pitch counts
will go up which means the best pitchers
will have to be replaced by released
pitchers when you take more pitches you
will get ahead and account more often
you will walk more often which puts
runners on bases and runners on bases or
runners on base gives you a chance to
score and lastly you won't waste your
swings on pitches that you can't hit
hard this is a very hard pitch to hit
hard no matter how good you are so you
want to save your swings for when you
have a better chance of hitting the ball
hard so it is a very good thing as a
hitter to be patient to end to be
selective to only swing at the best
strikes that you want to swing at
you

YOUTH PITCHING COMPLETE GUIDE: MECHANICS, STRATEGY, ZONE MANAGEMENT, AND GAME EFFICIENCY

I. STRIKE ZONE STRATEGY REINFORCEMENT: MARGIN FOR ERROR BY COUNT

A. UNDERLYING CONCEPT: MARGIN FOR ERROR
- Definition: How far a pitcher can miss their target and still achieve the desired result (typically a strike or weak contact).
- Aim down the middle to maximize margin when needing to simply throw a strike.
- Aim for the corners only when a miss won't harm the count or when the objective is swing-and-miss.

B. STRIKE ZONE SLICING SYSTEM

1. ZONE #1 – MIDDLE (MAX MARGIN)
Use When:
- Behind in count (e.g., 3-0, 2-0, 3-1, 2-1)
- First pitch (0-0)
Why:
- Highest chance of strike if miss occurs
- Helps pitcher avoid walks and regain count control

2. ZONE #2 – HALVES (GOOD MARGIN)
Use When:
- Even counts (1-1, 2-2, 3-2)
Why:
- Balances control with directionality (inside or outside)
- Still provides reasonable room to miss and remain competitive

3. ZONE #3 – THIRDS (LIMITED MARGIN)
Use When:
- Pitcher is ahead (0-1, 1-2)
Why:
- Intentionally targeting tougher zones for weaker contact or borderline strikes
- Greater risk but higher pitch quality

4. ZONE #4 – CORNERS / ELEVATION / BOUNCE (NO MARGIN)
Use When:
- Deeply ahead (0-2 only)
Why:
- Designed to induce chase or strikeout (e.g., bounce curve, elevated fastball)
- Pitch should *look* like a strike but finish out of zone

II. COUNT-DRIVEN LOCATION STRATEGY SUMMARY

COUNT               | TARGET            | GOAL
--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------
0-0, 2-0, 3-0, 3-1   | Middle             | Get a strike, reset count
1-1, 2-2, 3-2        | Halves             | Stay competitive, control contact
0-1, 1-2             | Thirds             | Limit hitter options, induce weak contact
0-2                  | Corners/Bounce     | Finish the at-bat, induce swing-and-miss

III. STRATEGIC CONSTRAINTS FOR YOUTH STARTERS

- Goal: ~100 pitches across ~30 batters = ~3.3 pitches per hitter
- Translation: Induce contact in 1–3 pitches per AB
- Don’t overuse strikeout strategy—reserve for 0-2 only
- Most ABs should result in weak contact early

IV. HITTER REACTIONS BY COUNT

1. BEHIND IN COUNT (0-2, 1-2)
- More likely to swing at borderline pitches
- Defensive mindset—may expand zone

2. AHEAD IN COUNT (2-0, 3-1)
- Selective mindset—waits for perfect pitch
- Shrinks swing zone to only optimal locations

V. PITCHER’S OBJECTIVE BASED ON COUNT

A. GETTING AHEAD
- Always prefer to be 0-1 than 1-0
- Early strike opens up strategic options (off-speed, edges)

B. STAYING AHEAD
- After 0-1: throw to thirds (in/out)
- After 1-1: prioritize edge of halves

C. PUTTING AWAY (0-2 ONLY)
- Throw chase pitch: elevated FB, bounced curve, fading CH
- Don't waste this opportunity with low-intent middle-zone pitch

VI. EFFICIENCY MINDSET FOR STARTERS

- Pitch economy matters: 
  - Avoid 6+ pitch ABs unless situationally required (e.g., critical batter in late game)
  - Teach pitchers to expect early contact, not fear it
  - Weak contact = strategic success

- Throw pitches designed for contact in non-strikeout counts
  - Fastball halves or thirds
  - Changeup low
  - Slider for weak rollovers

VII. HITTING STRATEGY (COACHING PERSPECTIVE FOR PITCHERS)

- Hitters swing most at center-cut pitches, least at edges
- Hitters expand zone only when behind in count
- Patience in hitters raises pitch counts—force weak contact before that happens
- Pitchers must know when to challenge and when to deceive

VIII. FINAL PITCHING STRATEGY PRINCIPLES

1. Use central aim for strikes, not to give up barrels.
2. Move outward as you gain count leverage.
3. Use expanding pitches when the risk is minimal (e.g., 0-2).
4. Prioritize early weak contact to maximize innings.
5. Know the difference between a "strike" and a "quality strike."
6. Don’t chase strikeouts early—they’re pitch-count killers.

Good. Now please distill the info in the clearest, most-coherent version it can be WITHOUT sacrificing efficiency and simplicity in conveying the info. We'll use it for more than one age-group, but keep your condensed guide at a reading/comprehension level of a first-year Little League pitcher.

YOUTH PITCHING QUICK-GUIDE  
(Designed for first-time Little League pitchers, usable at all levels)

I. THREE BIG PHASES OF EVERY PITCH

A. BALANCE  
- Start with feet shoulder-width apart.  
- Keep hands near chest. Stay still before you move.  
- Don’t rock, sway, or step behind yourself. Stay balanced over the rubber.

B. POWER  
- Begin by lifting your front leg to waist-height. Let your foot hang.  
- Push your back hip toward home plate as the leg goes down.  
- Land on your heel or flat foot.  
- Keep shoulders level or slightly tilted up.  
- Arm should be up before you land—ball facing the catcher.

C. FINISH  
- Glove tucks into your body—not out wide.  
- Chest and head move toward the catcher.  
- Arm finishes across your body.  
- Stay balanced after the throw.

II. WHERE TO AIM (BASED ON THE COUNT)

A. MARGIN FOR ERROR  
- “Margin for error” means how much you can miss and still throw a strike.  
- Aim for the middle when you *need* a strike.  
- Aim for the edge only when you’re ahead in the count.

B. ZONES TO AIM FOR

1. MIDDLE OF THE PLATE  
- Use on: 0-0, 2-0, 3-0, 3-1, 2-1  
- Goal: Just throw a strike. Use your best pitch (usually fastball).

2. HALVES OF THE PLATE (inside or outside)  
- Use on: 1-1, 2-2, 3-2  
- Goal: Hit a side of the plate, still keep good chance of a strike.

3. THIRDS OF THE PLATE (inside third or outside third)  
- Use on: 0-1, 1-2  
- Goal: Harder to hit, good for soft contact.

4. CORNERS / HIGH / LOW  
- Use only on: 0-2  
- Goal: Try for a strikeout. Throw tough pitch—high fastball, low curve, etc.  
- If you miss, it’s okay—you’re still ahead.

III. WHAT TO DO EACH COUNT

COUNT        | AIM FOR      | GOAL  
-------------|--------------|--------------------------  
0-0          | Middle       | Get ahead  
2-0, 3-0     | Middle       | Avoid a walk  
1-1, 2-2     | Half         | Stay even or get ahead  
0-1, 1-2     | Third        | Force weak swing  
0-2          | Corner/Out   | Try to get swing-and-miss

IV. WHAT PITCH TO THROW

- Behind in count: Use your best pitch for strikes (usually fastball).  
- Ahead in count: Mix in off-speed—changeup, curve, slider.  
- 0-2 count: Throw something that *looks* like a strike but ends outside zone.  
- Most of the time: Make them hit it early, get quick outs.

V. BIG PITCHING GOALS

1. Throw strikes early.  
2. Try for weak contact, not strikeouts.  
3. Keep pitch count low.  
4. Stay balanced and repeat your motion.  
5. Learn to miss in the right spot—not by accident.

VI. HITTER HABITS (KNOW THIS)

- Hitters swing more when *they're* behind in the count.  
- Hitters swing less when *they're* ahead.  
- Get ahead early and they’ll chase more.  
- Stay behind and they’ll wait for the perfect pitch.

VII. KEY RULES TO REMEMBER

1. Balance before movement.  
2. Push your back hip to the catcher.  
3. Chest goes toward home at the end.  
4. Aim for the middle early.  
5. Move to the edges as you get ahead.  
6. Strikeouts only when the count is 0-2.  
7. Don’t be afraid of contact—just make it weak.

Please do the same with the following transcript:

What's up!
Coach Dan Blewett here.
In today's video.
We're going to cover some of the best
pitching drills for baseball players.
We're also going to cover
some of the worst
drills for baseball players.
So in this long video, it's
going to be very detailed.
You're going to see 13
different pitching drills.
I'm going to talk by talk about why
some of them are trash and why some
of them are really good replacements
and are really, really effective.
So there's going to be timestamps
and the description here.
So if you want to jump back and
forth, you're welcome to do that.
We're going to start with the
bad drills and then get to
the good drills at the end.
But remember, as a parent or a player
or a coach, it can be tough to figure
out is this a good drill for me?
Is this going to make my mechanics better?
Long-term is this going
to be good for my career?
You can have a pitching coach who
gives you great instruction and
helps you get where you want to go.
You could also have a coach that
doesn't really know what they're
doing and is giving you drills
that are actually hurting you.
So hopefully in today's video is
going to clear up a lot of those myths
about good versus bad pitching drills.
Okay.
So first thing let's jump
into bad pitching drills.
These are bad youth pitching drills,
they're pad advanced pitching drills.
I just don't like them.
Some have more merit than
others, but again, I want to
give you much better options.
So we'll cover those at the
end of the video, but these
are the bad pitching drills.
All right.
This drill is the quick rocker.
And I don't understand why
people do this, do it this way.
So number one, pitching is
very rhythmic that activity.
And when I see most players
doing rocker drills like this.
I don't understand what
they're trying to accomplish.
And I also don't understand when in
pitching, are they bending their knees
with this shallow, like very fast fashion,
there's a, a much better way to do the
rocker drill, which I'm going to cover
later in this video, but this drill
doesn't accomplish anything in my mind.
It's just a different way of
throwing and we shouldn't be doing
drills that are just different.
We should be doing drills
that have a specific purpose.
And I can't for the life of me, figure out
what the purpose is of this quick rocker,
where I'm just wiggling back and forth.
Essentially.
It really doesn't make any
really doesn't make much sense.
All right.
So this next drill is, uh, called
the connection drill or whatever
you want to call it, but you take
this little mini stability ball
and you put it in your angle or in
the angle of your elbow to help you
reinforce having a good elbow angle.
Now, this makes sense.
Uh, if you throw out here with
a big up to sell angle, that's
gonna reduce your velocity is
gonna put more stress on your arm.
So having this squeezed in here
is going to reinforce like, this
is where I have to throw from.
Here's my thing with
this, this drill is okay.
I put it in the bad drills
category, but it's an okay drill.
But almost everyone I've worked with says,
Dan, this is like the most awkward drill.
I hate it.
It just like doesn't work well.
And I've done this many, many times.
I always do all the drills that I'm
going to work with my players on.
And I find the same thing.
I feel, I feel like it's just
exceedingly awkward, uncomfortable,
where kids just don't buy into it and
you have to buy into what you're doing.
So some players might swear by this,
the vast majority of players find
this to be extremely uncomfortable.
So let me demonstrate
you can also put the ball underneath
your arm, in your, kind of like in
your armpit, uh, to help reinforce.
Guys that lift their arm too much.
So if you have your arm up here, keeping
the ball down here prevents that lifted.
Yeah.
Less awkward that way, but
still extremely awkward.
So again, this can be a useful
tool, but almost everyone
including myself hates this drill.
All right.
The next pitching drill
that I really hate.
I grew up doing this.
This is the towel drill.
The towel drill is awkward.
It's an unclear.
If the path that the followed that the
towel takes is a good path for our arm.
Really.
When I see players doing the towel drill,
I see a lot of low elbows where their
elbows are bent instead of extending.
And I think that's in part because
of the towel, the towel flutters in
the air, it's everything about it.
You know, the hand position is not like
a baseball, pretty much everything about
the child rule is awkward and there's
a much better replacement for it.
All right.
Next to my list of drills that
are just absolutely terrible.
Is the wrist flip.
So, if you warm up like this, propping
your elbow up and flicking, you're
just wasting a significant amount of
your own time and your player's time.
I don't know why we need a
dedicated up for the risks.
The risks is just a slave
to the rest of the arm.
No high-level college baseball
players do this drill.
No high-level pro players
do this drill course.
They're all high level.
Literally anyone.
This is, this drill has been left in
the past by almost everyone except
for youth baseball, youth baseball.
So, again, this with our elbow in front
of our body is a bad throwing position.
So we're reinforcing a
very bad way of throwing.
And why are we wasting time working
on flipping the ball, your hand?
The common thing I hear about this
drill is that, Oh, you want to teach
kids to be, to get good spin and be
behind the center of the ball, just
because that's your goal of the drill.
Doesn't mean the drill actually
accomplishes that this is so unlike
regular throwing that I can't see
any carry over into real throwing
when your arm is moving exceedingly
fast, as fast as human movement.
And it's coming from a
completely different arm slot.
Really what enforces good spin
and being through the center
of the ball is good mechanics.
When you're teaching proper
pitching mechanics, everything
else takes care of itself.
This drill is an utter waste of time.
All right.
The next drill that I think is just
a complete waste of time and probably
bad for your mechanics in general is
it can be called the finished drill.
It's called different things for
different people, but basically
starting in this position and then.
Working on throwing the ball and finishing
the problem is this is one of those drills
that like, Oh, he might think, yeah, I got
to work on the last part of my mechanics.
That makes sense.
It doesn't make sense because
pitching the motion is so fast.
It's again, your arm lays back and forward
forth is the fastest human movement.
It's so fast that we're taking
the fastest, the absolute
fastest part of the delivery.
When are you?
Hips are finishing their rotation.
And when the arm is laying back
celebrating, we're taking that part
of the delivery and we're stopping it.
This is incredibly uncomfortable.
My arm does lay back anywhere
near how much it naturally would.
If I was throwing a ball slowly
and my chest is facing my partner.
And really this is just reinforcing me
being a pusher and pushing the ball.
There are some parts of the delivery
that you just cannot stop and go.
And this is absolutely one of them.
So do not ever do a drill that
looks like this, or you're
finishing it and you're working on
this last part of the mechanics.
It's a bad drill.
It makes no sense.
And it's probably hurting
your pitching mechanics.
All right.
The next drill that's really,
really terrible for your
mechanics is the L drill.
So this was a classic teach, right?
You point the ball to center field.
You start with this position
here and then you throw.
Well, the arm is always
moving through that position.
So even though some coaches, it
might've been trying to get you into
this L position to teach it, to have
that good 90 degree or less arm angle.
It's not good.
Good idea.
Because putting you in that
position, doesn't teach your body
how to it gets to that position.
And that's really the key here.
It's not about, Oh, this
is where you want to be.
Okay.
Coach wall.
How do I retrain my arm to get
there when it needs to get there
in the right proper timing?
That is the key.
So you can do drills where
your arms are started apart.
I don't think they're, I don't usually
don't think they're a good idea, but
they can work in some instances, however,
you don't want to start paused in the
exact position that you want to be in.
So in this drill, Hey, you should not
point the ball to center field ever.
That doesn't make sense.
And B your arm is actually not
at 90 degrees when your foot
strikes for the first time in your
delivery, your arm is actually.
In this position slightly above parallel.
It happens a little bit later
when it gets to the top.
So teaching this drill, the L drill
is a bad teach because it's a teaching
the wrong point in the delivery B
it's giving you a stop and go into
the wrong position and see it.
Doesn't teach you how
to get to that position.
And that is the really
critical point that's missed.
In that L pitching drill.
Okay.
The last pitching drill that
I really don't like for youth
baseball, for college baseball,
for pro whatever is the hook drill.
And I understand this drill.
I've used it for many years in the past.
We just found a better one that was
less awkward and less uncomfortable
and like easier to teach.
So the Hookem drill, you put your
back foot behind your leg and then
you point your knees slightly back.
You point your hip out.
And then you go and it teaches you
a couple of things, a how to point
your hip, which is a good thing.
B it forces you to break your hands
a little later, which makes your
arm action shorter and quicker.
And overall, those are both good things.
Hey buddy.
But it's just awkward.
It's hard to get, right.
And there's just a better drill for it.
So this is not a drill
that I would demonize.
If you do this drill with success.
Wonderful.
It makes a lot of sense for some
people, but again, it's just like
third down on my list of drills
that teach those same things.
So again, the Hookem
drill can be all right.
It's just not an ideal pitching drill.
It's kind of awkward,
kind of uncomfortable.
And I'm going to show you a better
variation that you can do in this video.
All right.
So we're into the section.
Let's cover some good pitching
drills that you're going to want
to swap for a lot of those other
ones, the ones that are outdated.
The ones that are a little
uncomfortable or awkward, let's
get to some good pitching drills.
All right.
First pitching drill that I
really like is the rocker drill.
And this is not the
short, quick rocker drill.
There's lots of different ways to do
the drop rocker drill, but this is how
I think the rocker drill should be.
Number one, hands are here.
Number two, you lean into
your front leg, pretty deep.
Number three, three,
your hands just break.
As you go back, you lean into
your back leg really deep.
So your front foot comes off the ground.
Your toe comes up.
And then from here, you initiate
with your glove arm and then you
go now, you don't do it in pieces.
Like I just demonstrated, but what
you do is do it all in one motion.
So in up, and then go, you
can keep your back foot down
or you can bring it back up.
It's up to you.
But in.
Up down.
And the reason is better way
to do it is because it teaches
you to use your front side.
It teaches you how to shift your weight.
It teaches you the proper sequence,
which is my glove side is going to be
the first thing that starts my delivery.
Those are all things that are
very important, much more than
just wiggling back and forth with
that sort of type of rocker drill.
Okay.
So this is a good pitching drill that I
really like, and this is to replace the.
Towel drill.
So this bottle is huge.
You don't need a bottle.
This big, you can get a bottle.
That's just like 16 ounces and you
want to fill it a little bit with
water and I have a full video.
I'll put the description or the
link in the description about
how to do water bottle drills.
Basically when you hold this water
ball in your hand, and now you go
through your pitching motion, the
water flows around and it feels much
more natural than a towel drill.
It's so much better and
it can also make your arm.
It's easy to feel where your arm
is in space because of where the
arm flows into the water bottle.
That's why you want to have less.
You want to have a less than filled.
So the water bottle is a much better
pitching drill than the towel drill.
All right.
The next drill that I
think is really good.
Pitching drill is the heel toe drill.
So this is going to replace the Hookem
drill and it teaches the hip lean.
It teaches having a faster handbrake and
a shorter arm action, all that stuff.
It's a really good drill.
So it's a lot more comfortable than the
hookworms drill because all I have to
do is put my foot out, point my toe up,
and then I'm going to push my hip out.
And then as I start to fall, I can go.
So it's so much more comfortable than
the Hookem drill where, and it does
pretty much all the exact same things
where I don't see any good reason to
stick with this one, which is awkward.
And this one.
Which is probably the most beloved
of the drills that I teach kids.
Think this is really smooth.
It feels really good.
And it's very similar to your mechanics.
It's basically just once we lift and come
back down, that's essentially the heel
toe drill position, which makes a lot
of sense because it's teaching a, a part
of the mechanics that are already there.
Right.
You're just sort of
breaking the mechanics down.
And you're starting from
like the middle portion.
So the heel toe drill is a
really great drill to integrate
into your throwing progression.
All right, the next drill.
And this is, I wouldn't call it as
much a pitching drill as I would
just a throwing drill, but it's
great to have in every kid's throwing
progression is just fast shuffles.
So the basics never go out of style.
So don't be afraid if this drill
doesn't look as like, you know,
shiny and complicated as it as many
others do, but your body works as
a system and to throw really well.
Your, your body has to work together, your
legs with your core, with your arms, with
your hand, with your wrists, all of it.
So when your body's moving fast,
everything sorta like jumps into place and
finds its rhythm within the whole machine.
So when you're moving fast and that's
shuffling, then you're everything
sort of gets together now like
running Crow, hops and all that stuff.
Those are also fine.
They're different there, but they're okay.
But I like shuffles because
you're in a good position.
You're close to your target and.
It helps prevent kids from flying open
as much when they're doing Crow hops,
they're more likely to Crow to fly open.
So this just looks like this.
It's very simple.
Start shuffled, move fast, and
then just pretty much let it eat.
So this is good at slower speeds.
If they, as long as they have
enough distance, it's also great
for longer speeds, longer distances,
but just have your kids on your
team, move their feet fast.
It's a great thing.
And again, Your body's not going to
have time to think through too much.
It's not going to have time to
stick your arm behind your body.
It's not going to have all this time
to do weird, bad biomechanical things.
When your feet are moving fast, your
arm, action's going to be short.
It's going to be quick.
It's going to be to the point.
So fast shuffles or great pitching drill.
All right.
So one of the great pitching drills
that you can do, uh, from a short
distance is called the lawnmower drill.
And this one is much
better than a wrist flips.
It's much better than this silly L drill.
And it has a specific purpose.
And that purpose is to help
players get comfortable with this
90 degree or less joint angle.
That's so important.
And also to help them pull their
shoulder blades back more if they
need that fix and their mechanics.
So the lawnmower drill, you're
going to put your feet close to
your, or a square to your target.
You're going to start here.
And this looks like, well, Dan, you
were just demonizing this position
earlier, but it's very different.
So.
I'm setting my angle here early, but
then I'm moving my arm into position
and I'm throwing without stopping.
So I'm going be here a year.
So I'm teaching my arm to get
comfortable getting into that position.
But when I get to that, high-speed part
of the motion where my arm is going to
get flung back into external rotation.
At that point, it's all go and
I'm not stopping and pausing at
a high-speed spot in my delivery.
So the lawnmower drill is great because.
It's helping me get comfortable,
getting into the position that
we want in our mechanics, rather
than just starting us there.
And then going from zero to 60,
which just does not work very well.
The next drill that's really
good for shorter distances.
It's also good for
teaching off-speed stuff.
So curve balls sliders is the
square hipster, and this is just a
progression from the lawnmower drill.
And here, you're going to
start with your hands together.
Your feet are going to be squared
of your target, your knees and hips.
You're going to rotate
with your upper body only.
So my lower half is not going
to move, and this is going to
isolate this half of my body.
So now I can focus more on my arm action
and my hand position as I go through
the actual delivery of the pitch.
So when I'm teaching kids how to spin a
curve ball, we'll start with the square
hipster and we'll have a move through it
so they can work on hand position, work
on, spinning it without their lower half.
Getting involved, which
can make it a lot harder.
So when you get the entire machine going,
it's a lot harder to get your hand into
the proper position to throw a curve ball.
But when we can isolate the lower half
and just work on the other half, that's
going to make a lot more progress in a
shorter time, teaching them good finger,
position, risk position, all that stuff.
The other thing is when I keep my
lower body fixed to my target, I'm
helping to get comfortable separating
my lower half from my upper half.
So, I want to be very diligent,
keeping my hips forward.
So as I turn my chest, there's now a
way, but my hips are still in my target.
That's the shoulder hip
separation that you need to be
a really high level pitcher.
And so this drill helps to
get you comfortable with that
and teach that flexibility as
sort of like a warm up drill.
This is like a 40 foot drill max,
but it's great for players to do when
they're just starting to get loose.
Cause again, it works on lots of
different aspects of their mechanics.
All right.
Well, I hope this video on proper
pitching mechanics and the best pitching

YOUTH PITCHING DRILLS: WHAT TO USE, WHAT TO AVOID  
(Simple guide for Little League players, parents, and coaches)

I. BAD DRILLS TO AVOID

A. Quick Rocker Drill  
- Too fast, sloppy, and unrealistic.  
- Doesn't teach timing, rhythm, or balance.

B. Elbow “Connection Ball” Drill  
- Involves squeezing a ball in arm angle.  
- Feels awkward and most kids hate it.  
- May teach elbow position, but disrupts natural throwing feel.

C. Towel Drill  
- Replaces ball with towel to simulate arm path.  
- Promotes bad habits (low elbow, push motion).  
- Hand and arm feel completely different from real throwing.

D. Wrist Flip Drill  
- Teaches wrist spin with elbow propped.  
- Completely unrealistic arm position.  
- Doesn’t help with actual spin or real throwing movement.

E. Finish Drill  
- Starts from end of the motion.  
- Ignores speed, sequencing, and timing.  
- Teaches players to “push” the ball instead of throwing naturally.

F. L Drill (Throw from a frozen 90° arm slot)  
- Teaches an isolated arm angle but not how to get there.  
- Not how real throwing works—timing and rhythm missing.

G. Hookem Drill  
- Leg wrap drill that teaches hip and arm timing.  
- Good ideas behind it, but awkward and hard to repeat for kids.  
- Better alternatives available.

II. GOOD DRILLS TO USE

1. Rocker Drill (Proper Version)  
- Stand tall, lean into front leg, then transfer back to back leg.  
- Hands break naturally, front side starts motion.  
- Builds rhythm, sequencing, and glove-side control.

2. Water Bottle Drill  
- Hold partially-filled bottle like a ball.  
- Throw with normal motion—feel water move.  
- Helps feel arm path and timing better than towel drill.

3. Heel-Toe Drill  
- Back foot heel lines up with front foot toe.  
- Push hip out, fall forward, and throw.  
- Teaches balance, hip action, fast arm break, and short arm path.  
- Feels natural and repeatable.

4. Fast Shuffles  
- Quick footwork, throw on the move.  
- Helps arm sync with legs and body.  
- Encourages natural rhythm and prevents “thinking too much.”

5. Lawnmower Drill  
- Start with arm in ready position; throw smoothly without pausing.  
- Builds comfort in throwing from ideal arm position with real timing.  
- Doesn’t freeze the motion like bad drills do.

6. Square Hipster Drill  
- Keep hips square, rotate upper body only.  
- Helps teach arm path, spin for off-speed pitches, and shoulder-hip separation.  
- Great for warm-ups and early-season arm patterning.

III. HOW TO USE THESE DRILLS

- Pick 1–2 drills per practice or bullpen session.  
- Always connect the drill to one real part of your pitching motion.  
- Avoid drills that feel too weird or different from actual throwing.  
- Teach drills that improve rhythm, balance, hip drive, and timing.

IV. FINAL TIPS

1. Good drills feel like real pitching—just slowed down or isolated.  
2. Bad drills feel awkward, stiff, or disconnected from a full throw.  
3. If it doesn't make sense to the player, it probably isn’t working.  
4. Focus on drills that build habits—don’t just “try things” without purpose.

COMPLETE YOUTH PITCHING GUIDE  
(Clear, high-detail reference for first-year pitchers and adaptable across age groups)

I. PITCHING PHASES: BALANCE → POWER → FINISH

A. BALANCE (Pre-Motion)
- Start tall, feet shoulder-width apart.
- Hands centered at chest or stomach.
- Avoid stepping behind or swaying—stay still and balanced over the rubber.
- Goal: Set up rhythm, posture, and control before any movement.

B. POWER (Drive Phase)
- Lift leg to waist-height (“cereal bowl height”) with foot dangling.
- Push back hip toward plate as leg descends (hip lead).
- Land stride foot flat or heel-first—not on toes.
- Keep shoulders level or slightly uphill; don’t lean forward early.
- Arm up at foot strike: upper arm level or slightly above shoulder, ball facing away from target.

C. FINISH (Rotation and Recovery)
- Glove tucks inside chest, not pulled wide.
- Chest and chin finish forward over lead leg (“flat back”).
- Arm follows through past opposite ribs.
- Finish balanced, not upright.

II. ZONE STRATEGY: COUNT-BASED LOCATION TARGETING

A. MARGIN FOR ERROR (Key Concept)
- Aim center when strike is essential (maximum forgiveness if you miss).
- As you get ahead, move your target outward—halves → thirds → corners.
- Do not aim for corners early—misses become balls.

B. PLATE TARGET SYSTEM

1. MIDDLE ZONE (High Margin)
- Use on: 0-0, 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 3-1
- Goal: Get a strike, reset count.
- Pitch: Fastball—your most controlled pitch.

2. HALVES (Moderate Margin)
- Use on: 1-1, 2-2, 3-2
- Goal: Stay competitive; choose inside or outside.
- Pitch: Fastball, Changeup, or Breaking ball with intent.

3. THIRDS (Low Margin)
- Use on: 0-1, 1-2
- Goal: Induce weak contact; avoid middle of plate.
- Pitch: Inside FB, low CH, edge-breaking ball.

4. CORNERS / ELEVATE / BOUNCE (No Margin)
- Use only on: 0-2
- Goal: Get strikeout or swing-and-miss.
- Pitch: Elevated FB, breaking ball in dirt, fading changeup.
- Miss on purpose if needed—still safe in count.

III. COUNT PLAN SUMMARY

COUNT       | LOCATION TARGET    | INTENT
------------|---------------------|----------------------------
0-0         | Middle              | Get ahead
1-0, 2-0     | Middle              | Regain count
1-1, 2-2     | Half                | Stay even or take lead
0-1, 1-2     | Third               | Force bad contact
0-2          | Corner / Bounce     | Swing-and-miss or chase

IV. PITCH SELECTION BY COUNT

- Behind in Count: Use best strike-pitch (usually fastball).
- Even Count: Mix FB and secondary for location, not trickery.
- Ahead: Introduce off-speed to disrupt timing.
- 0-2: Go for deception—show strike, end ball.

V. GOALS FOR YOUTH STARTERS

- Get outs in 3 pitches or less.
- Prioritize weak contact over strikeouts.
- Finish 5–7 innings using under 100 pitches.
- Don’t fear contact—induce early swings on well-placed pitches.

VI. PITCHER-THINKING VS. HITTER-THINKING

PITCHERS:
- Want hitters swinging early.
- Use count advantage to move off the center.
- Force hitters into defensive swings when ahead.

HITTERS:
- Selective when ahead (2-0, 3-1)—won’t chase.
- Expand zone when behind (0-2, 1-2)—will swing at borderline stuff.

VII. DRILLS: WHAT TO USE, WHAT TO AVOID

A. DRILLS TO AVOID
1. Quick Rocker – No rhythm, poor purpose.
2. Elbow Ball/Connection – Feels unnatural, disrupts arm path.
3. Towel Drill – Poor arm path feedback, promotes pushing.
4. Wrist Flips – Unrealistic arm motion; no actual spin benefit.
5. Finish Drill – Starts from unnatural position; kills kinetic sequence.
6. L Drill – Stops and holds a mid-motion position; teaches nothing about *how* to get there.
7. Hookem Drill – Teaches hip and arm timing, but overly awkward and hard to repeat.

B. EFFECTIVE DRILLS TO USE

1. Rocker Drill (Proper Form)
- Shift forward, then back deep to rear leg.
- Break hands naturally and start delivery from loaded position.
- Promotes rhythm, balance, and glove-side control.

2. Water Bottle Drill
- Use a half-filled water bottle instead of ball.
- Teaches clean arm path, improves tempo and spatial awareness.

3. Heel-Toe Drill
- Front foot heel and back foot toe offset.
- Push hip out and fall into stride.
- Improves posture, timing, short arm path, and hip load.

4. Fast Shuffles
- Move feet quickly and throw in rhythm.
- Encourages natural sequencing; helps arm sync with body.

5. Lawnmower Drill
- Start in “loaded” arm position, but throw without pausing.
- Reinforces proper elbow angle without freezing the throw.

6. Square Hipster Drill
- Hips stay square; chest rotates.
- Trains shoulder-hip separation and isolates hand/spin work.
- Ideal for early season or off-speed training at short distance.

VIII. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- Use 1–2 drills per session focused on 1 key fix (e.g. balance, hip lead, glove tuck).  
- Teach plate zones visually—middle, halves, thirds, corners—and match to counts.  
- Run 5-minute pitch calling review before bullpens:  
  - Assign target zone by count.  
  - Choose pitch type by comfort level.  
  - Rehearse miss locations (intended misses).  

IX. COACHING COMMANDMENTS

1. Teach by movement, not position.  
2. Never freeze the fastest part of the delivery.  
3. Prioritize repeatable mechanics over tricks.  
4. Let the pitcher feel good throwing—ditch awkward drills.  
5. Every pitch must have purpose: location, speed, or effect.  
6. Don't teach "aiming"—teach committed direction and intent.  
7. Use early strikes to gain control of ABs—everything builds from 0-0.
