Create two simple diagrams of the home plate area on a 46/60 Little League field (46 ft mound, 60 ft bases). Use kid-friendly objects to represent each important space.

Diagram 1 (Top-Down View):
- Home plate and strike zone: draw home plate, and above it place a cereal box outline to show the 3D strike zone (about 17 in wide, 17 in deep, height from knees to armpits of a 52–54 in tall child).
- Batter’s boxes: show two doormats, one on each side of the plate, each 6 ft by 3 ft, 4 in away from the plate.
- Catcher’s box: behind home plate, draw a big pizza slice (wedge) pointing at the plate, about 9 ft deep and 13 ft wide at the back.
- Umpire’s space: inside the catcher’s pizza slice, shade the back half to show the umpire standing behind the catcher like a buddy.
- Pitcher’s mound: 46 ft directly in front of home plate, draw a small circle with a tiny rubber bar on top.

Diagram 2 (Side View):
- Show the strike zone as a standing cereal box directly above the plate, with its top at the batter’s armpits and bottom at the knees.
- Show the batter standing on his doormat (either left or right side).
- Show the catcher crouched in the front half of the pizza slice, close behind the batter’s box.
- Show the umpire standing in the back half of the wedge, directly behind the catcher.
- Show the pitcher 46 ft away on a small mound, aiming through the cereal box.

Label all shapes with both their real baseball names (batter’s box, catcher’s box, strike zone) and their kid-friendly names (doormat, pizza slice, cereal box). Use bright colors and bold outlines so each sector is clear and easy for a child to recognize.

Create two simple diagrams of the home plate area on a 46/60 Little League field (46 ft mound, 60 ft bases). Focus on correct size, proportion, and orientation. Present the layout as if drawn on graph paper or as a technical blueprint. Perimeter shapes and labeled dimensions are most important; artistic style and colors are not necessary.

Diagram 1 (Top-Down View):
- Home plate: draw the standard 17 in wide plate (8.5 in sides, 12 in to the point).
- Strike zone: draw a rectangular prism directly above home plate. It must align perfectly with the plate footprint. Base: 17 in wide × 17 in deep. Height: from the hollow of the knee to midpoint between armpits and pants top, approx. 24 in for a 52–54 in tall child.
- Batter’s boxes: draw two rectangles, each 6 ft long (front-to-back) × 3 ft wide (side-to-side). The inside edge of each box is exactly 4 in from the edge of home plate. Boxes are oriented parallel to the foul lines, not tilted.
- Catcher’s box: draw a trapezoid with its point meeting the back tip of home plate. Extend the foul lines 9 ft behind the plate, then connect the endpoints with a straight line. This creates a wedge-shaped box pointing at the plate. Orientation must be precise: point at plate, wide edge behind.
- Umpire’s space: shade or cross-hatch the back half of the catcher’s box trapezoid. This shows the umpire standing directly behind the catcher, not to the side.
- Pitcher’s mound: draw a small circle centered 46 ft from the back point of home plate along the plate-to-second-base line. Place a rectangle for the pitcher’s rubber inside the circle. The rubber is 24 in long × 6 in wide. The mound is raised 6 in above plate level.

Diagram 2 (Side View):
- Show the strike zone as a rectangular prism standing directly above the plate, aligned vertically. Base: 17 in × 17 in. Height: approx. 24 in tall, from knees to armpits of a 52–54 in tall child.
- Batter: draw a simple figure standing on either the left or right batter’s box rectangle (doormat analogy). Emphasize correct stance distance from plate (entire feet inside the 3 × 6 ft box).
- Catcher: draw a crouched figure within the front half of the catcher’s trapezoid (pizza slice analogy), close behind the batter’s box and snug to the plate.
- Umpire: draw a standing figure directly behind the catcher, within the back half of the trapezoid. Both catcher and umpire share the wedge, stacked front to back.
- Pitcher: show a figure on the mound 46 ft away, throwing toward the strike zone box.

Label all shapes with their baseball names (batter’s box, catcher’s box, strike zone, pitcher’s mound, pitcher’s rubber, umpire’s space). Also note the kid-friendly analogies in parentheses (doormat, pizza slice, cereal box). Accuracy of placement and orientation takes priority over style.

Generate a simple reference image that shows a collection of 3D primitives arranged in a grid so that each shape has roughly the same amount of space. Include the following primitives:

- Cube
- Rectangular box
- Plane (flat quad)
- Sphere
- Capsule
- Cylinder
- Cone
- Pyramid (wedge)
- Torus (ring)
- Prism (triangular prism)
- Ellipsoid (stretched sphere)
- Dome (half-sphere)
- Disc (flat circle)

Arrange them neatly in rows or columns, all scaled to be visually comparable, with clear separation so each shape is distinct. Use neutral gray shading and simple outlines so the geometry is easy to see. Label each primitive with its name underneath. Do not add any thematic context or background details — only the primitives.
