Find any unreal engine 5.4 entries from Unreal’s official documentation that would be relevant to creating a forward-scrolling infinite-swimming game that takes place entirely underwater. I want information of Blueprints and C++ programming, configuring, setting up, settings, etc. I do not want assets.

To create a forward-scrolling, infinite-swimming game set underwater using Unreal Engine 5.4, you can follow these steps, covering both Blueprints and C++ programming:

Setting Up Character and Movement

Creating a Character Blueprint:

Start by setting up a custom Character class. This can be done by creating a new Blueprint from the Character parent class.

Configure the Character's movement component to support swimming by setting the MovementMode to Swimming. This can be done in both Blueprints and C++.

Implement basic movement logic by handling input actions for moving forward and backward, turning, and looking around. For example, in C++ you would bind these actions in the SetupPlayerInputComponent method
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Creating and Setting Up Player Controller:

Create a PlayerController Blueprint or C++ class to handle player inputs. This controller will translate player inputs into character movement.

Define input mappings for actions such as swimming forward, turning, and any other controls specific to your game
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Environment and Navigation

Creating an Underwater Environment:

Utilize the underwater post-process volume settings to create an underwater effect. Adjust settings like fog density, color grading, and caustics to simulate an underwater environment
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Use a combination of static meshes, materials, and particle effects to create underwater scenery and obstacles.

Custom Navigation and AI:

Implement custom navigation areas and query filters to define how AI characters navigate the underwater environment. This can be useful if you have AI-controlled creatures or obstacles that need to move realistically in water
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Animation and Physics

Animation Blueprints:

Use Animation Blueprints to manage the character's swimming animations. Blend different animations based on the character's movement speed and direction
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Implement state machines within the Animation Blueprint to handle transitions between different swimming states, such as idle, fast swim, and turning.

Physics Settings:

Adjust the physics settings for your character to simulate buoyancy and water resistance. This can involve tweaking the character's collision properties and physics material to ensure realistic movement
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Additional Features

Configuring Blueprint Components:

Use Blueprints to create interactive elements such as currents or bubbles that affect the player's movement.

Implement visual scripting for game mechanics like collecting items, avoiding obstacles, or interacting with other underwater creatures
docs.unrealengine.com
.

C++ Enhancements:

For more complex behaviors and performance optimizations, use C++. For instance, you might want to handle custom collision detection or optimize the movement system by overriding default methods in the Character or MovementComponent classes.

Resources

Unreal Engine documentation provides detailed guides on setting up characters, player controllers, navigation, and animation Blueprints. Refer to these sections for specific code snippets and Blueprint configurations

Here is a summarized and quantized version of the resources to help you set up a forward-scrolling infinite-swimming game in Unreal Engine 5.4:

1. Character and Movement Setup

Character Blueprint:

Create a Character Class: Use Blueprints or C++ to set up a custom Character class.

Movement Component: Configure to support swimming by setting the MovementMode to Swimming.

Input Handling: Bind actions for moving forward, backward, turning, and looking around. In C++, use the SetupPlayerInputComponent method to bind these actions.

Example: C++ code snippet for binding movement input:

cpp
Copy code
void APlayerCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent) {
    Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
    PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveForward", this, &APlayerCharacter::MoveForward);
    PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveRight", this, &APlayerCharacter::MoveRight);
}


Player Controller:

Create Player Controller: Use Blueprint or C++ to handle player inputs.

Input Mappings: Define input mappings for swimming actions.

Example: Blueprint setup for a custom PlayerController
docs.unrealengine.com
docs.unrealengine.com
.

2. Environment and Navigation

Underwater Environment:

Post-Process Volume Settings: Adjust fog density, color grading, and caustics.

Environment Assets: Use static meshes, materials, and particle effects for underwater scenery
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Custom Navigation:

Navigation Areas and Query Filters: Create custom navigation areas and filters to influence AI navigation in water.

Example:

Create custom Area Classes.

Set up Navigation Query Filters in Blueprint
docs.unrealengine.com
.

3. Animation and Physics

Animation Blueprints:

Animation Management: Use Animation Blueprints to manage swimming animations.

State Machines: Implement state machines for different swimming states.

Example: Setting up Animation Blueprints to blend animations based on movement speed and direction
docs.unrealengine.com
.

Physics Settings:

Buoyancy and Resistance: Adjust physics settings to simulate underwater buoyancy and resistance.

Example: Configure collision properties and physics material
docs.unrealengine.com
.

4. Additional Features

Blueprint Components:

Interactive Elements: Create interactive underwater elements such as currents and bubbles.

Visual Scripting: Use Blueprints for game mechanics like item collection and obstacle interaction
docs.unrealengine.com
.

C++ Enhancements:

Custom Behaviors: Implement complex behaviors and optimizations using C++.

Collision Detection: Handle custom collision detection and optimize movement systems by overriding methods in Character or MovementComponent classes
docs.unrealengine.com
.
