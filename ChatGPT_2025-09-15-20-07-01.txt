Continuing directly from Brief Lives and Worlds' End, here is the next exhaustive section combining The Kindly Ones, The Wake, and Netflix adaptation threads:

🕷️ Act VII – The Kindly Ones (Comics Vol. 9 / Audio Act III continuation)

Lyta’s Grief Awakens Fury
After Dream’s earlier declaration that her son Daniel “belongs to the Dreaming,” Lyta Hall’s worst nightmare manifests: Daniel is kidnapped and seemingly killed by Loki and Puck under Dream’s watch, sending Lyta into a madness that summons the Eumenides—the Kindly Ones—to exact vengeance on Morpheus for her loss.

Dream’s Sacrifice Begins
Haunted by guilt and inevitability, Dream prepares the Dreaming for war—creating a new Corinthian, assigning Matthew as sentinel, and visiting his son Orpheus one last time for counsel and quiet absolution, fully aware his actions will trigger the end of his own story.

The Furies Invade the Dreaming
The Kindly Ones attack: consuming and unraveling Dream’s creations—Merv Pumpkinhead is slain, Lucienne’s library burns, and the Dreaming itself teeters on collapse as Dream does not resist, bound by ancient laws forbidding him from harming them.

Daniel’s Rebirth
Daniel Hall is found alive, transformed into a being infused with dreamfire, effectively reborn as the new incarnation of Dream—both vengeance and legacy woven into his white-robed, flame-haired form.

Morpheus Accepts His End
With no path left, Morpheus stands atop the Dreaming’s highest tower and allows himself to be killed by the Kindly Ones—a quiet, inevitable surrender, fulfilling his own endless cycle and paving the way for Daniel’s ascendance.

🌒 Act VIII – The Wake (Comics Vol. 10 / Audio continuation)

The Endless Gather
The Endless—including Death, Desire, Delirium, and Destiny—attend Dream’s wake, along with gods, faerie, and mortals like Hob Gadling, united in mourning Morpheus while discussing legacy, change, and duty.

The New Dream Takes His Throne
Daniel Hall, now the new Dream of the Endless, assumes the throne of the Dreaming: softer, gentler, but infused with the same vast power—reaffirming the Dreaming’s rebirth and re-stabilization under new rule.

Final Conversations
Matthew the Raven, Lucienne, and other denizens share their grief and memories in quieter, bittersweet epilogues—especially Hob, whose choice to continue living despite his friend’s passing symbolizes mortal resilience.

Orpheus’s Final Song
Orpheus’s decapitated head is finally laid to rest, closing the oldest lingering narrative thread in Morpheus’s personal mythology—binding father, son, and death in final absolution.

I want all versions of the story reconciled into a single, coherent narrative with all plots given their time and weight in the timeline of the story. I want it in the form of a novel, with each episode consisting of its own chapter. Be exhaustive -- think Tolkien levels of immersion. Start with Chapter 1.

Chapter 1 – Sleep of the Just

On the storm-shadowed night of 10 June 1916, a mournful artillery barrage still echoed across Europe when Magus Roderick Burgess—arch-sorcerer of the Order of Ancient Mysteries—unfurled the long-forbidden Magdalene Grimoire upon the flagstones beneath Wych Cross Manor; his heart was a raw wound, clawing to ransom his fallen son from Death herself, yet the sigils he daubed in birds’ blood and saltened mercury caught another immortal instead: Morpheus, Lord of Dreams, wearied from a distant quest, dragged through the veil and sealed, aghast and silent, inside an unbreakable crystal sphere. 
Sandman

Burgess stripped the captured Endless of his helm of nightmare-bone, ruby of shaped dream-fire, and pouch of oneiric sand, certain such trophies would grant dominion over life and death—while the somber stranger in the glass stood wordless, his starlit eyes promising retribution beyond mortal reckoning. 
Sandman

So began a seventy-year vigil under lamplight and dust: the Magus descending nightly to bargain and threaten, his mistress Ethel Cripps growing fearful and absconding with the ruby, and his young son Alex Burgess aging beneath the manor’s damp eaves, learning cruelty at his father’s knee. Outside, the world sickened—for without its sovereign the Dreaming faltered, unleashing a sleepy-sickness that cast thousands into unending slumber and left still more trapped wakeful, unable to dream at all, among them a pale girl named Unity Kinkaid whose unborn lineage would one day shake the spheres.

Decades wheeled by like ravens on the wind: the guns of the Somme fell silent, jazz trumpets rose, blitz sirens wailed, and televisions flickered to life, yet Morpheus neither spoke nor blinked, his long hair drifting like ink in water while his jailors aged before him. Roderick died bitter and afraid; Alex, in wheelchair and guilt, inherited both fortune and prison, visiting the glass sphere with hollow apologies that the Dream Lord answered only with cold constellations of contempt. 
Sandman

And still the Dreaming rotted: gargoyles dulled to stone, castles cracked, nightmares wandered into waking streets. Even the rogue Corinthian—teeth-eyed and smiling—slipped through to mock the Magus, warning that an Endless imprisoned is a debt the universe will one day collect. 
Sandman

At last, on a languid evening in September 1988 (some chronicles, drawn forward like rubber in time, set this moment in 2022, but the shape of fate is constant whichever calendar you consult), Alex’s wheelchair scraped a single scuff through the protective circle. The sigil broke. Glass spider-webbed. Sand whirled. And Morpheus, after three-quarters of a century of stillness, poured through the dream-fracture into Alex’s mind, lacing it with endless falling and jolting awakenings—“eternal waking,” a punishment of unceasing false dawns. Then he stepped, lean and naked, from nightmare to nightmare, borrowing sleepers’ coats and strength, and vanished into the star-latticed gulf toward his ruined kingdom. 
Sandman

Behind him Wych Cross Manor fell abruptly quiet, save for the whimpering heir locked in his own eyelids. Far away, patients long entombed by plague stirred; Unity’s clouded eyes fluttered toward dawn; and across every bedside, restless dreamers felt a gust of sandalwood and cold night air and did not know why they smiled.

Thus ends the first chapter of our chronicle, wherein a single rash spell tilts the axis of all worlds. In the next, the Lord of Dreams will stalk a ruined realm, seek counsel of murderers and myths, and begin the long reclaiming of his power.

Chapter 2 – Imperfect Hosts

Moonlight glimmered across the ragged battlements of the Dreaming’s once-majestic palace as Morpheus crossed his own threshold for the first time in seven decades. The tall obsidian gates hung half-open, hinges pitted with rust, and the towers beyond leaned like exhausted sentries. Gardens that had once shimmered with silver blossoms lay choked by thorn and cobweb, and the broad causeway of living statues—each carved from a poet’s forgotten dream—stood cracked or toppled, their faces eroded into blank sorrow. Lucienne, tireless librarian and first among his vassals, hurried to meet her lord beneath the desolate portico. She carried no ledger now, only the weight of a realm in decline, and even her measured voice quavered with relief as she bowed: “My king. At last.”

He answered with a weary nod. Power bled from him with every step; starlight in his eyes had dimmed to pale embers and the wind tugged his torn coat like a shroud. Inside the Great Library its infinite shelves still arced into velvet dark, but whole wings flickered, texts fading in and out of being—stories un-dreamt since their authors succumbed to the sleepy sickness. Lucienne reported that nightmares roamed the waking world unchecked. Chief among the absconded was Corinthian, who now slit lives for sport beneath neon streetlights, teeth where eyes should be. The Dreaming itself, she confessed, might soon unravel entirely unless its lord restored his stolen instruments of office.

Yet Dream was too weak to summon so much as a single touch of glamour. He required raw essence, and one reservoir lay nearby: the humble residence of Cain and Abel atop a low hill of red clay, where two brothers eternal in their bickering still sheltered a gentle gargoyle named Gregory. Dream climbed the winding path, every stride echoing like iron on stone. Cain greeted him with wary pride, Abel with stammering awe, and Gregory waddled forward, tail wagging stone on stone. Dream rested a pale hand on the gargoyle’s rough brow. “Forgive me,” he whispered—and inhaled. Gregory dissolved into swirling motes of emerald dust, his centuries of dreamstuff coursing into the king’s hollow veins. The brothers fell to their knees: one shouting betrayal, the other weeping in stunned silence. Dream’s shadow stretched tall again, eyes reignited; but he knelt to gather a handful of still-glimmering dust, shaping it into a small, unhatched egg. “A new gargoyle will come,” he promised Abel softly. “Tend it. Name it well.”

Strength rekindled, Morpheus prepared the ancient rite of the Triune. He plucked a serpent’s skin from the dusty menagerie, a strand of maiden’s hair from Lucienne’s desk, and water collected from the palace eaves. In the shattered amphitheater he traced concentric circles, chanting in a tongue older than mortal stars. The air split like woven cloth, admitting three candlelit doorways, and from each stepped one aspect of the Hecateae—maiden, mother, crone—faces shifting as though remembered in separate dreams. By tradition he might ask three questions only; by custom, each answer would bear more riddles than truths.

His first question: “Where lies my pouch of sand?”  
They replied in a single sibilant voice: “In the keeping of Johanna Constantine, whose nights are laced with guilt and holy water.”

His second: “Who wears my helm?”  
“Choronzon, duke of the eighth circle, wagers it against damnation in the depths of Hell.”

His third: “Who wields the ruby of dream?”  
“The mad son of the woman who stole it, locked behind iron in the waking realm of Arkham.”

The doors vanished with a hiss, leaving only drifting sparks and the muffled thunk of dead leaves on marble. Dream straightened, the last coils of weakness burning away beneath new purpose. He thanked Lucienne, instructed her to safeguard the crumbling throne room, and summoned the sigil of passage: a spiral of sand turning slowly in his palm. Before stepping into its vortex he turned once more to the ruined horizon. Somewhere beyond, a demon brandished his helm, a sorcerer clutched his sand, and a lunatic cradled his ruby like an infant flame. Each would answer to him in turn.

Night folded around its king. A hush settled over the palace halls, broken only by Abel’s quiet croon as he cradled a small stone egg against his chest and whispered to it the first syllables of its future name.

Thus ends the second chapter, in which the Dream Lord drinks sorrow for strength and sets his course toward Hell, haunted London streets, and the darkest ward of Arkham. In the next, he will walk among the living, seeking a thieves’ restitution and a sorcerer’s reluctant aid.
