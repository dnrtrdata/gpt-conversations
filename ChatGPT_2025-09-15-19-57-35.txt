The following represents formats of data from a br25 disc copy of a ps3 game. Can you help me understand the formats?

Download: SHA1 • MD5 • SFV • KEY

Copy code
i. SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
   - Purpose: Verifies data integrity using a 160-bit (40-character) hash.
   - Use Case: Confirm that a file has not been modified or corrupted.
   - Common Tool: `sha1sum` on Linux, `CertUtil` on Windows.

ii. MD5 (Message Digest 5)
   - Purpose: Another hash function that produces a 128-bit (32-character) hash.
   - Use Case: Similar to SHA1, but weaker; often used for fast but less secure file integrity checks.
   - Common Tool: `md5sum` on Linux, `CertUtil` on Windows.

iii. SFV (Simple File Verification)
   - Purpose: Contains CRC32 checksums for multiple files, typically in a plain-text format.
   - Use Case: Verifies all files in a set, especially useful in large or multi-part archives.
   - Common Tool: `QuickSFV`, `WinSFV`, or command-line tools.

iv. KEY (Decryption Key / RAP File)
   - Purpose: For PS3 games, often refers to a license or decryption key (e.g., .RAP or .EDAT key).
   - Use Case: Required to decrypt or run encrypted game files with emulators (e.g., RPCS3) or backup managers.
   - Common Tool: `PS3 Dump Checker`, `RPCS3`, `Rif2Rap` for .RAP creation.



Would you like help identifying which tool to use to validate or extract these files for a specific game?
