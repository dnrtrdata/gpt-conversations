Your task will be to combine all glossary sources I provide you as a single storytelling/filmmaking/game-designing term-glossary you must edit to remove redundancy. If questions regarding which identical, similar, or otherwise-redundant terms should be kept (and which should be removed) arise, prioritize written storytelling in general (and that term's value to it), then filmmaking, then fame-designing. The idea is to synthesize EVERY SINGLE RESPECTIVE TERM within EVERY SINGLE RESPECTIVE SOURCE into A SINGLE GLOSSARY that combines ALL OF THE STORYTELLING/FILMMAKING/GAME-DESIGNING KNOWLEDGE of all sources into A SINGLE GLOSSARY that any example of any one of these respective mediums/formats can use as a shared language to compare and contrast them against any other respective examples in any other respective medium/format. This needs to be a large task and not omit a single idea that any of the respective terms in any of the respective sources have listed. Do you understand?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Yes, I understand your instruction clearly. To summarize and confirm:

You’ll provide multiple glossary sources covering storytelling, filmmaking, and game design.

My job is to combine all terms from all sources into a single, unified glossary.

I’ll remove redundancy:

If two or more terms mean the same or overlap heavily, I’ll consolidate them.

If two terms overlap but serve distinct purposes in writing, filmmaking, or game design, I’ll clarify that in the entry or prioritize according to your hierarchy:

Written storytelling first

Filmmaking second

Game design third

I must preserve every idea found in any glossary provided — nothing gets left out just because it seems niche.

The final glossary is intended to work as a shared language across formats, allowing clear comparisons and cross-medium conversations.

Please upload or paste your first glossary source when ready. Let me know if you'd like me to show the structure I’d use for entries — for example:

Primary Medium Relevance:

Or would you prefer a different format?

User:


I want a format that minimizes/quantizes definitions into a single concise sentence.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Understood—so the goal is:

One sentence per term, no fluff, no stacked paragraphs.

Concise, precise, unified phrasing across all terms.

When combining redundant or overlapping terms, distill them into the clearest single-sentence version possible.

No repeating entries—each concept shows up once, even if it has relevance to all three mediums.

When you’re ready, go ahead and send the first glossary source, and I’ll begin building the combined, quantized master list as we go.
