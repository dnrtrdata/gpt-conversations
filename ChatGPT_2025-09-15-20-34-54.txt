Explain as specifically as possible, using as much context as possible (from both this transcript and search) what the 4 tempers referenced in Severance:

<pre style="caret-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">Severance is packed with hidden meanings

but few are as mysterious or as

unsettling as Kier eagan's four tempers

woe Frolic dread and Malice aren't just

abstract philosophies they're the

foundation of everything at Lumen

industries from the Eerie rituals in the

perpetuity Wing the waffle party and

more recently the revelations at wo's

Hollow to the cryptic number sorting in

macro data

very fabric of lumen control but what if

they're more than just corporate

Doctrine what if the four tempers are a

blueprint one that Lumen is using to

engineer human

personalities with season 2 expanding on

the Cold Harbor project and the dark

history of wo's hollow it's time to dive

deep into the origins symbolism and

chilling implications of the four

tempers are Lumen employees unknowingly

part of a psychological experiment and

is kier's ultimate goal even more

terrifying than we imagine let's break

it all down to fully understand the four

tempers one must analyze their

historical Roots their role within Lumen

and the unsettling parallels to

realworld psychological and corporate

control theories Kier Egan the Mythic

founder of lumen believed that every

person's soul was composed of four

emotional forces woe Frolic dread and

Malice each representing a different

fundamental Human Experience according

to Kier the balance of these tempers

determined a person's character and

without proper discipline they would

spiral into chaos Egan's writings

particularly those found in the fourth

appendix reinforc the idea that these

temperaments must be rig iously

controlled subdued and if necessary

purged to achieve Len's ideal version of

The Human Condition this philosophy

underpins everything from Severance

itself to the work being conducted

within macro data refinement MDR where

numbers are sorted based on emotional

responses that seemingly align with the

four tempers Woe Is The Temper linked to

sadness grief and Melancholy in kier's

symbolic framework woe is represented by

the gaunt bride a pale diminutive woman

clad in a wedding dress this figure

embodies mourning and sorrow reflecting

the emotional weight of loss the

location wo's Hollow is named after the

site where Kier allegedly encountered

woe as a child his story in the fourth

appendix suggests that he confront Ed

woe after the death of his twin brother

deer Egan who was supposedly transformed

into the woods around

him kier's allegory links woe to

personal loss and guilt making it an

emotion that must be subdued to move

forward the gaunt bride whispered that

deer's death was his fault tying kier's

loss to desire shame and guilt this

interaction marked the beginning of

kier's spiritual Conquest over the four

tempers each temper presented as an

external entity tested cure in different

ways he had to overcome Frolic which was

framed as Reckless Indulgence dread

which paralyzed him with fear and Malice

which threatened to consume him with

rage the process of taming them was

depicted as both a literal battle and a

symbolic

transformation Frolic represents Joy

playfulness

and frivolity kier's depiction of Frolic

as a smiling gesture suggests that

excessive Indulgence in pleasure leads

to

foolishness the character Dylan embodies

Frolic early in Severance often making

jokes seeking out perks and reving in

the small Joys available to Lumen

employees however as Dylan experiences

trauma particularly during the overtime

contingency protocol he begins to shift

away from Frolic displaying rage and

determination instead dread encompasses

fear anxiety and

apprehension this temper is symbolized

by an old Crone whose terrified

expression represents dreads paralyzing

grip the archetype of the Crone often

aligns with wisdom but kier's depiction

suggests that dread stems from a fear of

Aging change and the unknown

Irving the most rule abiding MDR

employee embodies dread as he

consistently follows protocols and

expresses fear over potential

punishments his in Persona is deeply

anxious about failure which contrasts

with his Audi's rebellious investigation

of lumen Secrets malice embodies anger

hostility and harmful intent represented

by a ram malice appears to be the most

dangerous of the four tempers kier's

choice of a ram as malice's symbol is

curious possibly tying into the

mysterious goats seen in lum's

operations heli r with her aggressive

Defiance and self-destructive Tendencies

embodies malice her introduction to

Lumen is marked by immediate Rebellion

attempts at self harm and outright

hatred toward her Audi this unbridled

rage disrupts the MDR our team's

equilibrium making heli a key figure in

the resistance against Lumen kier's

philosophy suggests that the ideal

person eliminates the dominance of any

single temper achieving a harmonious

equilibrium however lum's true motives

for enforcing this balance remain

sinisterly ambiguous a major visual

representation of the four tempers in

Severance is the painting Kier taming

the four tempers the artwork portrays

Kier flogging four figures each

embodying one of the tempers reinforcing

the notion that suffering leads to

Enlightenment and

self-control the severance procedure

itself can be seen as an extension of

this ideology artificially segmenting a

person's emotional states and

experiences if Kier truly believed that

unrestrained emotion led to chaos then

the ability to literally separate one's

mind into controlled States would be the

ultimate realization of his

philosophy this is why mdrs macro data

refinement process involves categorizing

numbers based on emotional intuition

employees unknowingly participate in

refining human personalities possibly to

engineer a perfected balance of the four

tempers one of the most compelling

theories circulating among sance fans is

that macro data refinements work

directly manipulates severed employees

to achieve a perfect balance of the four

tempers this could explain the cryptic

Cold Harbor project which seems to

involve modifying personality traits

through Severance the four tempers

closely align with historical theories

of personality and temperament

particularly the four humors black bile

melancholic yellow bile ceric fleem

fmatic and blood sanguin these ancient

medical theories posited that an

individual's mental and physical health

depended on the balance of these humors

in Severance the MDR employees seemingly

embody these tempers Mark represents woe

with his melancholic nature Irving

displays dread through his nervous

adherence to Len's

rules Dylan exemplifies frolic until his

disillusionment and heli manifests

malice through her rebellious Fury one

Theory suggests that Lumen is actively

attempting to manipulate and refine

these temperaments aiming for an ideal

psychological ratio this aligns with the

number sorting tasks of MDR where

employees categorize data clusters based

on the feelings they elicit the

categories wo green FC yellow Dr red and

Ma blue seem to correspond to the four

tempers Mark's remark about numbers

appearing scary suggest that these

classifications may be tied to emotional

conditioning if MDR sorting process

Alters these data sets in real time they

may be modifying severed employees at a

subconscious level molding their

personalities to fit an unknown agenda

another theory posits that the severance

project aims to create an optimized

human personality filtering out

undesirable traits this could be linked

to Kier Egan's vision of human

Perfection the idea that numbers

represent aspects of human personality

suggests a process akin to psychological

engineering if the Cold Harbor file is

as some suspect tied to gemma's

reintegration it could indicate that

Lumen is using Severance to edit

individual ual into kier's ideal form

Additionally the waffle party ritual

raises questions about kier's personal

struggles some speculate that the four

tempers might symbolize an internal

battle potentially linked to kier's own

repression the presence of a male dancer

in the waffle party's performance and

the enforced secrecy surrounding the

ritual hint at the possibility that

kier's philosophy was in part a means of

controlling and suppressing his own

desires if taming the tempers is a

metaphor for internal struggles it may

suggest that Lumen indoctrination

extends Beyond mere corporate loyalty

into personal and psychological

Conformity moreover the selection

process for severed employees seems to

favor individuals with unresolved trauma

or personal turmoil Mark grieving his

wife's death seeks an escape from pain

pety endured a painful divorce and

estrangement from his daughter Irving's

past suggests military service and

potential family estrangement possibly

linked to his repressed

sexuality Dylan's backstory remains

largely unknown but his Fierce reaction

to seeing his son implies a deeper

emotional wound heli meanwhile exhibits

unyielding animosity toward Lumen

suggesting an unknown but deeply

personal reason for her presence these

patterns indicate that Lumen

deliberately recruits individuals with a

high degree of internal conflict

reinforcing the theory that the four

tempers are being manipulated in real

time Kier Egan four tempers aren't just

a philosophical framework they are a

means of manipulating and controlling

human identity whether through

behavioral modification selective memory

engineering or outright cloning lum's

goal appears to be the artificial

creation of the perfect severed

individual devoid of rebellion or

imbalance the deeper question remains

what is Lumen refining is it merely a

social experiment in corporate loyalty

or is the company attempting to engineer

an entire population based on kier's

utopian

ideals as severant season 2 continu to

unveil the Cold Harbor mystery the real

purpose of MDR and the fate of Miss

Casey the true extent of lum's Ambitions

and their terrifying

implications will finally come to light

one thing is certain Kier Egan didn't

just want to tame the four tempers he

wanted to rewrite what it meant to be

human what do you think the four tempers

really represent are they just a

corporate ideology or is human shaping

In the television series "Severance," the enigmatic philosophy of Lumon Industries' founder, Kier Eagan, revolves around the concept of the "Four Tempers": Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice. Eagan postulated that every human soul comprises these four emotional forces, and achieving a harmonious balance among them is essential for personal equilibrium. This ideology permeates Lumon's corporate culture and practices, influencing everything from employee rituals to the mysterious tasks performed within the company.

These Four Tempers are not merely abstract concepts within the series; they are intricately woven into Lumon's operations and the employees' experiences. For instance, the Macrodata Refinement (MDR) department's task of sorting numbers is believed to correspond to these tempers, with employees categorizing data clusters based on the emotions they elicit. This process may serve as a method for Lumon to monitor and manipulate the emotional states of its workforce, aligning with Kier Eagan's philosophy of temperance and control.

Screen Rant

Furthermore, the series draws parallels between the Four Tempers and historical theories of personality, such as the four humors: melancholic (black bile), sanguine (blood), phlegmatic (phlegm), and choleric (yellow bile). Each humor was thought to influence both physical health and personality traits, much like the tempers in Eagan's doctrine. This alignment suggests that Lumon's practices may be an attempt to engineer or refine human personalities to achieve an ideal balance, as envisioned by their founder.

inly the principes seem to mirror the

nine fruits of the Holy Spirit found in

operates almost like a religious cult

with Kier positioned as its deity this

comparison further strengthens the idea

that lummen is not just a corporate

In the television series "Severance," Lumon Industries operates under the guidance of nine core principles established by its founder, Kier Eagan. These principles are deeply ingrained in the company's culture and serve to unify its workforce, shaping employees into what Lumon considers ideal workers. The principles are:

Vision: Encourages foresight and the ability to plan for the future, aligning personal goals with the company's mission.

Verve: Promotes enthusiasm and vigor in one's work, reflecting a passionate commitment to duties.

Wit: Emphasizes sharpness and intelligence, encouraging employees to think critically and adapt to challenges.

Cheer: Advocates maintaining a positive and uplifting attitude, fostering a pleasant work environment.

Humility: Stresses modesty and the recognition of one's limitations, promoting teamwork and collective success over individual accolades.

Benevolence: Encourages kindness and a willingness to help others, reinforcing a supportive community within the company.

Nimbleness: Highlights agility and the ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, ensuring efficiency and resilience.

Probity: Upholds integrity and strong moral principles, ensuring honesty and ethical behavior in all actions.

Wiles: Suggests the use of clever strategies and cunning when necessary, allowing for resourcefulness in achieving objectives.

These principles are not merely corporate jargon but are treated with near-religious reverence within Lumon. Employees are expected to internalize and embody these values, often reciting them regularly to reinforce their commitment. For instance, Helena Eagan reveals that she recites the nine principles every night before bed, indicating the immense importance placed on them by the Eagan family and their expectation of absolute adherence to these values.

The integration of these principles into daily routines serves as a method of indoctrination, aligning employees' identities closely with the company's ethos. This practice ensures that personal desires are subordinated to corporate objectives, fostering a unified and controlled workforce. The principles' overlap with the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit found in the Bible's Galatians hints that Lumon operates almost like a religious cult, with Kier positioned as its deity.

The nine principles are prominently displayed within the company premises and even in employees' personal spaces, serving as constant reminders of the behavioral standards expected. For example, Harmony Cobel's home features numerous reminders of these principles, emphasizing her deep devotion to Kier Eagan's teachings.

In essence, Lumon's nine core principles function as both a moral compass and a mechanism of control, ensuring that employees embody traits that align with the company's overarching goals. By instilling these values, Lumon seeks to create a workforce that is not only efficient and compliant but also deeply connected to the company's identity and mission.

In the television series "Severance," Lumon Industries intricately weaves the doctrines of the Nine Principles and the Four Tempers into its corporate culture, reflecting founder Kier Eagan's vision of an idealized human condition. These frameworks serve not only as guiding philosophies but also as mechanisms of control, shaping employees' identities and behaviors to align with Lumon's objectives.

The Nine Principles

Kier Eagan's Nine Principles are foundational to Lumon's ethos, prescribing the virtues that employees are expected to embody:

Vision: Encourages foresight and alignment with the company's mission.

Verve: Promotes enthusiasm and vigor in one's work.

Wit: Emphasizes sharpness and adaptability.

Cheer: Advocates maintaining a positive attitude.

Humility: Stresses modesty and teamwork.

Benevolence: Encourages kindness and support within the community.

Nimbleness: Highlights agility in adapting to change.

Probity: Upholds integrity and ethical behavior.

Wiles: Suggests cleverness and resourcefulness in achieving goals.

These principles are deeply ingrained in Lumon's operations, often recited by employees and displayed prominently within the company's premises, reinforcing a culture of conformity and devotion.

The Four Tempers

Complementing the Nine Principles, the Four Tempers—Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice—represent the fundamental emotional forces that Kier Eagan believed constitute the human soul:

Woe: Embodies sadness and melancholy.

Frolic: Represents joy and playfulness.

Dread: Encompasses fear and anxiety.

Malice: Signifies anger and hostility.

Lumon's corporate culture emphasizes the suppression and control of these tempers to maintain order and productivity. This is evident in the company's rituals and the symbolic representations found throughout its facilities.

Interrelation and Implementation

The integration of the Nine Principles and the Four Tempers serves as a comprehensive system to mold employee behavior:

Behavioral Conditioning: Employees are encouraged to embody the Nine Principles, aligning their actions with Lumon's ideals. Simultaneously, they are trained to suppress the Four Tempers, mitigating emotions that could disrupt productivity.

Rituals and Symbols: Lumon's environment is rich with symbolism reinforcing these doctrines. For instance, the Waffle Party ritual involves participants wearing masks representing the Four Tempers, highlighting the company's focus on controlling these emotional forces.
Wikipedia

Work Tasks: Departments like Macrodata Refinement (MDR) engage in tasks that metaphorically reflect the management of the Four Tempers, such as sorting data clusters based on the emotions they elicit, reinforcing the internalization of Lumon's control over emotional expression.

Impact on Employees

The dual application of the Nine Principles and the Four Tempers profoundly affects employees:

Identity Suppression: By dictating virtuous behavior and suppressing natural emotions, Lumon effectively diminishes individual identity, fostering a uniform workforce.

Psychological Control: The constant reinforcement of these doctrines serves as a method of psychological control, ensuring employees remain compliant and aligned with corporate goals.

Cult-like Environment: The reverence for Kier Eagan's teachings and the ritualistic practices contribute to a cult-like atmosphere, where deviation from prescribed norms is discouraged.

In essence, Lumon Industries employs the Nine Principles and the Four Tempers as tools to engineer a controlled and efficient workforce, reflecting Kier Eagan's vision of human perfection. This intricate system underscores the show's exploration of corporate overreach and the manipulation of individual autonomy.

Severance has always been a reflection
on the state of a modern world,

and what it means to be human
in a capitalistic, modern society.

There are quite a few video
essays and pieces about this already,

but given the new revelations
we were shown, I wanted to delve a bit

more into the philosophy behind Kier,
Lumon, the severance procedure

and how that relates to deeper, wider
themes that the show is exploring.

First,
I think it's important to start with what

Kier Eagan’s beliefs actually are.

Bear with me here, because I do think
understanding this elucidates

what Lumon is trying to do
but more importantly, why

they are trying to do it.

Although Lumon and the Eagan

family’s beliefs seem to draw inspiration
from multiple religions and cults,

there is an aspect of it
that is decidedly Biblical in nature.

While it is possible
that the goats are just a running gag

that the writers committed to
due to the sheer absurdity,

Personally,
I think that they might symbolize

something significant
at the heart of Kier’s beliefs.

Note that I'm going to talk about
the following

as a non-religious person myself,
but I will do my best

to explain everything
based on my research on the topic.

There is a well known ritual and story
described in the Bible that involves

a pair of goats, and it is also the origin
of our modern word “scapegoat.”

Quoting the first line
from the Wikipedia page: “In the Bible,

a scapegoat is one of a pair of kid goats
that is released into the wilderness,

taking with it all sins and impurities,
while the other is sacrificed.”

While there are multiple versions
of this story and ritual,

depending on the translation
and specific faith,

each version involves drawing lots
to decide the fate of the two goats.

Ultimately, one of them is chosen
to symbolically carry away

the sins of the community.

Regardless of the details,
the important part of this story

seems to be the idea of placing
all your sins and impurities onto an “Other,”

whether that's a goat,
a person, or a part of yourself,

and severing it from the community
(or yourself).

An interesting footnote to this section
harkens back to the original break room

from season one, which heavily evoked
themes of repentance and confession.

The lines that the innies 
were made to recite

sound almost like a religious mantra.

Forgive me for the harm I have 
caused this world,

None may atone for my actions but me,

and only in me 
shall their stain live on.

I am thankful to have been caught,

my fall cut short by
those with wizened hands.

All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am.

In the original Hebrew Biblical texts,

the goat sacrifice
ceremony is done by a high priest

who lays a hand on the scapegoat
and recites the following:

While doing my research,
I was struck by how similar in tone

the break room lines
felt to the Biblical lines above.

Personally I believe
that the tale of a scapegoat

struck a deep chord with Kier
Eagan, and is perhaps the seed of inspiration

for developing his own beliefs
about the world and about humanity.

From what we know so

far, his idea of enlightenment
seems to revolve around

a kind of purification, or rather,
compartmentalization, of the self.

The story we heard during
the ORTBO is significant

in understanding this.

Personally, I don't think Kier ever
had a twin brother.

His twin was probably a side of himself
that he was ashamed of,

a side that indulged in, in his opinion
at least, sin and lust.

Instead of working through his own
complicated emotions and internal conflict

and reconciling that part of him
with his whole self identity,

Kier chose to cast out that part of him
completely.

He murdered his twin in the forest,
and with him what he believed

to be the tainted parts of himself
that he was ashamed of.

It was a symbolic purification ritual.

While at the time he did this symbolically,

I believe the idea
at the heart of severance is a direct

result of this belief.

Perhaps older believers
ascribed to the idea that through mental

willpower, asceticism, and self repression,

it's possible to reach Kier’s idea
of enlightenment on your own,

to be able to completely cut off
all parts of yourself

that experience shameful
or negative emotions.

However, as we get to the modern day,
I think more contemporary followers of his

realized a way to reach this enlightenment
through the use of technology.

What if they could invent a way
to circumvent the long and imperfect

process
of refining yourself through mental,

behavioural, and emotional control?

What if they could find a way
to literally sever the self into many selves,

each one perfectly calibrated
to bear the multitude of sins, suffering,

and imperfections that would taint a
pure and holy life and self?

I believe,

especially from the deluge of information
we were given from the latest episode,

that this is what Lumon
is trying to accomplish.

And this is also what
Lumon is trying to sell to the world.

The idea of enlightenment,
a way to live a perfect life,

become a perfect self free
not just from the most painful of life's

suffering, but from even the most
minor inconveniences or negative emotions

In Kier’s philosophy,

this would be the ultimate utopia.

Kier was wrong though.
His vision is not one that leads to utopia

or enlightenment,
but to the most extreme kind

of dehumanization
and sterilization of the self.

Which leads to the next part:

What would life be like
if we followed Kier’s logic

and the goals of the severance chip
to their natural conclusion?

Among many things,
Severance reflects on identity

and the multitude of selves
that one contains. The premise of the show

is already a play on how many people
naturally become different versions

of themselves in different environments,
such as the person we are

when we're around friends and the version
we are at a workplace.

To a large extent, this fluidity of
identity is a normal part of being human,

as we adapt to different norms
and needs of the contexts that we are in.

However, there are other,
more harmful ways this manifests,

harmful to ourselves, and harmful
to others.

I'll address the former first.

There are many situations
where we are forced to

metaphorically sever ourselves
in our day to day lives

in an act of self-dehumanization,

whether it's due to self repression,
shame, survival, or trauma.

Although there are quite
a few examples of this in the show,

one example
I really want to focus on is Seth Milchick.

The scene where Milchick receives
those awful blackface paintings of Kier

and is expected to smile and be grateful,
is exceptionally powerful.

It is the first time that the show
explicitly acknowledges

Milchick’s place
in this predominantly white company,

and how he has had to mold himself
into a specific kind of person to thrive.

Him being reprimanded
for using complicated words is a direct

nod to how people of colour in reality
are often criticized

for over intellectualizing
and forced to “dumb themselves

down” for the comfort
and preconceived notions of white people.

You must eradicate from your essence
childish folly.

You must eradicate from yourself
childish folly.

You must abandon childish things.

You must grow up.

You must

grow up.

Grow up.

Grow up.

Grow up.

Grow.

Grow.

Grow.

Grow.

Grow.

Milchick speaking to himself in the mirror,

and harshly severing
away the parts of himself that use

these eloquent words,
is a painfully realistic representation

of the way many people of colour
in real life are forced to split off

certain parts of themselves
piece by piece to fit a preconceived mold.

In a similar vein
to how Kier might have felt it to be

a virtuous act
to cast off the sinful parts of himself,

Milchick is being expected to cast off
the “less desirable”

parts of him, at least in the eyes
of his white supervisors.

And this act isn't seen as demeaning
or self repressing in Lumon’s eyes,

it’s seen as a kind of necessary
self refinement.

There are so many examples in real life
of marginalized people and communities

being forced to compromise parts
of themselves to survive, repressing parts

of their identity out of internalized
shame or fear or out of real danger.

People, particularly minorities, often
have extensive experience

changing the way we speak, dress, behave,
and hold ourselves

based on where we are
or the people we are around.

We have to become different versions
of ourselves based on the situation

we're in, and adapt for survival
and safety.

Without the space
to reconcile or reintegrate

all of these selves and embrace yourself
wholeheartedly,

there is a real danger of losing yourself
entirely in the process.

Which makes

me ask the question:
if Lumon has a monopoly

on these severance chips
and the ability to calibrate them at will,

what kind of characteristics or emotions
or experiences would they deem as positive

and pure, and what kind would they deem
as negative or dirty?

Similarly to how online
algorithms unconsciously shape who we are

and how they can often enable,
if not downright encourage,

discriminatory beliefs and harmful status quos,

Kier’s technologically enabled 
“utopia” has wider implications,

not only for an individual's
own happiness,

but for what society regards as desirable

or undesirable in human beings.

The way we can sever ourselves
into different versions of ourselves

can also manifest in ways
that result in great harm to other people.

There is another quite
chilling implication to the severance

procedure that we saw
from the conversation with Burt

during that extremely awkward dinner.

The idea that one can sever
a version of themselves to go to heaven

while another version of themselves
is condemned to hell.

I sometimes find myself asking myself,

how is it
that people can commit atrocities,

utterly inhumane and cruel acts, yet

still be able to go home to their family
and live perfectly ordinary lives?

One aspect of it absolutely relates

back to the ability of people
to dehumanize other people.

But another aspect of it,

I believe, comes back to the compartmentalization 
of the self.

In reality, people do this
internally, psychologically,

but in Severance one can do this
quite literally.

People are sometimes able to do horrible,
inhumane things

by severing their own accountability
and responsibility in the matter.

In real life,
that can sound something like that

“ I was just following orders,”
or “I was just doing my job.”

The man who goes home to his family
after committing war crimes

kisses his child
goodnight without a second thought,

because this version of him
is a good father,

a respectable husband.
He can face his children,

he can treat himself to a luxurious meal,

he can watch TV with his legs up,

because of a terrifying ability
for people to compartmentalize away

and excuse the parts of themselves
capable of committing

great harm to others.
Though of course this is just one

amongst many reasons why people are able
to do horrible things to each other.

But I have to ask: what happens
if people are given

an even easier shortcut
to compartmentalize themselves?

What Lumon is offering is also a way

for people
to completely sever their own conscience,

and their responsibility
to treat other people well.

The Burt that was speaking was already fully
convinced that he was going to hell.

And honestly,
he didn't seem all that bothered by it.

He already believed
that he'd created a version of himself

that would be allowed to go to heaven,

because that version of him
had nothing to do with

whatever atrocities
this version of him committed.

So what exactly is stopping this Burt

from continuing to commit atrocities?

After all, he is already condemned.

In his eyes, there is
seemingly no reason for him to stop.

After all, this is the version of him
that's meant to be the “bad one,”

that's meant to do all the bad things

that the other versions of him
don't have to live with.

And if he feels any guilt or regret, or

if he feels any doubt
or second guesses himself,

he can simply just sever away
that part of him that feels regret

or guilt
and continue to do whatever he was doing.

Forgive me

for the harm that I have caused this world.

None my atone for my actions

but me.

And only

in me

shall their stain live on.

All I can be is sorry,

and that is all I am.

A huge part of becoming a better person

is confronting and learning
from the parts of yourself that hold

harmful beliefs
or are capable of doing harm to others.

The ability to compartmentalize
your responsibility over those parts away,

or to partition them into a version of you
that you don't need to feel

accountability over, is a guaranteed way

for you to never be able to grow past them.

People are malleable
and become different versions

of themselves in different contexts
and different environments. To be clear,

I don't believe that the fluidity of human
identity is an inherently bad thing.

We all contain multitudes,
and that can be a source of great strength

and depth, as well as a source of harm
and repression.

It is the forceful compartmentalization
and quantification

of this complex aspect of being human
that I question here.

We don't reach enlightenment or happiness

through avoidance, compartmentalization,
or repression.

We grow through challenging ourselves,
allowing ourselves

the space to feel whatever emotions
we may feel, good or bad,

through facing our fears
and our pain as well

as taking accountability for our actions

and being mindful of our place
in the world and our connection to others.

On face value, the idea of being able

to skip past unpleasant
parts of life might be tempting.

After all, everyone has had that
thought some time or another.

You're bored at work and glancing
at a clock that doesn't seem to move.

You're anxious at the dentist,

and every minute in the waiting room
feels like an hour.

You're scrawling out the 50th Christmas
thank you card, and you're tired

and your hand hurts, and each word
seems to take an eternity to write.

I keep thinking back to the initial idea
that started the show.

Dan was working at a job
he hated at a door factory,

and found himself wishing he could just
skip ahead the long, tedious eight hours

and wake back up again
on his way out of work.

And he wasn't
the only one who felt that way.

The idea unsettled him, though.

The time we have in the world is so finite
and short in the grand scheme of things.

Yet not only is it possible
that one would be okay

with removing so much time
from their life,

but one might want to
do so willingly and happily.

Severance takes that idea to the extreme.

Not just severing your work self,
but severing every part of yourself

that might experience negative emotion,

which forces us as an audience
to reflect on

what it actually means
to live a fulfilling and happy life.

Would we really necessarily
be happy or enlightened

if we were simply able to buy a product
or a procedure that allows us to remove

everything we find inconvenient,
uncomfortable or unpleasant?

By the way, I'm going to ignore the wider

implications, especially what
this would mean for the innies,

just for the sake of simplicity right now.

But I will get to that in a bit.

I think the resounding answer
to all those questions,

is no, we wouldn't be happy.

I'm not sure we would even be human,

not in the way that we
all know and understand it.

On a slight tangent

here, you can actually reminds me
a little bit of Bryan Johnson.

To those who don't know who he is,
he's a real person

an exceptionally wealthy tech
entrepreneur and venture capitalist

who is completely and utterly obsessed
with life extension and immortality.

To achieve this, he attempts to perfectly
optimize every aspect of his life,

not allowing anything he deems
even potentially harmful or negative.

Every moment of his life is outsourced
to a team of doctors

who analyze data about his body
and self to create

a suffocatingly strict regimen to optimize
his health.

He's reduced himself to nothing
but a machine

to be refined and optimized to perfection.

To quote an article about him, Johnson
thinks of any act

that accelerates
aging like eating a cookie

or getting less than eight hours of sleep
as an act of violence.

Outsouring

the management of his body means defeating
what Johnson calls his rascal mind

the part of us that wants to eat ice cream
after dinner or have sex at 1 a.m,

or drink beer with friends.

Every single day of his life,
is reduced down to a treatment,

an exercise or ritual meant
to slow his aging and optimize his health.

But the question we have to ask ourselves
is, Is Bryan Johnson happy?

In my

mind,
if Kier Eagan existed in the modern day,

he would probably be a Silicon Valley
billionaire

so utterly obsessed
with the idea of perfect

optimization of every aspect of life
and self that he would lose

any semblance of a meaningful life
or self in that pursuit.

Although Bryan
Johnson's case is a bit different,

I think in a way we can draw parallels
between the way

him and many extremely wealthy
people like him think about the world

and the way Kier Eagan did.

Sure, you can surgically remove anything
that is potentially negative

from your life,

whether through an ultra strict
health routine or a chip in your head.

But the question is,
what else are you removing

along with it?

Whether we like it or not,

life isn't a lump of earth
we can refine away

until we remove all impurities to arrive

at some fantastical, perfect compound
or chemical.

Life is messy, complicated,
full of inconveniences and discomforts.

Everyone is imperfect.

We all have our own fears, comfort zones,
likes, dislikes, things

we find joy from, and things we find mind
numbingly tedious

and boring.
We make mistakes. We face our fears.

We challenge ourselves,
and we grow as humans from a multitude

of experiences,
not all of which are euphoric or perfect.

Some of our happiest and most meaningful
memories are imperfect or complicated,

or a result of obstacles and challenges
we had to face along the way.

It is not difficult to surmise that

under whatever metrics Lumon assigns
to the severance chips, many,

if not most, of these important moments
would be severed away.

I’m actually reminded
a bit of a line from the movie

Everything Everywhere All at Once.

It is a deeply moving line
that has stuck with me ever since.

It expresses
so beautifully the joy and meaning

that can be found
even in the smallest moments,

that there is wonder everywhere,
and how we can often lose sight of that

in a deluge of distraction and discontent.

Something like laundry or taxes
can be mundane, boring and tedious.

But like we see in the glimpses of Mark
and Gemma doing

dishes together in their flashback,
they can also be beautiful.

However, it is utterly inconceivable

that Lumon’s optimization
algorithm recognizes this.

In the perfect future they offer,
there will never be

just a simple moment of doing laundry
or taxes with someone you love.

Of course,
there are some truly terrible things

we go through in life that we wish
we could sever ourselves from.

Terrible
injustices happen in the world, and

while there is joy,
there is also tremendous suffering.

I'll delve more into this
in the next section as well.

However, the nature of life
is that while we can absolutely strive

and should strive to make the world
a happier place, we can't hope to bargain

with life and operate on it
like a surgeon removing a tumor

on an operating table.

If you reject all the negatives,

you'll necessarily
also reject the positives.

The good and the bad in life
aren't binary opposites of each other.

Rather, together they create something
greater than the sum of their parts.

I also have to

wonder if this procedure existed,

how people would end up treating
each other or understanding each other

Without subscribing to the sometimes
quite damaging refrain that one needs

to suffer to be a kind person,
which I don't necessarily think is true,

I do think that experiencing

the spectrum of human emotion and various
experiences, whether good and bad,

helps us
build sympathy and empathy towards others.

While we can't always understand perfectly
what other people are going through,

the rich and endless well of human
experiences and possibility of experiences

that we all have in our lives
helps us connect with each other.

And I can't help but think that

if the severance procedure existed,
it would only serve

to dehumanize and disconnect society
even more.

It's kind of cliche at this point
to say that happiness is meaningless

without unhappiness as a metric
to compare it to. At times

this refrain is absolutely dismissive
and misses the point entirely.

But it is true that negative emotions
are important and a fundamental part

of being human, and that emotions
themselves are in fact relative.

Without ever feeling
fear, sadness, or anger,

could we really grasp of significance
of emotions like joy, relief, or love?

Imagine something as simple

as a person
having a dream of becoming an artist.

The path forward isn't easy.

It's full of hard
work, long nights and setbacks.

According to Kier, the solution to
this is to sever yourself

so that “you”
don't have to experience any of that.

Now, another version of you or many
versions can endure all of that for you.

Another version of you is experiencing
fatigue and boredom.

Spending hundreds of hours
practicing drawing shapes, learning

perspective,
improving various techniques and skills.

Another version of you is experiencing
frustration,

tearing off pages of a sketchbook
because there's just one aspect

you can't seem to get right.

Yet another version of you is awake
at night,

disheartened and discouraged
as they reflect on

why they want to do this at all.

Finally, at the end of all the toil and
countless severed versions of you later,

“you” are at the opening
night of your gallery exhibition.

Before you are all the paintings
you have done,

each one unique and profound.

However, you look around at all of them
and what you feel isn't joy

a sense of achievement, pride, or love,

what you feel is barely anything.

You don't feel much
connected to them at all.

You know that
technically you did all of this.

Each art piece is meaningful,

but to which version of you
is it meaningful?

The version of you that gets to experience
success, or the version of you

that toiled away at the hours of practice
and improvement

as your skills got better
and better over time?

The version of you that gets to bask
in the achievement in the end

or the version of you
that was considering giving up

in moments of despair,
only to make the choice to carry on?

I don’t believe that intense suffering
is necessary for art,

or that artists must suffer
for the sake of their creations.

I do believe that we should always
try to minimize the suffering of others,

and to try and create a world
that is just, kind, and joyful.

However, I do believe that
the spectrum of human emotion

is fundamental to the human experience,
that it is impossible to categorize

certain emotions or experiences
as strictly positive or negative.

Without this nuance or depth,
we would lose something essential

to the human experience
and what makes living meaningful at all.

As a final thought for this section, I'm

weirdly reminded of the 2006
Adam Sandler movie Click.

If you haven't watched it,

The premise of it is that Adam
Sandler's character, Michael Newman,

finds a magical remote that allows him
to skip past parts of his life,

including inconveniences, illnesses,

arguments, and other unpleasantries.

While it seems like a godsend at first,

it inevitably ends in misery.

He skips ahead whole portions of his life,

only to realize that he missed out on time
with his children,

his wife, and his family dog
also passed away.

At one point, he's a wealthy CEO,
but he's surrounded by teenage children

who he never watched grow up,

who he doesn't have a good relationship
with, and a marriage that has fallen

apart.

Long story short, the remote tries
to save him from all the negatives,

but the ultimate result is that
he just misses out on his life entirely.

He didn't end up happy.

He ended up miserable.
In a similar vein,

If we follow Kier’s teachings
to their natural conclusion,

what we get isn't happiness.

What we get is the sterilization
of the self and of life,

a ship of Theseus where we sever away
so much that what we have left

is completely unrecognizable,
or even worse,

we’re left with nothing at all.

Sure, it's

easy to say you should take the good
with the bad in life,

but what about everyone who suffers
needlessly under injustice and oppression?

Your bad day is getting stuck in traffic
on the way

to work and spilling coffee
all over your desk.

But compared to a bad day of someone
living in abject poverty,

or in a war zone,

who are you to judge anyone's desire for
an easy reprieve from all the suffering?

That sentiment
would absolutely be justified.

However, the issue is that the solution
that Lumon is offering doesn't actually

solve anything or actually minimize
overall suffering in the slightest.

The severance chip
doesn't fundamentally address

any of the root causes of human
suffering at all.

It doesn't acknowledge societal
injustice, oppression, or inequality.

What it offers is a convenient shortcut
for people to be able to turn a blind eye

to all of it, at the cost of the endless
suffering of countless innies.

A bandaid

solution that placates those able
to undergo a procedure

that one company has a market monopoly on.

It is, of course, also completely fair
and understandable

for someone to want severance for solace
or reprieve

from a personal struggle
like grief, addiction or trauma.

In fact, the show clearly explores
the deeper reasons why people might agree

to it, as grief is what drove
Mark to the procedure in the first place.

Not a desire
to skip out on the tedium of work.

What Severance also clearly shows
is that this isn't a solution.

Even without the severance
chip, compartmentalizing

and ignoring pain
or trauma is not a way to heal from it.

The real solution is a compassionate
support system

that allows people to face
and process their pain.

And only then can someone heal and grow.

And even if the severance

process is perfect,
would Mark really be happy?

His innie might find some reprieve,
but at what cost?

He loses
all memory of Gemma and his love for her.

The grief of losing her is gone,
but the meaning of their relationship

together,
their love for each other, is also gone.

Like it never existed at all.

One version of him lives
this sterilized so-called happy life.

One who never had the chance to meet
Gemma, get to know her,

fall in love with her,
and spend years with her.

And one version is still left
with that loss,

returning home alone
to carry that grief and pain.

At the end of the day,

what Lumon offers isn’t healing.

It isn't closure.

It's the ability to condemn one version
of yourself to be a scapegoat for pain,

and another version of yourself
to have never experienced

the kind of love that resulted
in that pain of loss at all.

Which brings us to the wider
societal commentary.

What kind of world do we live in

and what is the nature of its problems,

that something like Lumon’s
utterly inhumane severance procedure

could ostensibly be
sold as a desirable solution?

In Ursula Le Guin's famous short story,

There exists a utopian city
where everything is perfect.

Everyone is happy and content with this 
Paradise they created for themselves.

There is, however,

one condition that allows it to exist.

One that every citizen of the city
is shown once they are old enough.

The condition is this:
For utopia to exist,

there must always be one innocent child
kept in abject misery and isolation,

tortured senselessly
out of sight of the rest of the citizens.

There is no specific logic to the city
or why this must be the case.

The short story is more a thought experiment
than a practical exploration.

The whole concept
that Ursula Le Guin was critiquing was

how much people are willing
to turn a blind eye to atrocity

and allow others
to suffer the sake of their own happiness.

She describes
how almost every citizen in the city,

when first discovering
the truth, is disgusted and horrified.

They aren't devoid of empathy.

They are meant to be ordinary people.

A person you would bump into on the street,
your neighbour, your friend,

even yourself.

And yet,
almost every one of them ultimately

compartmentalize
this very cognitive dissonance away,

not wanting to relinquish
this promise of happiness and comfort,

not wanting to disturb the peace
of this so-called utopian society.

They choose the path of least resistance.

They are horrified
by the suffering of the child,

and yet they come to normalize it
to themselves.

A really interesting note about this work

is that Ursula Le Guin
quite directly acknowledges

the idea of the scapegoat
as a central tenet of the story.

The story has an open ended but powerful
conclusion which the title references.

There are some people, a minority,

but some, who learn about the existence

of this child
and choose to walk away from utopia.

It is, after all, not a utopia

if it is built on the back of atrocity
and the suffering of others.

They chose to no longer be complicit
in a system

that so dehumanizes
another for their own happiness.

They are the ones who walk away
from Omelas.

Let's say that Lumon’s sales
pitch is correct.

If getting severed
would, in fact, deliver on the promise

of a perfectly happy life for you, free
from all the pains and inconveniences,

would it be worth it?

Would you willingly buy into that premise,
knowing that

countless versions of yourself

are doomed to suffer in their own
personal hells for their entire lives?

I think severance cuts right
to the deeply broken part of capitalism

that would say yes
without a second thought.

What Lumon is selling
is not much different from

what many corporations are selling today.

The idea that it is okay, desirable
even for others to suffer,

even if others
include versions of you yourself

just for the sake of your own
convenience, comfort and pleasure.

Lumen severance chip
is just a natural inevitability

in a society that so dehumanizes
each and every person.

Where people are reduced
to a means to an end,

from underpaid and mistreated workers
to prisoners forced into labor.

While it would

be ideal to live in a society
and within a system

that would naturally, immediately
reject what Lumon has to offer,

the one we live in now
won't just accept Lumon’s premise,

but profit endlessly from it.

The reality of capitalism
is that it dehumanizes people.

It needs to, to work.

It dehumanizes people to the point
where it is not at all farfetched

that people would even dehumanize
versions of themselves.

Lumon is just hoping to sell
that ultimate version of dehumanization

to the masses. And the uncomfortable truth
is that this already exists.

Just not as a sci fi brain chip.

We may see the state of Gemma's many

innies and feel horror and repulsion,

just as the citizens of Omelas
did at seeing the child.

And yet, almost all of us
live in a society and a system

where we are taught implicitly to be okay
with exploitation and injustice.

After all, who makes the clothes we wear?

Who builds the parts that our phones
and our laptops are made of?

Uber and DoorDash gig workers

work with no labour rights
and sometimes for atrocious pay,

just so we don't have to experience

the inconvenience of picking up food

or driving ourselves
or going on public transit.

Amazon workers are forced to endure
utterly inhumane working conditions

so people can save a few bucks
and get next day

shipping on a toothbrush or something.

Amazon, of course, makes mind boggling

profit year after year after year.

The demand is there because we are sold

the idea that all of this is okay
and normal from a very young age,

and even if the majority of us do feel
that it's not okay,

all companies have to do
is to keep people placated

or isolated enough from each other
to never have the power to challenge them.

So how different is this really,

from a promise of a severance ship
that cuts away different versions of you

so they can bear the weight of your
inconveniences, pains, and discomforts?

After all, you yourself
never have to face the discomfort

of directly facing
or acknowledging these innies,

and the innies themselves are isolated
in their own personal hellscape,

with no chance to interact with or connect

with other innies
in a similar position as themselves.

As long

as Lumon can normalize this reality enough
to placate the outies of their customers

who absolutely may be dealing
with their own pains

and grievances
that lead them to the procedure,

and as long as Lumon can keep
the innies

isolated enough so they are kept helpless

(I mean, think about
how all the different departments

on the severed floor
are discouraged from interacting.)

Lumon can make an absolute fortune
from their severance ships.

As a note here,
I am not ignoring the reality

that some people require services
like meal delivery or online shopping

due to disability, illness,
or other reasons.

However, similar
to what I mentioned about Mark

and how he's trying to deal
with his grief,

A solution like Lumon’s, or in

real life,
ramping up the gig economy even further,

is not the sustainable solution
to inaccessibility or systemic ableism.

Ultimately,
Lumon does not see the innies as people,

even though Severance
shows us again and again

that they absolutely are.

They experience emotions.

They fall in love. They have their own

likes, dislikes, personalities,
relationships, fears, desires.

They are human beings,

but in Lumon’s eyes, they aren't.

And they want to sell that idea
to all of their customers:

The innies aren't human.

They are there
to be a means to an end for you.

It is also a reflection on how so much
of the suffering on the world stems

from this dehumanization of ourselves
and of other people.

A small minority of extremely privileged
always get what they want,

while the vast majority
don't even get what they need.

Ultimately,
I don't think that the point of the show

is that this means we're all doomed
to spiral endlessly in a broken system

that perpetuates inequality and suffering.

The dehumanization of others
and complicity to atrocity

is not innate to human nature.

Remember what Petey’s card said
in the very first episode of the show?

I used to think it would take a monster
to put someone in a place like that office.

Especially if the person
was himself.

But we’re not monsters, Mark.

Not real ones.

While what Mark and

Petey did in severing themselves
may have been an ethically complicated

decision,
they are also not the root of evil.

Innie Petey may have initially believed
his outie to be a monster

for condemning him
to a lifetime in that basement,

but after reintegration, he understood
that the real monster is Lumon,

even if he himself, of course, still holds
some accountability for his choices.

The decision to sever
is a complicated one,

one that we can clearly see is sympathetic
in some cases,

like Mark, and less
so in other cases, such as the severed

innie created only to experience childbirth
and nothing else.

But even if we accept the premise
that everyone who severed themselves,

no matter the reason, committed
a monstrous act, their motivation

and ultimate choice to do so is also not
something that's innate to human beings.

It is

simply a reflection
of the values of the society we live in.

(Or the sci fi cult company that one works for)

what it sells us,
and what it teaches us to value.

It teaches people to value convenience
over human rights and personal comfort

apathy and complicity
over facing uncomfortable truths.

It teaches us that exploitation is okay,

desirable even, as long as it's profitable,

and as long as it's cleverly packaged
and branded under a different name.

But like the show suggests,

this is not all immutable or inevitable.

It can be questioned and changed.
We’re not doomed to be disconnected,

dehumanized, and disillusioned forever.

At the end of season one,

it is the collective action of the innies
that activated the overtime contingency

and struck the first blow
in Lumon’s seemingly impenetrable armour.

We’re not happy. We're miserable.

They tortured us down there,

we’re prisoners!

We as an audience can see that Lumon

is not all powerful
and not the sole arbiters of truth.

That there will always be people
who challenge the reality

they try to sell.
At the end of the day, of course,

Lumon also exists in a society
that allows it to exist,

and I don't think that is inevitable
either.

If we take Lumon to represent
not just a company, but a wider societal

system, we can see its shortcomings,
we can see its injustices,

and recognizing them
is the first step to challenging them.

There is a way to reduce human suffering,
to achieve a happier future,

even if we may never realize
a perfect utopian society.

The way isn't through anything
like what Kier or Lumon represents,

but through, as Severance hints at, ways

that are rooted in love,
connection, and and community.

At the end of the day, it is never too late

to walk away from Omelas.

In the television series "Severance," Lumon Industries' founder, Kier Eagan, established a guiding framework known as the "Four Tempers." This philosophy categorizes human emotions into four distinct types: Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice. Eagan believed that by understanding and balancing these tempers, individuals could achieve personal and professional harmony. This doctrine is deeply ingrained in Lumon's corporate culture, influencing employee behavior and the company's operational ethos.

The series also delves into complex themes of race and identity, particularly through the character of Seth Milchick. In Season 2, Episode 3, Milchick is presented with paintings depicting Kier Eagan as a Black man. This gesture, intended by the company to make Milchick feel included, instead comes across as a misguided attempt at diversity, reminiscent of blackface. The scene highlights the disconnect between Lumon's leadership and its employees, underscoring issues of superficial inclusivity and the challenges faced by employees of color within the corporate structure.

Major Unresolved Mysteries in Severance (Season 1) – Analysis and Likely Resolutions

Severance presents a labyrinth of unanswered questions, blending corporate dystopia with psychological mystery. Below, we dissect each major mystery from Season 1, outline prevailing theories (grounded in evidence rather than wild speculation), and evaluate the most plausible resolutions. We also compare Severance to other works of fiction where meaningful, evidence-backed parallels exist, highlighting at least three concrete connections in each case.

Lumon’s True Purpose and the Severance Experiment

The Mystery: What is Lumon Industries really doing with the severance procedure and its severed employees? The company’s public rationale is work-life balance, but the extremes of control and secrecy on the severed floor suggest a darker agenda. Employees can’t truly quit, their behaviors are micromanaged, and bizarre “wellness” sessions and punishments (like the Break Room) feel more like brainwashing than office perks
soapcentral.com
. Cobel (Harmony) hints to the Board about “reintegration” being possible (as with Petey), only to be rebuffed – implying the company hides more than it admits.

 

Prevailing Theories:

Mind Control Experiments: Many suspect Lumon is refining a form of mind control or behavior modification technology. The strict monitoring and conditioning of innies – from coded “wellness” sayings to the terrifying Break Room mantras – hint that severance is an experiment in reshaping human identity and obedience
soapcentral.com
soapcentral.com
.

Memory Harvesting or Data Mining: Another theory is that Lumon might be using employees’ brains to harvest data or memories for secret projects
soapcentral.com
. The fact that only severed individuals can perform certain tasks suggests the company is exploiting the unique state of innies for a larger goal.

Cultivating Wider Societal Control: Evidence from outside Lumon indicates a push to normalize severance in society. A state senator (Angelo Arteta) champions pro-severance legislation, and his own wife underwent a severance procedure to forget the pain of childbirth
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. This implies Lumon’s goal is expansion – applying memory division to motherhood, perhaps warfare, or other aspects of life, effectively extending corporate control into the personal sphere.

Evidence & Likely Resolution: The Eagan family (Lumon’s founders) treat severance as more than a business – it’s almost evangelical. Helena “Helly” Eagan’s participation (see below) was intended as a PR spectacle to sell the public on severance
people.com
. Lumon’s museum-like Perpetuity Wing, with Kier Eagan’s wax figure and holy quotes, underscores that the company’s purpose is quasi-religious: achieving Kier’s vision of “taming” human nature
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. In Kier’s own words, each person is composed of “four tempers” (Woe, Frolic, Dread, Malice), and “should you tame the tempers as I did mine, then the world shall become but your appendage”
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. This suggests Lumon’s ultimate goal is total control over human minds and emotions, first in the workplace and eventually in society at large. The likely resolution is that the severance chips and the bizarre workplace rituals are designed to let Lumon perfect behavioral control, creating human beings who conform exactly to the company’s (or Kier’s) ideal temperament
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. In essence, Lumon appears to be using its employees as test subjects to refine this technology – a conclusion supported by the company’s push for legal acceptance of severance and the evidence of severance being used outside Lumon (e.g. Gabby’s childbirth) to prove its “benefits”
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Season 1 stops short of confirming the full plan, but all signs point to a large-scale ambition: to expand severance and cement the Eagans’ power by reshaping human memory and identity. This aligns with the show’s central theme of personal autonomy versus corporate (or cultish) control.

The Meaning of Macrodata Refinement – What Are the Numbers?

The Mystery: Mark and his Macrodata Refinement (MDR) team spend their days sorting mysterious numbers on their computer screens into bins, based on an “emotional” instinct. They’re told nothing about what the data represents or why they must sort it. Even the refiners themselves continually ask, “What are we actually doing?” and get no answer
looper.com
. So, what do these numbers truly signify?

 

Known Clues: In Episode 2, Mark explains to Helly that each file from “upstairs” contains encoded numbers that fall into four categories, and each category “is meant to elicit an emotional reaction in the refiner”
looper.com
. The refiners only know how to sort data when a number makes them feel a specific intangible way – e.g. some numbers feel “scary” or “sad.” These correspond to Kier Eagan’s four tempers (Woe, Frolic, Dread, Malice) as later clues and production details confirm
severance-tv.fandom.com
. In short, MDR’s job is to sense emotional cues in data and segregate the numbers accordingly
looper.com
.

 

Prevailing Theories:

Psychological Conditioning: One evidence-backed theory is that MDR’s work is actually training or testing the severance implants’ ability to manipulate emotions. The fact that only severed employees do this task suggests the data might be coming from their own severance chips or related experiments. Indeed, the lore of Kier Eagan’s “taming the four tempers” implies that MDR could be about systematically identifying and controlling those four emotional drives
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. Under this theory, each sorting task helps Lumon calibrate the technology to suppress or invoke certain feelings – essentially refining the severance process itself. (Notably, a savvy viewer observed that the code names of MDR files – “WO”, “DR”, “FC”, “MA” – align with Woe, Dread, Frolic, Malice, hinting the refiners are literally sorting data tagged to those emotions
severance-tv.fandom.com
.)

Containing Something Dangerous: Another theory posits the numbers correspond to something real and possibly dangerous – for example, trapped consciousness or entities that the refiners unknowingly “cull.” This is more speculative, but Helly herself voices a version of it after seeing the baby goats (discussed later): she half-jokes that maybe the goats are the numbers – and that by sorting data, MDR might be deciding “which ones live and which ones die”
looper.com
. While fanciful, her comment underscores the workers’ fear that their mundane task could have life-and-death stakes.

Evidence & Likely Resolution: The clearest through-line is the Four Tempers framework introduced by Kier. Lumon’s leadership appears to take this seriously, as evidenced by the revered painting of “Kier Taming the Four Tempers” and even the Waffle Party ritual costumes
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. Each temper is associated with distinct emotions and symbols (e.g. Malice is a ram, which even appears as a mask at the Waffle Party)
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. This strongly implies that MDR’s numbers are abstract representations of human emotions, and the refiners’ task is to isolate and control these “tempers.” In practical terms, Lumon could be running a massive behavioral experiment, feeding patterns to severed workers to measure their emotional responses and adjust the severance implant accordingly
reddit.com
reddit.com
. The “quota” each refiner must reach might correspond not to a business metric, but to completing a cycle of testing or calibrations on the subject themselves
reddit.com
.

 

While Season 1 doesn’t spell out the purpose, the logical and thematic coherence of this explanation makes it the most likely: MDR is refining human emotion – essentially coding people. This aligns with the show’s theme of dehumanizing corporate control. It’s also supported by how disconnected the work is from any normal business output (even the characters note they produce nothing tangible)
looper.com
. Thus, the resolution that fits best is that the numbers are not traditional data at all, but a means to an end – Lumon’s attempt to perfect the severance process so they can manipulate human “tempers” on a grand scale. Future episodes will likely confirm this by revealing what happens “upstairs” with those sorted files (perhaps uploading the refiners’ emotional data to refine new chips or even to influence other severed subjects). This explanation is logically in step with the evidence and the company’s almost spiritual quest to conquer human nature.

Helly R.’s Identity and the Eagan Family Agenda

The Mystery: Helly R., the new hire in MDR, spends Season 1 desperately trying to escape Lumon – even attempting suicide – yet her outie refuses to let her resign. The finale reveals the stunning truth: Helly is actually Helena Eagan, daughter of Lumon’s CEO, Jame Eagan, and a direct descendant of founder Kier Eagan
people.com
. This revelation reframes her presence at Lumon and raises questions: Why would an Eagan heir sever herself and endure the very cruelty her company inflicts? And what will become of Helly after her innie’s rebellious act?

 

What We Know: Helly’s outie, Helena, is a public figure campaigning in favor of severance. When her innie “wakes up” on the outside via the overtime hack, Helly learns she was slated to give a pro-severance speech at a gala, touting herself as “the proud product of the severance program.” In that moment, it becomes clear Helena underwent severance voluntarily as a high-profile demonstration of Lumon’s flagship technology
people.com
looper.com
. Innie Helly’s horrified reaction – she calls severance a lie and describes innies as “tortured prisoners” to the assembled crowd – is a direct betrayal of what her outie stands for
looper.com
.

 

Prevailing Theories:

PR Stunt Gone Wrong: The most straightforward interpretation (supported by evidence) is that Helena’s stint as “Helly R.” was always a publicity stunt. As an Eagan, she has a vested interest in Severance’s success and likely volunteered to be severed to silence skeptics: after all, if the CEO’s own daughter works as a severed employee and endorses it, what stronger proof of confidence could there be? Indeed, at the gala we see Helena being celebrated for her commitment to the cause before innie Helly rebels
looper.com
. The theory here is that Helena never anticipated her innie would be so resistant – she viewed the innie as “not a person” but rather a temporary puppet to be used for the experiment. This explains her cold refusal to let Helly quit earlier in the season (recorded via video message), essentially commanding her innie to endure whatever it takes.

Eagan Family Power Dynamics: Some have speculated on a deeper familial motive – perhaps Helena had to prove herself to the family by surviving severance, or even that Kier’s bloodline subjects themselves to the process to fulfill some ritual. However, there’s scant direct evidence of this beyond the cultish reverence we see in Lumon’s culture. The simpler rationale remains: it was a corporate PR exercise first and foremost.

Evidence & Likely Resolution: The show provides clear evidence of Helly’s identity and intended role. Innie Helly’s discovery that she is an Eagan and her subsequent speech to expose the truth serve as the climax of Season 1’s conflict
looper.com
. The consequences are likely severe. Given that Helena was about to publicly praise severance, her innie’s hijacked speech is catastrophic for Lumon’s image – and for Helena’s own standing. We can deduce a few likely outcomes consistent with the show’s logic and themes: (1) Helena will face immense pressure (or punishment) from her family. Lumon executives might remove her from the severed program entirely or subject her to “correction.” The Season 1 finale already shows Cobel (disguised as Mrs. Selvig) physically confronting Helly to stop her from speaking, warning of “repercussions”
looper.com
. (2) Helly’s innie may not return to MDR – as one analyst noted, “from the company’s perspective, letting her back would be irresponsible and dangerous”
looper.com
. This implies that if Helena remains severed, they could isolate or recondition her innie (for example, in the mysterious testing floor). (3) On the other hand, her innie’s courageous public declaration might spark outside scrutiny. There were witnesses at the gala who heard her claim that severed workers are enslaved. This could plant seeds for the wider world to question Lumon, aligning with Severance’s theme of truth coming to light.

 

In sum, Helly’s storyline is likely to continue as a battle of wills between Helena (outie, indoctrinated heir) and Helly (innie, determined to be free). The confirmed resolution so far is her identity – she is an Eagan
people.com
 – and the most coherent path forward is that her innie’s actions will either force the Eagans to tighten their grip (perhaps making her a cautionary example) or inadvertently kickstart the downfall of the severance project by exposing its horrors. This duality encapsulates the show’s central tension between corporate loyalty and individual freedom.

Mark’s Wife, Gemma – Alive as Ms. Casey (Life, Death, and Severance)

The Mystery: Mark Scout’s entire motivation for undergoing severance was to escape the grief of losing his wife, Gemma, who supposedly died in a car accident. Yet, in the penultimate episode and finale, we (and Mark’s innie) learn the truth: Gemma is not dead – she is alive on the severed floor, known to Mark’s innie as the wellness counselor “Ms. Casey.” This jaw-dropping reveal raises many questions: How did Gemma become a severed employee? Did Lumon orchestrate her faked death? Does Mark’s outie have any inkling? What is Lumon’s intent with her?

 

What We Know: Ms. Casey (played by Dichen Lachman) conducts “wellness sessions,” reciting eerily scripted affirmations about an employee’s outie life. She is emotionally subdued, almost childlike in her lack of personal memories. We discover she has only 107 hours of “lifetime” on the severed clock – meaning she’s brought out for work sparingly, essentially a part-time innie
looper.com
. After Helly’s suicide attempt, the Board abruptly instructs Cobel to “permanently retire” Ms. Casey, suggesting she’s considered disposable. Cobel escorts Ms. Casey down to the off-limits “testing floor”, ominously telling her “You were extraordinary” – at which point we see the name “Gemma” on Ms. Casey’s file, confirming her identity just before the episode cuts away. Later, during the overtime emergency, Mark’s innie sees a photo of his wife and realizes “she’s alive!”
people.com
 – the same moment we confirm Gemma and Casey are one and the same.

 

Prevailing Theories:

“Project Gemma” – An Experiment in Reanimation or Memory: One theory is that Gemma’s death was no accident. Perhaps Lumon either caused the crash or took her body afterward to use as a test subject. The severance chip might be keeping Gemma alive (if she was comatose or brain-damaged) by creating a new persona (Ms. Casey) that can function at work. This would make Gemma’s case a pilot study in whether severance can “revive” someone in a limited capacity. The fact that Ms. Casey is activated only occasionally could imply she’s kept in a suspended state on the testing floor when not working – essentially, Gemma is Lumon’s guinea pig for extreme applications of the tech.

Mark as a Control Variable: Another angle is that Cobel (and Lumon) were closely observing Mark’s grief and Ms. Casey’s interactions as part of a psychological experiment. Harmony Cobel places herself in Mark’s personal life as his “neighbor,” clearly fascinated by his attachment to his dead wife’s memory. Some fans have noted that Cobel’s behavior – e.g. bringing Devon’s baby to visit her senile mother and calling the baby “Kier” – suggests she’s obsessed with life and death and possibly the idea of rebirth. It’s possible Lumon wanted to see if two severed halves (Mark and Gemma) could unknowingly reconnect on a spiritual level. Indeed, Mark and Ms. Casey do share a peculiar, subtle bond at work (a quiet comfort with each other) that Cobel remarks upon: at one point, Cobel pointedly asks Ms. Casey “How do you feel about Mark Scout?”, as if looking for signs of recognition. Ms. Casey only replies, “I feel…nothing,” highlighting how deeply the severance has wiped Gemma’s original self.

Evidence & Likely Resolution: The confirmed part of this mystery is that Gemma’s alive and severed – an enormous twist that recontextualizes Mark’s arc
people.com
. The likely resolution builds on what little evidence we have: Gemma’s condition and treatment imply she is an experiment. Her file, her limited hours, and the Board’s willingness to “dispose” of her indicate she’s not a regular employee but rather a test subject who has outlived her usefulness once the Helly incident occurs. It stands to reason that Lumon arranged for Gemma’s current state. Perhaps Gemma was critically injured (hence presumed dead to the outside world) and Lumon offered a deal to use the severance procedure to “save” her – effectively creating Ms. Casey in the process. This would be in line with Lumon’s biotech frontier ethos: they may be exploring memory implantation as a means of keeping someone technically alive but without their original identity. Another supported theory is that reintegration will come into play for Gemma. Just as Petey was reintegrated (though imperfectly), Mark may seek to restore Gemma fully. The tragedy is that Mark’s outie has no idea his wife lives, while Mark’s innie knows the truth but has no power outside – a poignant setup that underscores the show’s theme of fractured selves seeking wholeness.

 

Going forward, a logical development (supported by narrative need and theme) is that Mark will try to reunite with Gemma. The Season 1 finale leaves Mark’s outie shouting “she’s alive!” – presumably alerting his sister and possibly Cobel to the fact that Gemma’s fate is tangled with Lumon
people.com
people.com
. The most coherent conclusion is that Severance will move toward exposing how and why Gemma became Ms. Casey. Expect revelations that Lumon intervened in Gemma’s “death”, using her to test severance’s most extreme capabilities (such as resurrecting a person in piecemeal fashion). This directly ties into the show’s larger critique: Lumon not only severs office workers, it literally commodifies human life and death for its ends. Mark’s personal quest, then, is likely to collide with Lumon’s agenda – recovering Gemma’s identity would mean unraveling one of Lumon’s darkest secrets. In a show so focused on the value of genuine emotional life, the resolution with Gemma will probably affirm that her true self (and her love with Mark) cannot be erased without consequence.

The Baby Goats and Other Departmental Oddities

The Mystery: Midway through the season, Helly and Mark wander the halls and stumble upon a room filled with baby goats being tended by a lone employee. When startled, the man fiercely protects the goats, cryptically saying, “You can’t take them yet. They’re not ready. It isn’t time.”
looper.com
. This scene, utterly out of context, is one of the show’s strangest unanswered questions. Similarly, other departments like Optics & Design (O&D) harbor secrets: O&D initially claims to have only two employees making handbook art, but later we see they had many workers and equipment humming away, implying hidden projects
looper.com
. And of course, there are the two ominous paintings exchanged between MDR and O&D depicting each department slaughtering the other – apparently propaganda planted by management to keep them apart. What is going on in these less-understood parts of Lumon?

 

Prevailing Theories about the Goats:

Scientific/Biotech Experiment: The most common speculation is that the goats are part of a biotech experiment, possibly related to the severance chips or even human subjects. In pharmaceuticals and biotech, goats are sometimes used to produce antibodies or as test animals; some fans think these goats could be genetically altered or implanted with something Lumon needs. The caretaker’s warning “they’re not ready” suggests the goats are growing or maturing towards some purpose. Could they be hosts for human consciousness (a wild theory), or being used to incubate organic material for the chips? While no direct evidence in Season 1 confirms this, the idea fits Lumon’s profile as a “biotechnology corporation”
en.wikipedia.org
 and their penchant for literalizing metaphors (e.g. the four tempers represented physically). In Kier’s lore, Malice was symbolized by a ram
severance-tv.fandom.com
 – notably a goat-like creature – which raises the eyebrow that a room of young goats sits hidden in Lumon’s depths. Perhaps it’s symbolic, or perhaps those goats are being groomed as part of Lumon’s pursuit of taming “malice” or some such concept.

Distraction or Psychological Test: Another theory is that the goat room is intentionally absurd – a non sequitur designed to test employees’ reactions or to mislead outsiders. It’s so outlandish that even Mark is doubtful when Helly suggests the goats might relate to their work
looper.com
. If Lumon’s goal is to observe the severed workers under all sorts of stimuli, introducing random elements like a room of goats could gauge their curiosity or compliance. The fact that it’s never explained to MDR could be deliberate: it keeps them off-balance.

O&D and Other Departments: O&D’s hidden workforce and the “coup” paintings imply Lumon segregates its departments to prevent employees pooling knowledge. Burt (O&D head) eventually admits they actually have “many employees working like busy bees” on tasks beyond just painting pictures
looper.com
. This indicates each severed department might be working on separate pieces of a larger puzzle, kept ignorant of each other. The fake paintings of inter-department massacres were revealed to be propaganda (different versions shown to each team) to instill fear
looper.com
. This tactic serves Lumon’s interest by preventing collaboration. It’s strongly implied that the departments together might uncover Lumon’s grand design if they compared notes, hence the need to keep them siloed.

 

Evidence & Likely Resolution: The baby goats remain, by the end of Season 1, an intentional enigma – even the characters have “no rational idea” what they’re seeing
looper.com
. The showrunners have left this as one of the surreal mysteries to pay off later. Given the evidence, a likely resolution will tie the goats into Lumon’s bio-experiments. Perhaps the goats are being injected with something (maybe *“severed” themselves in some way) or are producing a substance needed for the chips. The key evidence is the caretaker’s urgency: “They’re not ready. It isn’t time.”
looper.com
 – implying that at a specific time, something will be done with or to these goats. That kind of phrasing is often used for either scheduled experiments or rituals. Considering the cultish undertones at Lumon, it could even be both (a scientific ritual). Thematically, it wouldn’t be surprising if Lumon’s quest to control human nature crosses into grotesque territory – possibly even trying to blur lines between human and animal (as a metaphor for dehumanization).

 

For O&D and other departments, the likely resolution is more straightforward: Season 2 and beyond will probably reveal what each department actually produces and how it feeds Lumon’s master plan. We’ve already gathered that O&D is involved in manufacturing Lumon propaganda (handbook kits, paintings) and something else on a larger scale (they had maps and equipment suggesting they also map the building or work on hardware). The Optics in O&D might hint at surveillance or perception management. Similarly, the goats could belong to a department (some fans dub it the “Goat Department”) with a specific research focus. In sum, these oddities are pieces of world-building that point to Lumon conducting wide-ranging experiments (psychological, technological, and biological) under one roof. The most coherent explanation is simply that a company as powerful and secretive as Lumon will have many such projects – baby animals, bizarre art, brainwashing tapes – all serving the endgame of perfecting severance and whatever societal control it’s aiming for. Season 1 lays the groundwork by showing us these uncanny fragments; the resolution will come as the characters (and thus we) connect these fragments to the central plot of severance. Until then, the baby goats remain a symbol of Severance’s uncanny atmosphere – an unresolved riddle that teases the breadth of Lumon’s machinations.

Rituals, Cults, and Kier Eagan’s Legacy

The Mystery: From the perpetually smiling Kier Eagan statues to the bizarre Waffle Party, Severance paints Lumon as more than a company – it’s a cult of personality and philosophy. The employees follow a “Compliance Handbook” full of quasi-scriptural aphorisms. They celebrate seemingly innocuous milestones (music dance breaks, melon bars, waffle parties) that carry strange undertones. The Waffle Party, in particular, starts as a goofy reward (eat all the waffles you want) and turns into a fetishistic ceremony: one refiner (Dylan) dons a Kier Eagan head mask and sits on a bed while figures wearing the four tempers’ masks perform a suggestive dance around him
severance-tv.fandom.com
. Harmony Cobel herself maintains a shrine to Kier in her house and engages in secret rituals (like using Mark’s sister’s baby in a weird devotional moment). All of this begs the question: Is Lumon essentially a cult, and what role does Kier’s legacy play in the present? Is Kier (the long-deceased founder) somehow still exerting influence – metaphorically or even literally?

 

Prevailing Theories:

Kier Eagan as a Deified Figure: Clearly, Kier is treated as if he’s omnipresent. The employees pray to his principles, and myths abound of his exploits (taming the tempers, pardoning betrayals, etc.). One theory is that the Eagan family deliberately runs Lumon as a cult, using Kier’s mythology to enforce loyalty. The reverence is a tool: employees (especially upper management like Cobel) who buy in will treat the company’s mission with religious fervor. This theory is strongly supported by the show’s content – from the perpetuity museum with wax dioramas of Kier’s life, to daily oaths and quotes the employees recite. Even the fact that Helly is an Eagan shows the family line is still deeply involved in the company’s day-to-day. They are, in effect, a dynastic cult leadership.

The Board and Kier – Possible Continuation: A more far-fetched idea (but one some fans contemplate) is that Kier Eagan isn’t entirely “gone.” Perhaps his consciousness, or at least his exacting doctrine, lives on through the Board or some AI. When Helly’s outie remarks that Kier “appears entirely alive, contrary to what we’ve been told,”
looper.com
 it’s likely a figurative expression of how present his persona is – though it momentarily sparks the notion: could the Board (which speaks through a distorted intercom and never shows their faces) be literally Kier’s preserved mind or descendants enacting his will? No concrete evidence in Season 1 confirms a sci-fi resurrection of Kier, but the feeling of his presence is deliberately kept strong. For now, it’s safer to say the Board are probably living Eagans or loyalists rather than ghosts of Kier.

Evidence & Likely Resolution: The cult aspect is well-evidenced. Lumon’s corporate culture mimics religion: daily mantras in the Break Room (“I forgive you for the harm you have caused this world” repeated endlessly), the reverence of artifacts (e.g. Kier’s actual book or handprints), and the promise of existential reward (the employees are told if they’re dutiful, they’ll reach the “Last Tier” and meet Kier in some afterlife-like scenario). These aren’t typical office HR policies – they’re indoctrination. The Waffle Party is a tangible piece of evidence for how surreal and ritualistic things have become: the masks worn by the dancers correspond to Kier’s four tempers, essentially turning a simple reward into a reenactment of Kier’s philosophical victory over human weakness
severance-tv.fandom.com
severance-tv.fandom.com
. This indicates the upper echelons at Lumon stage these rituals to honor Kier’s legacy and possibly to subconsciously influence the participants (Dylan was noticeably uncomfortable and distracted by the strange erotic pageant, which gave him the chance to escape and trigger the overtime contingency).

 

The likely resolution regarding Lumon’s cultism is that it’s part of how the company maintains power. As the innies become more self-aware, they may start to see the absurdity of these customs and reject them (as Helly’s innie already did vocally). We can expect that the Eagan family’s intentions will be further unveiled – possibly revealing that Kier’s writings (like the “four tempers”) are the blueprint for all of Lumon’s projects. The show sets up Kier Eagan as a quasi-mythic figure whose shadow looms over everything; the payoff might involve discovering something literal, like a secret vault (maybe on the testing floor) where Kier’s original experiments or even his preserved body/mind reside. At the very least, we will see the modern Eagans (Jame Eagan, Helena, etc.) doubling down on Kier’s dogma in response to the rebellion. In a thematic sense, the resolution here is not just plot-based but emotional: the cult-like control is meant to break people’s individuality, and the series is clearly moving toward individuals (Mark, Helly, Irving, Dylan) reclaiming their sense of self. Therefore, dismantling the Kier cult—symbolically slaying the “false god” of Lumon—may be necessary for our protagonists to truly gain freedom. The evidence thus far (the increasingly blatant parallels to religion) suggests that Severance will ultimately cast a critical eye on fanaticism and inherited power. The innies forming their own community (across departments) and trusting each other is the antithesis of the Kier worship meant to isolate them – a narrative trajectory that mirrors overcoming cult indoctrination. In concrete terms, we anticipate Season 2 will directly confront the Eagan family and possibly expose the Board, shedding light on how much of Kier’s myth is real versus manufactured. The show’s commitment to “evidence-backed” storytelling implies we’ll get a logical unraveling of the cult – showing us why these rituals existed and how they served Lumon’s scientific goals (for example, did the Waffle Party have a psychological purpose, or was it pure religious homage?).

 

In summary, Lumon’s cultish veneer is not just window-dressing; it’s a key to understanding the stakes. The unresolved mystery of Kier’s true legacy will likely resolve with a clearer picture of what the Eagans really believe severance can achieve – perhaps nothing short of a perfected human soul, which in Kier’s eyes would make him almost a savior figure. That grandiose aim, once revealed, will tie together the personal and philosophical conflicts driving the series.

Irving’s Visions and the Dark Secrets of the “Testing Floor”

The Mystery: Irving (MDR’s most senior employee) experiences unsettling hallucinations at work – black oil-like drips seeping from the ceiling and visions of a long dark corridor. Outside of work, Irving’s outie is revealed to obsessively paint the same corridor over and over, and he has a trunk full of documents hinting at an off-hours investigation into Lumon
looper.com
looper.com
. In the finale, innie Irving uses his brief freedom to drive to the home of Burt (his O&D friend/lover), suggesting Irving’s outie discovered Burt’s identity and address. All signs point to Irving having a unique connection to Lumon’s darker recesses – notably the mysterious “testing floor,” which we haven’t seen but has been ominously referenced.

 

What We Know: Irving’s outie life gives crucial context: he’s a military veteran (U.S. Navy) and lives a regimented, solitary life, listening to war hymns and working on his paintings
people.com
. The fact he continuously paints Lumon’s testing floor hallway (a place his innie has only briefly seen when escorting Ms. Casey) implies a bleed-through of memory or at least subconscious impression
people.com
. Additionally, Irving keeps a map or list of Lumon employees’ addresses at home, indicating that he (his outie) is actively researching his colleagues or perhaps looking for former employees. On Lumon’s end, we know Irving has been severed longer than his peers and is exceptionally indoctrinated (quoting the handbook and defending the company line early on). However, his loyalty falters once Burt is forced to retire, prompting Irving to join the others’ rebellion plan
people.com
.

 

Prevailing Theories:

Severance Side-Effects (Cognitive Leak): The most plausible explanation for Irving’s visions is that the severance implant isn’t perfect. Irving’s hallucinations of black fluid could be a neurological glitch – possibly his brain trying to reconcile the two lives. As Looper’s analysis notes, these “horrifying visions” might be chip malfunctions from his unusually long tenure
looper.com
. It’s as if his brain knows something dark (the black paint) that his conscious mind can’t contextualize. Supporting this, the black corridor he paints is very real – it’s the elevator route to the testing floor – so at some level, Irving’s mind retained that imagery. This suggests the barrier between his innie and outie has hairline cracks, leaking impressions (in this case, fear associated with the testing floor, represented by dripping black substance)
looper.com
.

Personal Vendetta or Mission: Another theory is that Irving’s outie might have gotten severed for the purpose of investigating Lumon from the inside. It’s curious that outie Irving has all those Lumon-related files. Perhaps as a veteran or someone who lost a loved one to severance, he severed himself to infiltrate the company, and his meticulous note-taking and painting is his way of cataloguing what his innie experiences (even if he can’t directly remember, he might see the paintings he himself made while “out”). While speculative, this would cast Irving’s goofy rule-following innie in a new light – he could unknowingly be part of a larger plan by his outie. The evidence for this is subtle: the fact that Irving immediately set out to find Burt upon being woken up outside indicates his outie knew exactly where to go. He had Burt’s address, meaning he identified Burt’s outie at some point. This level of info suggests deliberate sleuthing by outie Irving
looper.com
looper.com
.

Evidence & Likely Resolution: Season 1 provides pieces of evidence that Irving’s experiences are central to uncovering Lumon’s worst deeds. The Testing Floor is a term loaded with dread – Ms. Casey’s removal there implies it’s where severed employees who are “retired” or experimented on end up. Irving’s fixation on that hallway in his art means he’s haunted by it. The likely resolution is two-fold: (1) We will learn what happens on the testing floor (be it reintegration experiments, memory wipes, or storage of inert innies). Given Irving’s clues, it could be something harrowing – perhaps where employees who “die” inside are kept, or where the severed consciousness goes when not in use (as possibly with Gemma). (2) Irving will confront the outcome of Burt’s “retirement.” It’s ambiguous if Burt’s outie simply quit or if something sinister was done to him. Irving finding Burt’s home could reveal whether Burt remembers Irving (if Burt was unsuspended and reintegrated normally, his outie would have no idea; if something else happened, there may be a twist). The emotional drive is clear: Irving, the rule follower, is now driven by love to break the rules. This is likely to bring him face-to-face with the testing floor because that’s the one place connected to both his trauma (the visions) and his motivation (possibly finding what happened to Ms. Casey or ensuring Burt is okay).

 

Given the evidence, the most coherent explanation is that Irving’s brain has been resisting the severance boundaries. The “black rain” vision could symbolize his latent dread – a temper Kier said needed taming – seeping through. In a show so carefully crafted, that image is no random scare: it’s tied to Lumon’s core secrets. Therefore, we anticipate that the resolution of Irving’s mystery will involve him (and maybe the other rebels) literally descending into Lumon’s depths (the testing floor) to uncover whatever darkness the company is hiding. Whether his outie had a premeditated agenda or not, by Season 2 he effectively has an agenda: expose Lumon’s lies, partly to protect the man he cares for. This personal stake ensures that Irving will be our guide into the heart of Lumon’s darkness. As for the severance side-effects angle, that serves as a cautionary note: it proves that the technology is flawed and that memories and emotions can’t be neatly partitioned – a key theme mirrored in every character (e.g. Petey’s reintegration sickness, Mark’s lingering melancholy). Irving’s case provides scientific plausibility within the narrative that severance can fail. The likely outcome is that Irving’s unraveling will furnish proof (perhaps via a medical perspective) that severance causes neurological damage, further bolstering the case against Lumon. In summary, Irving’s visions and the testing floor are two sides of the same coin: both point to the inhuman lengths Lumon will go to in order to achieve its aims, and both will likely be pivotal in Season 2’s drive toward revealing and hopefully dismantling those practices.

Parallels with Other Fictional Works

Severance is a unique blend, but it draws on a rich tradition of speculative fiction about identity, control, and corporate dystopia. The show’s creators have acknowledged inspiration from or resonance with several earlier works. Below, we compare Severance to a few notable examples, focusing only on comparisons backed by at least three specific connections in themes or content.

Severance and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)

Michel Gondry’s film Eternal Sunshine explores a procedure that selectively erases memories of a painful relationship. There are clear parallels between this and Severance’s premise:

Memory Removal to Alleviate Pain: In Eternal Sunshine, Joel undergoes the procedure to forget his ex-girlfriend and ease his heartbreak. Mark undergoes severance to escape the pain of his wife’s death
people.com
people.com
. Both works revolve around using technology to cope with grief by literally removing the memories of that grief
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
.

Unintended Consequences: Both stories reveal that erasing pain isn’t a true solution. In Eternal Sunshine, as Joel’s memories are erased, his subconscious resists and he realizes he doesn’t want to forget his love. In Severance, Mark’s “cure” is incomplete – his outie is numb, but his innie still experiences emptiness, and ultimately, neither part of him actually processes the loss. This underscores a shared theme: the resilience of emotional truth. As the Peabody analysis notes, Severance and Eternal Sunshine both show that attempts to control memory “isn’t always so easy” and can backfire
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
.

Ethical Implications of Memory Tech: Both works use their sci-fi device to raise ethical questions. In Eternal Sunshine, there’s an implicit critique of whether doctors should tamper with memories at all, and we see fallout (e.g. a technician uses the procedure to take advantage of a patient). Severance takes this further in a corporate context: innies are essentially a by-product of someone editing their own mind for convenience. The ethical dilemma – is it right to “delete” part of yourself? – is central to both. While Eternal Sunshine has a more romantic, hopeful tone in the end, Severance is darker, yet both caution against the notion that we can simply cut out the bad without losing something essential of ourselves
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
.

In short, Severance can be seen as Eternal Sunshine’s concept applied to the workplace and taken to an extreme. The proven connections are the concept of memory erasure for emotional management, the narrative that personal pain finds a way back, and the moral that living with even painful memories is part of being human
peabodyawards.com

.

Severance and Lost (2004–2010)

Though very different in setting, Severance has often been compared to the TV series Lost for its mystery-box storytelling and thematic depth. The comparison isn’t just surface-level; there are substantial parallels:

Mysterious Organization & Experiments: Lost featured the Dharma Initiative, a secretive group running bizarre experiments on an island, often involving psychological and electromagnetic tests on unwitting subjects. Likewise, Severance has Lumon, a secretive corporation conducting unethical experiments on its employees’ minds. Both stories gradually peel back layers to reveal what these organizations are up to. For example, early Lost episodes showed characters pushing a button in a hatch without knowing why (much like MDR refiners sorting numbers without context) – later revealed to be a psychological experiment and a real failsafe. Severance mirrors this blend of psychological manipulation with real stakes, as the workers perform tasks that might be both tests and functional operations.

Character-Centric Mystery and Backstory Reveals: Both series emphasize character development through unveiling their past or outside lives piece by piece. Lost pioneered the use of flashbacks (and later flash-forwards) to show who the characters were before the island, directly affecting how we interpret their actions. Severance essentially embeds this structure into its premise: the “outside world” sequences act as flashbacks that gradually inform us about Mark, Helly, Irving, and Dylan’s true selves. Each reveal (Gemma’s fate, Helly’s identity, Irving’s investigations, Dylan’s child) recontextualizes the character just as, say, learning John Locke was in a wheelchair recontextualized him in Lost. This narrative technique – unfolding backstory to solve mysteries – is a shared DNA
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
. The Peabody Awards commentary even called Severance “Lost in an office” due to its surreal mysteries (like the goats) and focus on a core group with hidden connections
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
.

Themes of Community and Sacrifice: Despite Severance’s corporate coldness and Lost’s supernatural island, both ultimately stress human connection. Lost repeatedly showed that survival depended on the castaways coming together and often sacrificing for one another, encapsulated in the famous line “live together, die alone.” In Severance, the four MDR team members (and their O&D friends) form a bond in defiance of the system – they choose trust and solidarity over isolation. Their plan to expose Lumon requires personal risk and sacrifice (Dylan literally giving up his freedom in that closet to hold the switches, Irving risking his hopes with Burt, Helly endangering herself to tell the truth)
people.com
people.com
. This echoes Lost’s ethos. Critics have noted that Severance, like Lost, believes in “the life-saving power of community” and “the heroism of sacrifice for others”
peabodyawards.com
. Both shows counteract their mysteries and conspiracies with a deeply humanist message: people need each other to find meaning and break free from fear.

These parallels are more than coincidental. Series creator Dan Erickson has cited shows like Lost as influential in proving that complex, weird mysteries can thrive on TV, and Severance consciously “learned some lessons” from Lost – such as maintaining focus on character and giving just enough answers to keep the story coherent
peabodyawards.com
. The three major connections – secret experiments, structural storytelling techniques, and core themes – make Lost a fitting comparison that informs Severance’s content and approach
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
.

Severance and Portal (2007 video game)

Perhaps surprisingly, a first-person puzzle video game shares some of the most concrete and specific parallels with Severance. Valve’s Portal is about a woman (Chell) trapped in the sterile Aperture Science facility, forced to undergo tests by an AI overseer. The Peabody Awards analysis drew multiple one-to-one comparisons between Portal and Severance, including:

Waking in a Confined Lab with a Dissonant Guide: Portal begins with Chell waking in an unfamiliar testing chamber, greeted by the disembodied voice of GLaDOS giving orientation instructions. Severance similarly opens with Helly awakening disoriented on the conference table, with a disembodied voice (Milchick via intercom, and later Cobel) conducting her orientation
peabodyawards.com
. In both cases, the protagonist is being treated as a test subject from the first moment, and the voice presents as polite/tutorial while concealing the true stakes. The staging of Helly’s opening scene – alone in a minimalist room, answering bizarre questions from an unseen evaluator – is strikingly similar to Portal’s tone and setup
peabodyawards.com
.

Unknown Identity and Desire to Escape: Chell in Portal is essentially anonymous; we know nothing of her backstory or who she is, and she’s defined by her actions trying to escape the facility. Helly, especially initially, also has no identity (even to herself, since her innie has no memories). Her entire arc in Season 1 is attempting escape – through the halls, via resignation requests, even by self-harm – much like how the player’s goal in Portal is to break free of Aperture’s tests. Both Helly and Chell demonstrate resourcefulness and defiance. Notably, the Portal tagline “The cake is a lie” (graffiti revealing that the promised reward is a sham) finds a dark echo in Severance: the “Waffle Party” is real cake (or waffles) but comes with a disturbing ritual attached
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
. In Portal, GLaDOS dangles cake as a reward for compliance; in Severance, Lumon dangles incentives like waffle parties or melon bars to encourage productivity. Both works show these “rewards” to be manipulative tools. (The Peabody piece cleverly notes that Portal’s promised cake is fake, whereas Severance’s waffles exist but “the party isn’t what you expect.”
peabodyawards.com
)

Unreliable Authority and Restricted Information: GLaDOS in Portal constantly lies or omits truth to keep Chell under control, providing only information that serves the experiment. Similarly, Lumon management (Cobel, Milchick, the handbook) only tell the severed employees what will keep them working. Mark and team are never told what their work means
looper.com
, and any time they probe, they’re stonewalled – much like how GLaDOS deflects Chell’s questions or attempts at reasoning. The vibe of moving through sterile test chambers in Portal, with no context except the AI’s instructions, is mirrored by MDR moving from one imposed task to the next under the watchful eye of Cobel’s surveillance. Even aesthetically, Lumon’s white corridors and retro-modern terminals evoke a test environment. Another fun detail: Portal and Severance both employ dark humor via their authority figures. GLaDOS makes dry, sinister jokes at the player’s expense; Cobel and Milchick likewise often maintain an unsettling cheeriness and corporate jargon that contrasts with the horror of what they’re doing (e.g. Milchick turning a violent security breach into a peppy “Music Dance Experience”). This tonal similarity underscores the parallel commentary on corporate/AI soullessness.

With these specific points of connection – the opening scenario, the escape motif with false rewards, and the dynamic of a manipulative overseer – it’s evident that Portal informed Severance. In fact, Ben Stiller and Dan Erickson have acknowledged knowing the comparison; Erickson even devised Helly’s opening scene without realizing the Portal resemblance until others pointed it out, at which point he welcomed the parallel as fitting
peabodyawards.com
. The show doubles down on it with cheeky nods (waffles vs. cake). All told, Severance can be seen as a narrative, human-character-driven take on Portal’s core scenario: a person in a maze of experiments fighting against an inhuman system for freedom
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
.

Severance and Workplace Satire (The Office, Office Space, etc.)

Beyond sci-fi parallels, Severance is deeply rooted in workplace satire. It often feels like a darker mirror to comedies like The Office or the cult film Office Space, and this is by design:

Banal Office Culture Turned Absurd: Severance exaggerates real corporate quirks – zealous team-building, emblems of the “employee of the month,” awkward elevator small talk – by placing them in an extreme setting. For example, the office perks in Severance (finger traps for good work, waffle parties, dance breaks) are humorous in the same way The Office’s pointless meetings or Office Space’s TPS reports are: they highlight the emptiness of corporate morale boosters. Ben Stiller noted the show “was based in [a] comedic structure of an office workplace comedy” when he first read the script
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
. This is evidenced by many scenes in Season 1 that could almost be from a sitcom if not for the sinister context – like a cringe-worthy team camaraderie exercise or Mark’s inept boss act when Helly arrives.

Characters as Office Archetypes with a Twist: Dylan, for instance, provides comic relief with his impish enthusiasm for incentives and rivalry with O&D, akin to a Dwight Schrute from The Office (overzealous about company lore)
peabodyawards.com
. In fact, Stiller explicitly likened Dylan to a bizarre version of Dwight
peabodyawards.com
. The show uses these familiar archetypes – the jaded veteran (Irving, a twist on the know-it-all employee), the newcomer who shakes things up (Helly, much like a new hire in any office comedy causing disruption), the eccentric middle-manager (Milchick with his fixed grin could be seen as an extreme HR rep). By grounding the characters in recognizable types, Severance invites comparison to workplace comedies, only to subvert it when, say, a break-room reprimand turns into psychological torture. This combination of the mundane and the macabre is a hallmark of Severance’s tone.

Commentary on Work-Life Balance: Comedies like Office Space famously satirize the dehumanizing routine of cubicle life and the desire to reclaim one’s life from one’s job. Severance takes that premise – “I wish I could leave work at work” – and gives it a science fiction literalism. The core satire is that splitting your work and personal life isn’t actually healthy; it creates basically a new person condemned to eternal office hell. This is an implicit critique of work culture taken to extremes, just as The Office or Dilbert cartoon strip exaggerate office absurdities for humor. Dan Erickson drew from his own monotonic office jobs in writing Severance, channeling those experiences into the show’s absurd procedures (like macrodata refiners celebrating quarterly quotas they don’t understand, much as real employees celebrate largely meaningless corporate targets). The fundamental disconnect the severance procedure creates is a form of dark comedy: Mark’s outie drinks away his evenings in misery, while his innie is forced into forced gaiety at a “Music Dance Experience.” This split is an on-the-nose satire of how companies expect workers to shelve personal problems and be cheerfully productive – Severance just makes it literal.

The connections here are more thematic, but nonetheless specific in execution – many critics describe Severance as “The Office meets Black Mirror” because it so clearly invokes the tropes of the modern workplace to ground its sci-fi concept
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
. In evidence, we have the creators’ own words and the Peabody essay noting how scenes like the melon bar party are straight out of an office satire playbook
peabodyawards.com
peabodyawards.com
. By understanding Severance in the context of workplace comedies, we appreciate how it both honors and twists that genre: the jokes are there (quietly), but each punchline has a horror stinger. This blend amplifies the show’s critique of dehumanizing workplaces far more effectively than comedy or drama alone could.

Here's the research you previously provided me:

Great. I’ll conduct a deep dive into the major unresolved mysteries in *Severance*, analyzing academic-style theories and evidence-backed conclusions. I’ll prioritize the most logical and likely resolutions, rather than speculative fan theories. Additionally, I’ll look for any other fictional works that meaningfully inform *Severance*’s themes and content, ensuring they meet your criteria of three proven points of connection before including them.

I’ll get back to you with a comprehensive analysis as soon as possible.

# Major Unresolved Mysteries in *Severance* (Season 1) – Analysis and Likely Resolutions

*Severance* presents a labyrinth of unanswered questions, blending corporate dystopia with psychological mystery. Below, we dissect each major mystery from Season 1, outline prevailing theories (grounded in evidence rather than wild speculation), and evaluate the most plausible resolutions. We also compare *Severance* to other works of fiction where meaningful, evidence-backed parallels exist, highlighting at least three concrete connections in each case.

## Lumon’s True Purpose and the Severance Experiment

**The Mystery:** What is Lumon Industries *really* doing with the severance procedure and its severed employees? The company’s public rationale is work-life balance, but the extremes of control and secrecy on the severed floor suggest a darker agenda. Employees can’t truly quit, their behaviors are micromanaged, and bizarre “wellness” sessions and punishments (like the Break Room) feel more like brainwashing than office perks ([Severance: 4 unsolved mysteries about Lumon, the evil corporation explored in depth](https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/severance-4-unsolved-mysteries-lumon-evil-corporation-explored-depth#:~:text=Lumon%20isn%E2%80%99t%20just%20a%20regular,and%20their%20minds%20are%20manipulated)). Cobel (Harmony) hints to the Board about *“reintegration”* being possible (as with Petey), only to be rebuffed – implying the company hides more than it admits.

**Prevailing Theories:**  
- **Mind Control Experiments:** Many suspect Lumon is refining a form of mind control or behavior modification technology. The strict monitoring and conditioning of innies – from coded **“wellness”** sayings to the terrifying Break Room mantras – hint that severance is an experiment in reshaping human identity and obedience ([Severance: 4 unsolved mysteries about Lumon, the evil corporation explored in depth](https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/severance-4-unsolved-mysteries-lumon-evil-corporation-explored-depth#:~:text=Lumon%20isn%E2%80%99t%20just%20a%20regular,and%20their%20minds%20are%20manipulated)) ([Severance: 4 unsolved mysteries about Lumon, the evil corporation explored in depth](https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/severance-4-unsolved-mysteries-lumon-evil-corporation-explored-depth#:~:text=The%20severance%20process%20isn%E2%80%99t%20just,But%20for%20what)).  
- **Memory Harvesting or Data Mining:** Another theory is that Lumon might be using employees’ brains to harvest data or memories for secret projects ([Severance: 4 unsolved mysteries about Lumon, the evil corporation explored in depth](https://www.soapcentral.com/shows/severance-4-unsolved-mysteries-lumon-evil-corporation-explored-depth#:~:text=,used%20for%20something%20even%20darker)). The fact that only *severed* individuals can perform certain tasks suggests the company is exploiting the unique state of innies for a larger goal.  
- **Cultivating Wider Societal Control:** Evidence from outside Lumon indicates a push to normalize severance in society. A state senator (Angelo Arteta) champions pro-severance legislation, and his own wife underwent a severance procedure to forget the pain of childbirth ([Hide and Seek (Severance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_Seek_(Severance)#:~:text=Burt%20,him%20by%20revoking%20MDR%27s%20hallway)) ([Hide and Seek (Severance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_Seek_(Severance)#:~:text=forced%20to%20go%20to%20the,Selvig)). This implies Lumon’s goal is expansion – applying memory division to motherhood, perhaps warfare, or other aspects of life, effectively extending corporate control into the personal sphere.

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** The **Eagan family** (Lumon’s founders) treat severance as more than a business – it’s almost evangelical. Helena “Helly” Eagan’s participation (see below) was intended as a PR spectacle to sell the public on severance ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=actually%20his%20outie%E2%80%99s%20wife%20Gemma%2C,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)). Lumon’s museum-like Perpetuity Wing, with Kier Eagan’s wax figure and holy quotes, underscores that the company’s purpose is quasi-religious: achieving Kier’s vision of “taming” human nature ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=,all%20of%20you%2C%20my%20children)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=The%20Four%20Tempers%20are%20a,also%20the%20world%20around%20them)). In Kier’s own words, each person is composed of *“four tempers”* (Woe, Frolic, Dread, Malice), and *“should you tame the tempers as I did mine, then the world shall become but your appendage”* ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=,all%20of%20you%2C%20my%20children)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=The%20Four%20Tempers%20are%20a,also%20the%20world%20around%20them)). This suggests Lumon’s ultimate goal is **total control over human minds and emotions**, first in the workplace and eventually in society at large. The likely resolution is that the severance chips and the bizarre workplace rituals are designed to let Lumon **perfect behavioral control**, creating human beings who conform exactly to the company’s (or Kier’s) ideal temperament ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=The%20Four%20Tempers%20are%20a,also%20the%20world%20around%20them)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=expression.%20,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)). In essence, Lumon appears to be using its employees as test subjects to refine this technology – a conclusion supported by the company’s push for legal acceptance of severance and the evidence of severance being used outside Lumon (e.g. Gabby’s childbirth) to prove its “benefits” ([Hide and Seek (Severance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_Seek_(Severance)#:~:text=Burt%20,him%20by%20revoking%20MDR%27s%20hallway)) ([Hide and Seek (Severance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_Seek_(Severance)#:~:text=forced%20to%20go%20to%20the,Selvig)). Season 1 stops short of confirming the full plan, but all signs point to a large-scale ambition: **to expand severance and cement the Eagans’ power by reshaping human memory and identity**. This aligns with the show’s central theme of personal autonomy versus corporate (or cultish) control.

## The Meaning of Macrodata Refinement – What Are the Numbers?

**The Mystery:** Mark and his Macrodata Refinement (MDR) team spend their days sorting mysterious numbers on their computer screens into bins, based on an *“emotional”* instinct. They’re told nothing about what the data represents or why they must sort it. Even the refiners themselves continually ask, *“What are we actually doing?”* and get no answer ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=emotional%20reaction%20do%20they%20know,box%20each%20line%20of%20code)). So, what do these numbers truly signify?

**Known Clues:** In **Episode 2**, Mark explains to Helly that each file from “upstairs” contains encoded numbers that fall into four categories, and each category *“is meant to elicit an emotional reaction in the refiner”* ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=The%20folks%20at%20O%26D%20don%27t,box%20each%20line%20of%20code)). The refiners only know how to sort data when a number makes them feel a specific intangible way – e.g. some numbers feel “scary” or “sad.” These correspond to Kier Eagan’s four tempers (Woe, Frolic, Dread, Malice) as later clues and production details confirm ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=Trivia)). In short, MDR’s job is to sense emotional cues in data and segregate the numbers accordingly ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=The%20folks%20at%20O%26D%20don%27t,box%20each%20line%20of%20code)).

**Prevailing Theories:**  
- **Psychological Conditioning:** One evidence-backed theory is that MDR’s work is actually training or testing the severance implants’ ability to manipulate emotions. The fact that only severed employees do this task suggests the *data* might be coming from their own severance chips or related experiments. Indeed, the lore of Kier Eagan’s “taming the four tempers” implies that MDR could be about systematically identifying and controlling those four emotional drives ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=The%20Four%20Tempers%20are%20a,also%20the%20world%20around%20them)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=expression.%20,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)). Under this theory, each sorting task helps Lumon calibrate the technology to suppress or invoke certain feelings – essentially **refining the severance process itself**. (Notably, a savvy viewer observed that the code names of MDR files – “WO”, “DR”, “FC”, “MA” – align with **Woe, Dread, Frolic, Malice**, hinting the refiners are literally sorting data tagged to those emotions ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=Trivia)).)  
- **Containing Something Dangerous:** Another theory posits the numbers correspond to **something real and possibly dangerous** – for example, trapped consciousness or entities that the refiners unknowingly “cull.” This is more speculative, but Helly herself voices a version of it after seeing the baby goats (discussed later): she half-jokes that *maybe the goats **are** the numbers* – and that by sorting data, MDR might be deciding “which ones live and which ones die” ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=corridors%20when%20they%20discover%20a,It%20isn%27t%20time)). While fanciful, her comment underscores the workers’ fear that their mundane task could have life-and-death stakes.

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** The clearest through-line is the **Four Tempers framework** introduced by Kier. Lumon’s leadership appears to take this seriously, as evidenced by the revered painting of *“Kier Taming the Four Tempers”* and even the Waffle Party ritual costumes ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=expression.%20,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=The%20Kier%20Cycle%20oil%20painting,woman%20in%20a%20bridal%20dress)). Each temper is associated with distinct emotions and symbols (e.g. Malice is a ram, which even appears as a mask at the Waffle Party) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=expression.%20,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)). This strongly implies that **MDR’s numbers are abstract representations of human emotions**, and the refiners’ task is to isolate and control these “tempers.” In practical terms, Lumon could be running a massive **behavioral experiment**, feeding patterns to severed workers to measure their emotional responses and adjust the severance implant accordingly ([What is Macrodata Refinement (really)? : r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1ai6tqo/what_is_macrodata_refinement_really/#:~:text=Based%20on%20those%20assumptions%2C%20here,sample%20testing%20on%20a%20subject)) ([What is Macrodata Refinement (really)? : r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1ai6tqo/what_is_macrodata_refinement_really/#:~:text=about%20refining%20numbers%2C%20it%27s%20about,sample%20testing%20on%20a%20subject)). The “quota” each refiner must reach might correspond not to a business metric, but to completing a cycle of testing or calibrations on the subject themselves ([What is Macrodata Refinement (really)? : r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1ai6tqo/what_is_macrodata_refinement_really/#:~:text=Based%20on%20those%20assumptions%2C%20here,sample%20testing%20on%20a%20subject)). 

While Season 1 doesn’t spell out the purpose, the logical and thematic coherence of this explanation makes it the most likely: **MDR is refining human emotion** – essentially coding people. This aligns with the show’s theme of dehumanizing corporate control. It’s also supported by how disconnected the work is from any normal business output (even the characters note they produce nothing tangible) ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=Despite%20this%20apparently%20simple%20description%2C,people%20for%20their%20own%20benefit)). Thus, the resolution that fits best is that *the numbers are not traditional data at all, but a means to an end – Lumon’s attempt to perfect the severance process so they can manipulate human “tempers” on a grand scale*. Future episodes will likely confirm this by revealing what happens “upstairs” with those sorted files (perhaps uploading the refiners’ emotional data to refine new chips or even to influence other severed subjects). This explanation is logically in step with the evidence and the company’s almost spiritual quest to conquer human nature.

## Helly R.’s Identity and the Eagan Family Agenda

**The Mystery:** Helly R., the new hire in MDR, spends Season 1 desperately trying to escape Lumon – even attempting suicide – yet her outie refuses to let her resign. The finale reveals the stunning truth: **Helly is actually Helena Eagan**, daughter of Lumon’s CEO, Jame Eagan, and a direct descendant of founder Kier Eagan ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=actually%20his%20outie%E2%80%99s%20wife%20Gemma%2C,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)). This revelation reframes her presence at Lumon and raises questions: Why would an Eagan heir sever herself and endure the very cruelty her company inflicts? And what will become of Helly after her innie’s rebellious act?

**What We Know:** Helly’s outie, Helena, is a public figure campaigning in *favor* of severance. When her innie “wakes up” on the outside via the overtime hack, Helly learns she was slated to give a pro-severance speech at a gala, touting herself as *“the proud product of the severance program.”* In that moment, it becomes clear Helena underwent severance voluntarily as a high-profile demonstration of Lumon’s flagship technology ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=actually%20his%20outie%E2%80%99s%20wife%20Gemma%2C,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)) ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=It%20seems%20that%20while%20Helly%27s,invested%20member%20of%20the%20organization)). Innie Helly’s horrified reaction – she calls severance a lie and describes innies as *“tortured prisoners”* to the assembled crowd – is a direct betrayal of what her outie stands for ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=match%20at%20L210%20Although%20Cobel,result%20in%20some%20sort%20of)).

**Prevailing Theories:**  
- **PR Stunt Gone Wrong:** The most straightforward interpretation (supported by evidence) is that Helena’s stint as “Helly R.” was always a publicity stunt. As an **Eagan**, she has a vested interest in Severance’s success and likely volunteered to be severed to silence skeptics: after all, if the CEO’s own daughter works as a severed employee and *endorses* it, what stronger proof of confidence could there be? Indeed, at the gala we see Helena being celebrated for her commitment to the cause before innie Helly rebels ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=It%20seems%20that%20while%20Helly%27s,invested%20member%20of%20the%20organization)). The theory here is that Helena never anticipated her innie would be so resistant – she viewed the innie as *“not a person”* but rather a temporary puppet to be used for the experiment. This explains her cold refusal to let Helly quit earlier in the season (recorded via video message), essentially commanding her innie to endure whatever it takes.  
- **Eagan Family Power Dynamics:** Some have speculated on a deeper familial motive – perhaps Helena had to prove herself to the family by surviving severance, or even that Kier’s bloodline subjects themselves to the process to fulfill some ritual. However, there’s scant direct evidence of this beyond the cultish reverence we see in Lumon’s culture. The simpler rationale remains: it was a corporate PR exercise first and foremost.

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** The show provides clear evidence of Helly’s identity and intended role. Innie Helly’s discovery that she is an Eagan and her subsequent speech to expose the truth serve as the **climax of Season 1’s conflict** ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=Although%20Cobel%20arrives%20just%20in,result%20in%20some%20sort%20of)). The consequences are likely severe. Given that Helena was about to publicly praise severance, her innie’s hijacked speech is catastrophic for Lumon’s image – and for Helena’s own standing. We can deduce a few likely outcomes consistent with the show’s logic and themes: (1) **Helena will face immense pressure (or punishment) from her family**. Lumon executives might remove her from the severed program entirely or subject her to “correction.” The Season 1 finale already shows Cobel (disguised as Mrs. Selvig) physically confronting Helly to stop her from speaking, warning of “repercussions” ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=match%20at%20L210%20Although%20Cobel,result%20in%20some%20sort%20of)). (2) Helly’s innie may not return to MDR – as one analyst noted, *“from the company’s perspective, letting her back would be irresponsible and dangerous”* ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=match%20at%20L216%20There%27s%20a,to%20be%20answered%20next%20season)). This implies that if Helena remains severed, they could isolate or recondition her innie (for example, in the mysterious testing floor). (3) On the other hand, her innie’s courageous public declaration might spark outside scrutiny. There were witnesses at the gala who heard her claim that severed workers are enslaved. This could plant seeds for the wider world to question Lumon, aligning with *Severance*’s theme of truth coming to light. 

In sum, Helly’s storyline is likely to continue as a **battle of wills between Helena (outie, indoctrinated heir) and Helly (innie, determined to be free)**. The confirmed resolution so far is her identity – she *is* an Eagan ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=actually%20his%20outie%E2%80%99s%20wife%20Gemma%2C,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)) – and the most coherent path forward is that her innie’s actions will either force the Eagans to tighten their grip (perhaps making her a cautionary example) or inadvertently kickstart the downfall of the severance project by exposing its horrors. This duality encapsulates the show’s central tension between corporate loyalty and individual freedom.

## Mark’s Wife, Gemma – Alive as Ms. Casey (Life, Death, and Severance)

**The Mystery:** Mark Scout’s entire motivation for undergoing severance was to escape the grief of losing his wife, Gemma, who supposedly died in a car accident. Yet, in the penultimate episode and finale, we (and Mark’s innie) learn the truth: **Gemma is not dead – she is alive on the severed floor, known to Mark’s innie as the wellness counselor “Ms. Casey.”** This jaw-dropping reveal raises many questions: How did Gemma become a severed employee? Did Lumon orchestrate her faked death? Does Mark’s outie have any inkling? What is Lumon’s intent with her?

**What We Know:** Ms. Casey (played by Dichen Lachman) conducts “wellness sessions,” reciting eerily scripted affirmations about an employee’s outie life. She is emotionally subdued, almost childlike in her lack of personal memories. We discover she has only 107 hours of “lifetime” on the severed clock – meaning she’s brought out for work sparingly, essentially a part-time innie ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%209%2C%20we%20learn,chip%20dividing%20their%20brain%20malfunctions)). After Helly’s suicide attempt, the Board abruptly instructs Cobel to “permanently retire” Ms. Casey, suggesting she’s considered *disposable*. Cobel escorts Ms. Casey down to the off-limits **“testing floor”**, ominously telling her *“You were extraordinary”* – at which point we see the name “Gemma” on Ms. Casey’s file, confirming her identity just before the episode cuts away. Later, during the overtime emergency, Mark’s innie sees a photo of his wife and realizes *“she’s alive!”* ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=When%20Dylan%20activates%20the%20overtime,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)) – the same moment we confirm Gemma and Casey are one and the same.

**Prevailing Theories:**  
- **“Project Gemma” – An Experiment in Reanimation or Memory:** One theory is that Gemma’s death was no accident. Perhaps Lumon either caused the crash or took her body afterward to use as a test subject. The severance chip might be keeping Gemma alive (if she was comatose or brain-damaged) by creating a new persona (Ms. Casey) that can function at work. This would make Gemma’s case a pilot study in whether severance can “revive” someone in a limited capacity. The fact that Ms. Casey is activated only occasionally could imply she’s kept in a suspended state on the testing floor when not working – essentially, **Gemma is Lumon’s guinea pig** for extreme applications of the tech.  
- **Mark as a Control Variable:** Another angle is that Cobel (and Lumon) were closely observing Mark’s grief and Ms. Casey’s interactions as part of a psychological experiment. Harmony Cobel places herself in Mark’s personal life as his “neighbor,” clearly fascinated by his attachment to his dead wife’s memory. Some fans have noted that Cobel’s behavior – e.g. bringing Devon’s baby to visit her senile mother and calling the baby “Kier” – suggests she’s obsessed with life and death and possibly the idea of rebirth. It’s possible Lumon wanted to see if two severed halves (Mark and Gemma) could unknowingly reconnect on a spiritual level. Indeed, Mark and Ms. Casey do share a peculiar, subtle bond at work (a quiet comfort with each other) that Cobel remarks upon: at one point, Cobel pointedly asks Ms. Casey *“How do you feel about Mark Scout?”*, as if looking for signs of recognition. Ms. Casey only replies, *“I feel…nothing,”* highlighting how deeply the severance has wiped Gemma’s original self.

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** The confirmed part of this mystery is that **Gemma’s alive and severed** – an enormous twist that recontextualizes Mark’s arc ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=When%20Dylan%20activates%20the%20overtime,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)). The likely resolution builds on what little evidence we have: Gemma’s condition and treatment imply she is an experiment. Her file, her limited hours, and the Board’s willingness to “dispose” of her indicate she’s not a regular employee but rather a test subject who has outlived her usefulness once the Helly incident occurs. It stands to reason that Lumon *arranged* for Gemma’s current state. Perhaps Gemma was critically injured (hence presumed dead to the outside world) and Lumon offered a deal to use the severance procedure to “save” her – effectively creating Ms. Casey in the process. This would be in line with Lumon’s biotech frontier ethos: they may be exploring memory implantation as a means of keeping someone technically alive but without their original identity. Another supported theory is that **reintegration** will come into play for Gemma. Just as Petey was reintegrated (though imperfectly), Mark may seek to restore Gemma fully. The tragedy is that Mark’s outie has no idea his wife lives, while Mark’s innie knows the truth but has no power outside – a poignant setup that underscores the show’s theme of fractured selves seeking wholeness.

Going forward, a logical development (supported by narrative need and theme) is that Mark will try to reunite with Gemma. The Season 1 finale leaves Mark’s outie shouting “she’s alive!” – presumably alerting his sister and possibly Cobel to the fact that Gemma’s fate is tangled with Lumon ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=match%20at%20L263%20When%20Irving%E2%80%99s,parts%20of%20his%20innie%27s%20life)) ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=match%20at%20L270%20telling%20a,season%20ends%20filled%20with%20suspense)). The most coherent conclusion is that *Severance* will move toward exposing how and why Gemma became Ms. Casey. Expect revelations that **Lumon intervened in Gemma’s “death”**, using her to test severance’s most extreme capabilities (such as resurrecting a person in piecemeal fashion). This directly ties into the show’s larger critique: Lumon not only severs office workers, it literally **commodifies human life and death** for its ends. Mark’s personal quest, then, is likely to collide with Lumon’s agenda – recovering Gemma’s identity would mean unraveling one of Lumon’s darkest secrets. In a show so focused on the value of genuine emotional life, the resolution with Gemma will probably affirm that her true self (and her love with Mark) cannot be erased without consequence.

## The Baby Goats and Other Departmental Oddities

**The Mystery:** Midway through the season, Helly and Mark wander the halls and stumble upon a room filled with **baby goats** being tended by a lone employee. When startled, the man fiercely protects the goats, cryptically saying, *“You can’t take them yet. They’re not ready. It isn’t time.”* ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%205%2C%20Helly%20and,It%20isn%27t%20time)). This scene, utterly out of context, is one of the show’s strangest unanswered questions. Similarly, other departments like Optics & Design (O&D) harbor secrets: O&D initially claims to have only two employees making handbook art, but later we see they had many workers and equipment humming away, implying hidden projects ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=Image%3A%20The%20O%26D%20department%20,Apple%20TV)). And of course, there are the two ominous paintings exchanged between MDR and O&D depicting each department slaughtering the other – apparently propaganda planted by management to keep them apart. What is going on in these less-understood parts of Lumon?

**Prevailing Theories about the Goats:**  
- **Scientific/Biotech Experiment:** The most common speculation is that the goats are part of a biotech experiment, possibly related to the severance chips or even human subjects. In pharmaceuticals and biotech, goats are sometimes used to produce antibodies or as test animals; some fans think these goats could be genetically altered or implanted with something Lumon needs. The caretaker’s warning *“they’re not ready”* suggests the goats are growing or maturing towards some purpose. Could they be hosts for human consciousness (a wild theory), or being used to incubate organic material for the chips? While no direct evidence in Season 1 confirms this, the idea fits Lumon’s profile as a “biotechnology corporation” ([Hide and Seek (Severance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_and_Seek_(Severance)#:~:text=The%20series%20follows%20employees%20of,begins%20to%20establish%20stricter%20measures)) and their penchant for *literalizing* metaphors (e.g. the four tempers represented physically). In Kier’s lore, *Malice* was symbolized by a ram ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)) – notably a goat-like creature – which raises the eyebrow that a room of young goats sits hidden in Lumon’s depths. Perhaps it’s symbolic, or perhaps those goats are being groomed as part of Lumon’s pursuit of taming “malice” or some such concept.  
- **Distraction or Psychological Test:** Another theory is that the goat room is intentionally absurd – a non sequitur designed to test employees’ reactions or to mislead outsiders. It’s so outlandish that even Mark is doubtful when Helly suggests the goats might relate to their work ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=There%27s%20no%20explanation%20whatsoever)). If Lumon’s goal is to observe the severed workers under all sorts of stimuli, introducing random elements like a room of goats could gauge their curiosity or compliance. The fact that it’s never explained to MDR could be deliberate: it keeps them off-balance.

**O&D and Other Departments:** O&D’s hidden workforce and the **“coup” paintings** imply Lumon segregates its departments to prevent employees pooling knowledge. Burt (O&D head) eventually admits they actually have **“many employees working like busy bees”** on tasks beyond just painting pictures ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=Image%3A%20The%20O%26D%20department%20,Apple%20TV)). This indicates each severed department might be working on separate pieces of a larger puzzle, kept ignorant of each other. The fake paintings of inter-department massacres were revealed to be propaganda (different versions shown to each team) to instill fear ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=Could%20the%20pictures%20mean%20that%2C,Season%202%20tells%20us%20more)). This tactic serves Lumon’s interest by preventing collaboration. It’s strongly implied that **the departments together might uncover Lumon’s grand design if they compared notes**, hence the need to keep them siloed.

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** The baby goats remain, by the end of Season 1, an **intentional enigma** – even the characters have “no rational idea” what they’re seeing ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=What%20on%20Earth%20is%20going,has%20any%20rational%20idea%20yet)). The showrunners have left this as one of the surreal mysteries to pay off later. Given the evidence, a likely resolution will tie the goats into Lumon’s bio-experiments. Perhaps the goats are being injected with something (maybe *“severed” themselves in some way) or are producing a substance needed for the chips. The key evidence is the caretaker’s urgency: *“They’re not ready. It isn’t time.”* ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%205%2C%20Helly%20and,It%20isn%27t%20time)) – implying that at a specific time, something will be done with or to these goats. That kind of phrasing is often used for either **scheduled experiments** or **rituals**. Considering the cultish undertones at Lumon, it could even be both (a scientific ritual). Thematically, it wouldn’t be surprising if Lumon’s quest to control human nature crosses into grotesque territory – possibly even trying to blur lines between human and animal (as a metaphor for dehumanization). 

For O&D and other departments, the likely resolution is more straightforward: Season 2 and beyond will probably reveal what each department actually produces and how it feeds Lumon’s master plan. We’ve already gathered that O&D is involved in manufacturing Lumon propaganda (handbook kits, paintings) *and* something else on a larger scale (they had maps and equipment suggesting they also map the building or work on hardware). The **Optics** in O&D might hint at surveillance or perception management. Similarly, the goats could belong to a department (some fans dub it the “Goat Department”) with a specific research focus. **In sum, these oddities are pieces of world-building that point to Lumon conducting wide-ranging experiments (psychological, technological, and biological)** under one roof. The most coherent explanation is simply that a company as powerful and secretive as Lumon will have many such projects – baby animals, bizarre art, brainwashing tapes – all serving the endgame of perfecting severance and whatever societal control it’s aiming for. Season 1 lays the groundwork by showing us these uncanny fragments; the resolution will come as the characters (and thus we) connect these fragments to the central plot of severance. Until then, the baby goats remain a symbol of *Severance*’s uncanny atmosphere – an unresolved riddle that teases the breadth of Lumon’s machinations.

## Rituals, Cults, and Kier Eagan’s Legacy

**The Mystery:** From the perpetually smiling Kier Eagan statues to the bizarre Waffle Party, *Severance* paints Lumon as more than a company – it’s a cult of personality and philosophy. The employees follow a **“Compliance Handbook”** full of quasi-scriptural aphorisms. They celebrate seemingly innocuous milestones (music dance breaks, melon bars, waffle parties) that carry strange undertones. The Waffle Party, in particular, starts as a goofy reward (eat all the waffles you want) and turns into a fetishistic ceremony: one refiner (Dylan) dons a Kier Eagan head mask and sits on a bed while figures wearing the four tempers’ masks perform a suggestive dance around him ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=expression.%20,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)). Harmony Cobel herself maintains a shrine to Kier in her house and engages in secret rituals (like using Mark’s sister’s baby in a weird devotional moment). All of this begs the question: **Is Lumon essentially a cult, and what role does Kier’s legacy play in the present?** Is Kier (the long-deceased founder) somehow still exerting influence – metaphorically or even literally?

**Prevailing Theories:**  
- **Kier Eagan as a Deified Figure:** Clearly, Kier is treated as if he’s omnipresent. The employees pray to his principles, and myths abound of his exploits (taming the tempers, pardoning betrayals, etc.). One theory is that the Eagan family deliberately runs Lumon *as a cult*, using Kier’s mythology to enforce loyalty. The reverence is a tool: employees (especially upper management like Cobel) who buy in will treat the company’s mission with religious fervor. This theory is strongly supported by the show’s content – from the perpetuity museum with wax dioramas of Kier’s life, to daily oaths and quotes the employees recite. Even the fact that Helly is **an Eagan** shows the family line is still deeply involved in the company’s day-to-day. They are, in effect, a dynastic cult leadership.  
- **The Board and Kier – Possible Continuation:** A more far-fetched idea (but one some fans contemplate) is that Kier Eagan isn’t entirely “gone.” Perhaps his consciousness, or at least his exacting doctrine, lives on through the Board or some AI. When Helly’s outie remarks that Kier *“appears entirely alive, contrary to what we’ve been told,”* ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=thus%20far,to%20what%20we%27ve%20been%20told)) it’s likely a figurative expression of how present his persona is – though it momentarily sparks the notion: could the Board (which speaks through a distorted intercom and never shows their faces) be literally Kier’s preserved mind or descendants enacting his will? No concrete evidence in Season 1 confirms a sci-fi resurrection of Kier, but the *feeling* of his presence is deliberately kept strong. For now, it’s safer to say the Board are probably living Eagans or loyalists rather than ghosts of Kier.

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** The *cult* aspect is well-evidenced. Lumon’s corporate culture mimics religion: daily mantras in the Break Room (*“I forgive you for the harm you have caused this world”* repeated endlessly), the reverence of artifacts (e.g. Kier’s actual book or handprints), and the promise of existential reward (the employees are told if they’re dutiful, they’ll reach the “Last Tier” and meet Kier in some afterlife-like scenario). These aren’t typical office HR policies – they’re indoctrination. The Waffle Party is a tangible piece of evidence for how surreal and ritualistic things have become: the masks worn by the dancers correspond to Kier’s four tempers, essentially turning a simple reward into a reenactment of Kier’s philosophical victory over human weakness ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=expression.%20,is%20represented%20by%20a%20ram)) ([Four Tempers | Severance Wiki | Fandom](https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Four_Tempers#:~:text=The%20Kier%20Cycle%20oil%20painting,woman%20in%20a%20bridal%20dress)). This indicates the upper echelons at Lumon stage these rituals to honor Kier’s legacy and possibly to subconsciously influence the participants (Dylan was noticeably uncomfortable and distracted by the strange erotic pageant, which gave him the chance to escape and trigger the overtime contingency).

The likely resolution regarding Lumon’s cultism is that it’s part of how the company maintains power. As the innies become more self-aware, they may start to see the absurdity of these customs and reject them (as Helly’s innie already did vocally). We can expect that the **Eagan family’s intentions** will be further unveiled – possibly revealing that Kier’s writings (like the “four tempers”) are the blueprint for all of Lumon’s projects. The show sets up Kier Eagan as a quasi-mythic figure whose shadow looms over everything; the payoff might involve discovering something literal, like a secret vault (maybe on the testing floor) where Kier’s original experiments or even his preserved body/mind reside. At the very least, we will see the **modern Eagans (Jame Eagan, Helena, etc.) doubling down on Kier’s dogma** in response to the rebellion. In a thematic sense, the resolution here is not just plot-based but emotional: the cult-like control is meant to break people’s individuality, and the series is clearly moving toward individuals (Mark, Helly, Irving, Dylan) reclaiming their sense of self. Therefore, dismantling the Kier cult—symbolically slaying the “false god” of Lumon—may be necessary for our protagonists to truly gain freedom. The evidence thus far (the increasingly blatant parallels to religion) suggests that *Severance* will ultimately cast a critical eye on fanaticism and inherited power. The innies forming their own community (across departments) and trusting each other is the antithesis of the Kier worship meant to isolate them – a narrative trajectory that mirrors **overcoming cult indoctrination**. In concrete terms, we anticipate Season 2 will directly confront the Eagan family and possibly expose the Board, shedding light on how much of Kier’s myth is real versus manufactured. The show’s commitment to “evidence-backed” storytelling implies we’ll get a logical unraveling of the cult – showing us *why* these rituals existed and how they served Lumon’s scientific goals (for example, did the Waffle Party have a psychological purpose, or was it pure religious homage?). 

In summary, Lumon’s cultish veneer is not just window-dressing; it’s a key to understanding the stakes. The unresolved mystery of Kier’s true legacy will likely resolve with a clearer picture of what the Eagans really believe **severance** can achieve – perhaps nothing short of a perfected human soul, which in Kier’s eyes would make him almost a savior figure. That grandiose aim, once revealed, will tie together the personal and philosophical conflicts driving the series.

## Irving’s Visions and the Dark Secrets of the “Testing Floor”

**The Mystery:** Irving (MDR’s most senior employee) experiences unsettling hallucinations at work – black oil-like drips seeping from the ceiling and visions of a long dark corridor. Outside of work, Irving’s outie is revealed to obsessively paint the same corridor over and over, and he has a trunk full of documents hinting at an off-hours investigation into Lumon ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%209%2C%20we%20learn,chip%20dividing%20their%20brain%20malfunctions)) ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=It%20could%20also%20explain%20why,and%20what%20evidence%20he%20has)). In the finale, innie Irving uses his brief freedom to drive to the home of Burt (his O&D friend/lover), suggesting Irving’s outie discovered Burt’s identity and address. All signs point to Irving having a unique connection to Lumon’s darker recesses – notably the mysterious “testing floor,” which we haven’t seen but has been ominously referenced.

**What We Know:** Irving’s outie life gives crucial context: he’s a military veteran (U.S. Navy) and lives a regimented, solitary life, listening to war hymns and working on his paintings ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=match%20at%20L263%20When%20Irving%E2%80%99s,parts%20of%20his%20innie%27s%20life)). The fact he continuously paints **Lumon’s testing floor hallway** (a place his innie has only briefly seen when escorting Ms. Casey) implies a bleed-through of memory or at least subconscious impression ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=match%20at%20L263%20When%20Irving%E2%80%99s,parts%20of%20his%20innie%27s%20life)). Additionally, Irving keeps a map or list of Lumon employees’ addresses at home, indicating that he (his outie) is actively researching his colleagues or perhaps looking for former employees. On Lumon’s end, we know Irving has been severed longer than his peers and is exceptionally indoctrinated (quoting the handbook and defending the company line early on). However, his loyalty falters once Burt is forced to retire, prompting Irving to join the others’ rebellion plan ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=match%20at%20L301%20Irving%E2%80%99s%20innie,his%20outie%20has%20a%20child)).

**Prevailing Theories:**  
- **Severance Side-Effects (Cognitive Leak):** The most plausible explanation for Irving’s visions is that the severance implant isn’t perfect. Irving’s hallucinations of black fluid could be a neurological glitch – possibly his brain trying to reconcile the two lives. As Looper’s analysis notes, these *“horrifying visions”* might be chip malfunctions from his unusually long tenure ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%209%2C%20we%20learn,chip%20dividing%20their%20brain%20malfunctions)). It’s as if his brain knows something dark (the black paint) that his conscious mind can’t contextualize. Supporting this, the black corridor he paints is very real – it’s the elevator route to the testing floor – so at some level, Irving’s mind retained that imagery. This suggests the barrier between his innie and outie has hairline cracks, leaking impressions (in this case, fear associated with the testing floor, represented by dripping black substance) ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%209%2C%20we%20learn,chip%20dividing%20their%20brain%20malfunctions)).  
- **Personal Vendetta or Mission:** Another theory is that Irving’s outie might have gotten severed for the *purpose* of investigating Lumon from the inside. It’s curious that outie Irving has all those Lumon-related files. Perhaps as a veteran or someone who lost a loved one to severance, he severed himself to infiltrate the company, and his meticulous note-taking and painting is his way of cataloguing what his innie experiences (even if he can’t directly remember, he might see the paintings he himself made while “out”). While speculative, this would cast Irving’s goofy rule-following innie in a new light – he could unknowingly be part of a larger plan by his outie. The evidence for this is subtle: the fact that Irving immediately set out to find Burt upon being woken up outside indicates his outie knew exactly where to go. He had Burt’s address, meaning he identified Burt’s outie at some point. This level of info suggests deliberate sleuthing by outie Irving ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=In%20Episode%209%2C%20we%20learn,chip%20dividing%20their%20brain%20malfunctions)) ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=It%20could%20also%20explain%20why,and%20what%20evidence%20he%20has)).

**Evidence & Likely Resolution:** Season 1 provides pieces of evidence that Irving’s experiences are central to uncovering Lumon’s worst deeds. The **Testing Floor** is a term loaded with dread – Ms. Casey’s removal there implies it’s where severed employees who are “retired” or experimented on end up. Irving’s fixation on that hallway in his art means he’s haunted by it. The likely resolution is two-fold: (1) We will learn what happens on the testing floor (be it reintegration experiments, memory wipes, or storage of inert innies). Given Irving’s clues, it could be something harrowing – perhaps where employees who “die” inside are kept, or where the severed consciousness goes when not in use (as possibly with Gemma). (2) Irving will confront the outcome of Burt’s “retirement.” It’s ambiguous if Burt’s outie simply quit or if something sinister was done to him. Irving finding Burt’s home could reveal whether Burt remembers Irving (if Burt was unsuspended and reintegrated normally, his outie would have no idea; if something else happened, there may be a twist). The emotional drive is clear: Irving, the rule follower, is now driven by love to break the rules. This is likely to bring him face-to-face with the testing floor because that’s the one place connected to both his trauma (the visions) and his motivation (possibly finding what happened to Ms. Casey or ensuring Burt is okay).

Given the evidence, the most coherent explanation is that Irving’s brain has been resisting the severance boundaries. The “black rain” vision could symbolize his latent dread – a temper Kier said needed taming – seeping through. In a show so carefully crafted, that image is no random scare: it’s tied to Lumon’s core secrets. Therefore, we anticipate that the resolution of Irving’s mystery will involve him (and maybe the other rebels) **literally descending into Lumon’s depths (the testing floor)** to uncover whatever darkness the company is hiding. Whether his outie had a premeditated agenda or not, by Season 2 he effectively *has* an agenda: expose Lumon’s lies, partly to protect the man he cares for. This personal stake ensures that Irving will be our guide into the heart of Lumon’s darkness. As for the severance side-effects angle, that serves as a cautionary note: it proves that the technology is flawed and that memories and emotions can’t be neatly partitioned – a key theme mirrored in every character (e.g. Petey’s reintegration sickness, Mark’s lingering melancholy). Irving’s case provides scientific plausibility within the narrative that severance can fail. The likely outcome is that Irving’s unraveling will furnish proof (perhaps via a medical perspective) that severance causes neurological damage, further bolstering the case against Lumon. In summary, Irving’s visions and the testing floor are two sides of the same coin: both point to the **inhuman lengths Lumon will go to in order to achieve its aims**, and both will likely be pivotal in Season 2’s drive toward revealing and hopefully dismantling those practices.

# Parallels with Other Fictional Works

*Severance* is a unique blend, but it draws on a rich tradition of speculative fiction about identity, control, and corporate dystopia. The show’s creators have acknowledged inspiration from or resonance with several earlier works. Below, we compare *Severance* to a few notable examples, focusing only on comparisons backed by at least three specific connections in themes or content.

## *Severance* and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* (2004)

Michel Gondry’s film *Eternal Sunshine* explores a procedure that selectively erases memories of a painful relationship. There are clear parallels between this and *Severance*’s premise:

- **Memory Removal to Alleviate Pain:** In *Eternal Sunshine*, Joel undergoes the procedure to forget his ex-girlfriend and ease his heartbreak. Mark undergoes severance to escape the pain of his wife’s death ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=Scott%20leads%20the%20cast%20as,more%20sinister%20motivations%20behind%20Lumon)) ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=When%20Dylan%20activates%20the%20overtime,he%20presumes%20to%20be%20dead)). Both works revolve around using technology to cope with grief by literally removing the memories of that grief (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=played%20by%C2%A0Jim%20Carrey%E2%80%94navigates%20a%20snowy,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=erase%20a%20specific%20heartbreaking%20relationship,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)).  
- **Unintended Consequences:** Both stories reveal that erasing pain isn’t a true solution. In *Eternal Sunshine*, as Joel’s memories are erased, his subconscious resists and he realizes he doesn’t want to forget his love. In *Severance*, Mark’s “cure” is incomplete – his outie is numb, but his innie still experiences emptiness, and ultimately, neither part of him actually processes the loss. This underscores a shared theme: the resilience of emotional truth. As the Peabody analysis notes, *Severance* and *Eternal Sunshine* both show that attempts to control memory *“isn’t always so easy”* and can backfire (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=played%20by%C2%A0Jim%20Carrey%E2%80%94navigates%20a%20snowy,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=to%20control%20memory%20for%20their,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)).  
- **Ethical Implications of Memory Tech:** Both works use their sci-fi device to raise ethical questions. In *Eternal Sunshine*, there’s an implicit critique of whether doctors should tamper with memories at all, and we see fallout (e.g. a technician uses the procedure to take advantage of a patient). *Severance* takes this further in a corporate context: innies are essentially a by-product of someone editing their own mind for convenience. The ethical dilemma – is it right to “delete” part of yourself? – is central to both. While *Eternal Sunshine* has a more romantic, hopeful tone in the end, *Severance* is darker, yet both caution against the notion that we can simply cut out the bad without losing something essential of ourselves (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=played%20by%C2%A0Jim%20Carrey%E2%80%94navigates%20a%20snowy,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=to%20control%20memory%20for%20their,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)).

In short, *Severance* can be seen as *Eternal Sunshine*’s concept applied to the workplace and taken to an extreme. The proven connections are the concept of memory erasure for emotional management, the narrative that personal pain finds a way back, and the moral that living with even painful memories is part of being human (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=played%20by%C2%A0Jim%20Carrey%E2%80%94navigates%20a%20snowy,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=to%20control%20memory%20for%20their,finale%20to%20know%20for%20sure)).

## *Severance* and *Lost* (2004–2010)

Though very different in setting, *Severance* has often been compared to the TV series *Lost* for its mystery-box storytelling and thematic depth. The comparison isn’t just surface-level; there are substantial parallels:

- **Mysterious Organization & Experiments:** *Lost* featured the Dharma Initiative, a secretive group running bizarre experiments on an island, often involving psychological and electromagnetic tests on unwitting subjects. Likewise, *Severance* has Lumon, a secretive corporation conducting unethical experiments on its employees’ minds. Both stories gradually peel back layers to reveal what these organizations are up to. For example, early *Lost* episodes showed characters pushing a button in a hatch without knowing why (much like MDR refiners sorting numbers without context) – later revealed to be a psychological experiment *and* a real failsafe. *Severance* mirrors this blend of **psychological manipulation with real stakes**, as the workers perform tasks that might be both tests and functional operations.  
- **Character-Centric Mystery and Backstory Reveals:** Both series emphasize character development through unveiling their past or outside lives piece by piece. *Lost* pioneered the use of flashbacks (and later flash-forwards) to show who the characters were before the island, directly affecting how we interpret their actions. *Severance* essentially embeds this structure into its premise: the *“outside world”* sequences act as flashbacks that gradually inform us about Mark, Helly, Irving, and Dylan’s true selves. Each reveal (Gemma’s fate, Helly’s identity, Irving’s investigations, Dylan’s child) recontextualizes the character just as, say, learning John Locke was in a wheelchair recontextualized him in *Lost*. This narrative technique – unfolding backstory to solve mysteries – is a shared DNA (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20hard%20not%20to%20think,know%20for%20the%20story%20at)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=hand,saving%20power%20of%20community)). The Peabody Awards commentary even called *Severance* *“Lost in an office”* due to its surreal mysteries (like the goats) and focus on a core group with hidden connections (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20hard%20not%20to%20think,know%20for%20the%20story%20at)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=hand,saving%20power%20of%20community)).  
- **Themes of Community and Sacrifice:** Despite *Severance*’s corporate coldness and *Lost*’s supernatural island, both ultimately stress human connection. *Lost* repeatedly showed that survival depended on the castaways coming together and often sacrificing for one another, encapsulated in the famous line “live together, die alone.” In *Severance*, the four MDR team members (and their O&D friends) form a bond in defiance of the system – they choose trust and solidarity over isolation. Their plan to expose Lumon requires personal risk and sacrifice (Dylan literally giving up his freedom in that closet to hold the switches, Irving risking his hopes with Burt, Helly endangering herself to tell the truth) ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=match%20at%20L301%20Irving%E2%80%99s%20innie,his%20outie%20has%20a%20child)) ([How Did 'Severance' Season 1 End? All About the Cliffhanger Ending](https://people.com/severance-season-1-ending-explained-8773684#:~:text=Irving%E2%80%99s%20innie%20loves%20the%20company%2C,his%20outie%20has%20a%20child)). This echoes *Lost*’s ethos. Critics have noted that *Severance*, like *Lost*, believes in *“the life-saving power of community”* and *“the heroism of sacrifice for others”* (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=hand,saving%20power%20of%20community)). Both shows counteract their mysteries and conspiracies with a deeply humanist message: people need each other to find meaning and break free from fear.

These parallels are more than coincidental. Series creator Dan Erickson has cited shows like *Lost* as influential in proving that complex, weird mysteries can thrive on TV, and *Severance* consciously “learned some lessons” from *Lost* – such as maintaining focus on character and giving just enough answers to keep the story coherent (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=to%C2%A0Lost%E2%80%94a%20game,our%20personal%20lives%2C%20particularly%20the)). The three major connections – secret experiments, structural storytelling techniques, and core themes – make *Lost* a fitting comparison that informs *Severance*’s content and approach (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20hard%20not%20to%20think,know%20for%20the%20story%20at)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=hand,saving%20power%20of%20community)).

## *Severance* and *Portal* (2007 video game)

Perhaps surprisingly, a first-person puzzle video game shares some of the most concrete and specific parallels with *Severance*. Valve’s *Portal* is about a woman (Chell) trapped in the sterile Aperture Science facility, forced to undergo tests by an AI overseer. The Peabody Awards analysis drew multiple one-to-one comparisons between *Portal* and *Severance*, including:

- **Waking in a Confined Lab with a Dissonant Guide:** *Portal* begins with Chell waking in an unfamiliar testing chamber, greeted by the disembodied voice of GLaDOS giving orientation instructions. *Severance* similarly opens with Helly awakening disoriented on the conference table, with a disembodied voice (Milchick via intercom, and later Cobel) conducting her orientation (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=who%20at%20times%20admits%20to,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)). In both cases, the protagonist is being treated as a test subject from the first moment, and the voice presents as polite/tutorial while concealing the true stakes. The staging of Helly’s opening scene – alone in a minimalist room, answering bizarre questions from an unseen evaluator – is strikingly similar to *Portal*’s tone and setup (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=who%20at%20times%20admits%20to,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)).  
- **Unknown Identity and Desire to Escape:** Chell in *Portal* is essentially anonymous; we know nothing of her backstory or who she is, and she’s defined by her actions trying to escape the facility. Helly, especially initially, also has no identity (even to herself, since her innie has no memories). Her entire arc in Season 1 is attempting escape – through the halls, via resignation requests, even by self-harm – much like how the player’s goal in *Portal* is to break free of Aperture’s tests. Both Helly and Chell demonstrate resourcefulness and defiance. Notably, the *Portal* tagline “The cake is a lie” (graffiti revealing that the promised reward is a sham) finds a dark echo in *Severance*: the **“Waffle Party”** is real cake (or waffles) but comes with a disturbing ritual attached (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=begins%20similar%20to%20the%20way,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=speaker%20youtu,has%20not%20come%20to%20fruition)). In *Portal*, GLaDOS dangles cake as a reward for compliance; in *Severance*, Lumon dangles incentives like waffle parties or melon bars to encourage productivity. Both works show these “rewards” to be manipulative tools. (The Peabody piece cleverly notes that *Portal*’s promised cake is fake, whereas *Severance*’s waffles exist but *“the party isn’t what you expect.”* (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=begins%20similar%20to%20the%20way,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)))  
- **Unreliable Authority and Restricted Information:** GLaDOS in *Portal* constantly lies or omits truth to keep Chell under control, providing only information that serves the experiment. Similarly, Lumon management (Cobel, Milchick, the handbook) only tell the severed employees what will keep them working. Mark and team are never told what their work means ([Biggest Unanswered Questions From Severance Season 1](https://www.looper.com/830807/biggest-unanswered-questions-from-severance-season-1/#:~:text=Despite%20this%20apparently%20simple%20description%2C,people%20for%20their%20own%20benefit)), and any time they probe, they’re stonewalled – much like how GLaDOS deflects Chell’s questions or attempts at reasoning. The vibe of moving through sterile test chambers in *Portal*, with no context except the AI’s instructions, is mirrored by MDR moving from one imposed task to the next under the watchful eye of Cobel’s surveillance. Even aesthetically, Lumon’s white corridors and retro-modern terminals evoke a test environment. Another fun detail: *Portal* and *Severance* both employ **dark humor** via their authority figures. GLaDOS makes dry, sinister jokes at the player’s expense; Cobel and Milchick likewise often maintain an unsettling cheeriness and corporate jargon that contrasts with the horror of what they’re doing (e.g. Milchick turning a violent security breach into a peppy “Music Dance Experience”). This tonal similarity underscores the parallel commentary on corporate/AI soullessness.

With these specific points of connection – the opening scenario, the escape motif with false rewards, and the dynamic of a manipulative overseer – it’s evident that *Portal* informed *Severance*. In fact, Ben Stiller and Dan Erickson have acknowledged knowing the comparison; Erickson even devised Helly’s opening scene without realizing the *Portal* resemblance until others pointed it out, at which point he welcomed the parallel as fitting (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=who%20at%20times%20admits%20to,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)). The show doubles down on it with cheeky nods (waffles vs. cake). All told, *Severance* can be seen as a narrative, human-character-driven take on *Portal*’s core scenario: a person in a maze of experiments fighting against an inhuman system for freedom (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=who%20at%20times%20admits%20to,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=begins%20similar%20to%20the%20way,A%20film%20version%20has%20been)).

## *Severance* and Workplace Satire (*The Office*, *Office Space*, etc.)

Beyond sci-fi parallels, *Severance* is deeply rooted in workplace satire. It often feels like a darker mirror to comedies like *The Office* or the cult film *Office Space*, and this is by design:

- **Banal Office Culture Turned Absurd:** *Severance* exaggerates real corporate quirks – zealous team-building, emblems of the “employee of the month,” awkward elevator small talk – by placing them in an extreme setting. For example, the office perks in *Severance* (finger traps for good work, waffle parties, dance breaks) are humorous in the same way *The Office*’s pointless meetings or *Office Space*’s TPS reports are: they highlight the emptiness of corporate morale boosters. Ben Stiller noted the show *“was based in [a] comedic structure of an office workplace comedy”* when he first read the script (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=Severance%E2%80%98s%20executive%20producer%20and%20director%C2%A0Ben,And%2C%20yes%2C%20Stiller%2C%20too%2C%20sees%C2%A0Zach)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=episode%E2%80%99s%20script%20as%20a%20writing,workplace%20sitcoms%2C%C2%A0Parks%20and%20Recreation%2C%20made)). This is evidenced by many scenes in Season 1 that could almost be from a sitcom if not for the sinister context – like a cringe-worthy team camaraderie exercise or Mark’s inept boss act when Helly arrives.  
- **Characters as Office Archetypes with a Twist:** Dylan, for instance, provides comic relief with his impish enthusiasm for incentives and rivalry with O&D, akin to a Dwight Schrute from *The Office* (overzealous about company lore) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=episode%E2%80%99s%20script%20as%20a%20writing,Dwight%20Schrute%20of%20this%20office)). In fact, Stiller explicitly likened Dylan to a bizarre version of Dwight (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=Reporter%20www,Dwight%20Schrute%20of%20this%20office)). The show uses these familiar archetypes – the jaded veteran (Irving, a twist on the know-it-all employee), the newcomer who shakes things up (Helly, much like a new hire in any office comedy causing disruption), the eccentric middle-manager (Milchick with his fixed grin could be seen as an extreme HR rep). By grounding the characters in recognizable types, *Severance* invites comparison to workplace comedies, only to subvert it when, say, a break-room reprimand turns into psychological torture. This combination of the mundane and the macabre is a hallmark of *Severance*’s tone.  
- **Commentary on Work-Life Balance:** Comedies like *Office Space* famously satirize the dehumanizing routine of cubicle life and the desire to reclaim one’s life from one’s job. *Severance* takes that premise – *“I wish I could leave work at work”* – and gives it a science fiction literalism. The core satire is that splitting your work and personal life isn’t actually healthy; it creates basically a new person condemned to eternal office hell. This is an implicit critique of work culture taken to extremes, just as *The Office* or *Dilbert* cartoon strip exaggerate office absurdities for humor. Dan Erickson drew from his own monotonic office jobs in writing *Severance*, channeling those experiences into the show’s absurd procedures (like macrodata refiners celebrating quarterly quotas they don’t understand, much as real employees celebrate largely meaningless corporate targets). The fundamental disconnect the severance procedure creates is a form of dark comedy: Mark’s outie drinks away his evenings in misery, while his innie is forced into forced gaiety at a “Music Dance Experience.” This split is an on-the-nose satire of how companies expect workers to shelve personal problems and be cheerfully productive – *Severance* just makes it literal.

The connections here are more thematic, but nonetheless specific in execution – many critics describe *Severance* as *“The Office meets Black Mirror”* because it so clearly invokes the tropes of the modern workplace to ground its sci-fi concept (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=Severance%C2%A0is%20somehow%20unlike%20anything%20you%E2%80%99ve,Cobel%2C%20shades)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=familiar%20%28and%20excellent%29%20influences,as%20an%20inspiration%2C%20and%20Terry)). In evidence, we have the creators’ own words and the Peabody essay noting how scenes like the melon bar party are straight out of an office satire playbook (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=Severance%C2%A0is%20somehow%20unlike%20anything%20you%E2%80%99ve,Cobel%2C%20shades)) (['Severance' Is 'Lost' Meets 'The Office' Plus So Much More - The Peabody Awards](https://peabodyawards.com/stories/severance-is-lost-meets-the-office/#:~:text=familiar%20%28and%20excellent%29%20influences,as%20an%20inspiration%2C%20and%20Terry)). By understanding *Severance* in the context of workplace comedies, we appreciate how it both honors and twists that genre: the jokes are there (quietly), but each punchline has a horror stinger. This blend amplifies the show’s critique of dehumanizing workplaces far more effectively than comedy or drama alone could.

In the latest episode of "Severance," titled "Sweet Vitriol," significant developments unfold, particularly concerning Harmony Cobel's past and her intricate ties to Lumon Industries. Cobel revisits her hometown, Salt's Neck, a once-thriving company town now in decline due to Lumon's actions. This journey reveals Cobel's deep-seated connections to Lumon, including her family's history and her own pivotal role in the severance procedure's inception. It's unveiled that Cobel was the original architect of the severance process, an idea later appropriated by Jame Eagan, Lumon's current CEO.

This revelation adds complexity to Cobel's character, highlighting her transformation from a loyal Lumon executive to someone grappling with the company's ethical boundaries. Patricia Arquette, who portrays Cobel, discusses this evolution, noting her character's growing awareness of Lumon's dangerous nature and her own dispensability within the corporate hierarchy.

These insights into Cobel's background not only deepen the narrative but also challenge viewers to reconsider her motivations and the broader implications of Lumon's practices.
