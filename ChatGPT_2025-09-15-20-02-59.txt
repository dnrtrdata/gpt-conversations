I want a list of the 5 top rated single-player games on Metacritic for each respective year from 2007 until present day.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


I can definitely help compile the top‚Äërated single‚Äëplayer games on Metacritic from 2007 to the present‚Äîbut it's a fairly involved task. To ensure accuracy, here's what I‚Äôd need to do:

For each year 2007 through 2025, identify the top 5 single-player (non-multiplayer) games based on Metascore.

Verify via Metacritic (or reliable archives) each game‚Äôs score and release year.

Present the results in a clear tabular format.

Because this spans nearly two decades, I‚Äôll gather and verify each year‚Äôs data step-by-step via web searches to ensure completeness and reliability.

Before diving in:

Should I proceed with that full year-by-year breakdown from 2007 to 2025?

Would you prefer me to start with a few years‚Äîsay 2007‚Äì2010‚Äîas a sample, then expand if it meets your needs?

Just let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Below is a year-by-year snapshot of the five highest-scoring single-player (or primarily single-player) releases on Metacritic from 2007 through mid-2025.
Games are listed in rank order for each year (highest Metascore first); remasters/expansions are noted where applicable.

Quick take

From Nintendo‚Äôs Super Mario Galaxy (2007) to the Switch 2 ‚Äúdirector‚Äôs cuts‚Äù of The Legend of Zelda in 2025, the top of Metacritic‚Äôs charts reveals three clear trends:

Nintendo and Rockstar dominance. A Mario or Zelda entry tops four different years, while GTA IV, Red Dead Redemption, and Red Dead Redemption 2 headline 2008, 2010 and 2018.

The RPG revival. Starting with Mass Effect 2 (2010), deep single-player RPGs (Skyrim, Persona 5 Royal, Disco Elysium ‚Äì Final Cut, Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3) appear almost every year.

Modern remasters keep re-earning spots. The Last of Us (2014 remaster, 2020 sequel, 2025 PS5 remaster) and Zelda‚Äôs 2025 4K ports show how re-releases can still command top scores and mindshare.

How I filtered for ‚Äúsingle-player‚Äù

Metacritic‚Äôs raw lists include purely multiplayer titles (Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, etc.). When such games appeared in the annual top-five, I skipped them in favor of the next highest-scoring game with a substantive single-player campaign or story mode. Expansion packs (Blood and Wine, Shadow of the Erdtree) were counted when they review as standalone products with their own Metascores.

Enjoy the backlog hunting‚Äî95 critically acclaimed adventures should keep you busy for quite a while!

How the picks were made

Gameplay: rewarded titles that pushed mechanical design, feel, or systemic depth to new heights for that year.

Immersion: favoured games whose world-building, narrative delivery, and emotional resonance drew players in most completely.

In several years a single game excelled at both (e.g., Elden Ring, Breath of the Wild). For variety I spotlighted a different title in each column whenever another contender provided an equally lauded but distinct strength.

User:


Provide a summary of each game but -- and this is the tricky part -- make sure there is a shared vocabulary for how the games are described so that aspects of them can later be compared on an apples-to-apples level of characteristic similarity. This vocabulary should put every game on an even level of description and identical traits should be considered (meaning the number of traits will have to be very large to apply to so many games made over such a large time frame).

How to compare later

Because every game now shares exactly the same descriptor keys, you can:

Sort or filter by any trait (e.g., all Platformers with Challenging difficulty).

Quantify trends‚Äîcount how many Open-World settings appeared per console cycle.

Evaluate overlaps (e.g., which Stylised + Orchestral combinations score 90+).

Feel free to copy this grid into a spreadsheet or ask me to export a CSV for deeper analytics!

The Last of Us counters with grounded tension: resource scarcity, reactive enemy AI, and Gustavo Santaolalla‚Äôs mournful score fuse into a heart-wrenching trek across ruined America.

2007

Super Mario Galaxy ‚Äî released in 2007 and developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo ‚Äî is a stylised, 3rd-person Platformer whose Subgenre_Tags are 3D, Puzzle-Platform, and Collect-a-thon. Set in a Surreal cosmic playground, it follows a Linear Narrative_Structure yet leverages the Core_Gameplay_Verbs Jump, Spin, and Gravitate inside a Core_Loop that has you explore micro-planets, gather Stars, and unlock ever-larger galaxies. The Difficulty curve is Approachable, its Length_Category is Medium, and it offers Low Player_Agency, all wrapped in a Light-hearted Emotional_Tone supported by a lush Orchestral Audio_Approach. The headline Innovation_Highlight‚Äî360¬∞ planetoid gravity that redefines 3-D platforming‚Äîpairs with Immersion_Drivers rooted in precise Physics and memorable Music, securing the game a spot in the 90+ MetaScore_Band.

BioShock ‚Äî also a 2007 release, crafted by Irrational Games ‚Äî presents a Stylised, 1st-Person Shooter blended with Immersive-Sim and Survival-Horror Subgenre_Tags. Its Post-Apocalypse (undersea) Setting of Rapture unfolds through a Linear Narrative_Structure, but the Core_Gameplay_Verbs Shoot, Hack, Plasmid, and Loot drive a Core_Loop of scavenging ruined halls, mixing weaponry with plasmid powers, and unearthing audio diaries. With Moderate Difficulty, a Medium Length_Category, and Medium Player_Agency, the game projects a Dark Emotional_Tone enhanced by a Licensed + Orchestral Audio_Approach. The celebrated Innovation_Highlight‚Äîa plot twist inseparably tied to player agency‚Äîworks in concert with Immersion_Drivers based on rich World-detail and ubiquitous Audio-logs, earning BioShock its place in the elite 90+ MetaScore_Band.

Alright, let‚Äôs stroll into 2008.

Braid (Release_Year 2008, Developer Number None) is best thought of as a Puzzle Primary_Genre dressed up in 2D Platformer and Time-Manipulation Subgenre_Tags. You view it from a 2D Side Perspective, wandering a Surreal Setting rendered in a hand-painted Art_Style. Although its Narrative_Structure is largely Environmental, the action is driven by Core_Gameplay_Verbs‚ÄîJump, Rewind, and Carry‚Äîwithin a Core_Loop that asks you to bend time in clever ways to reach puzzle exits and collect jigsaw pieces. Difficulty lands in the Challenging zone, the adventure sits in the Short Length_Category, and because there‚Äôs only one main solution path, Player_Agency is Low. The Emotional_Tone is gently Melancholic, backed by a Licensed classical Audio_Approach. Its standout Innovation_Highlight is the way that constant, freely available time-rewind turns mistakes into learnable moments, while Immersion_Drivers hinge on pure Mechanics and lingering Ambiguity. Critics agreed, placing it squarely in the 90+ MetaScore_Band.

Grand Theft Auto IV (Release_Year 2008, Developer Rockstar North) takes an Action-Adventure Primary_Genre foundation and layers on Open-World, Crime, and Driving Subgenre_Tags. Everything unfolds from a 3rd-Person Perspective inside a Modern Setting that shoots for gritty realism, complemented by a realistically detailed Art_Style. The game‚Äôs Narrative_Structure is Branching: your choices as Niko Bellic steer which contacts you trust and which endings you see. Core_Gameplay_Verbs‚ÄîDrive, Shoot, Explore, Phone‚Äîfeed a Core_Loop of accepting missions, earning cash, and gradually unlocking the boroughs of Liberty City. Difficulty is set to a steady Moderate, and thanks to multiple mission paths and free-roam chaos, Player_Agency clocks in at Medium; expect a Long Length_Category if you approach every side activity. The Emotional_Tone is decidedly Dark, underscored by a Licensed radio-station Audio_Approach that makes car rides feel alive. Euphoria rag-doll physics married to cinematic cut-scenes form the game‚Äôs headline Innovation_Highlight, while World-detail and sharply written Dialogue act as the chief Immersion_Drivers. Unsurprisingly, it also secured a 90+ MetaScore_Band rating.

2009

Street Fighter IV

Capcom‚Äôs revival of its legendary series lands in 2009, so the Release Year is 2009 and the Developer is Capcom. The Primary Genre is Fighting, boosted by Subgenre Tags that lean into pure Competitive play. Viewed through a 2.5D Perspective and set against a globe-spanning Modern backdrop, it sports a boldly ink-splashed, Stylised Art Style. The Narrative Structure is Episodic‚Äîevery character‚Äôs arcade ladder offers a quick vignette‚Äîbut story is secondary to the action. Core Gameplay Verbs are punch, kick, hadoken, and block, all funneling into a Core Loop of one-on-one bouts where you master combos, bait reversals, and climb ranked ladders. Difficulty sits firmly in the Challenging band, while Length Category is essentially endless because the arcade loop repeats as long as you‚Äôre improving. Player Agency is high: every frame-perfect cancel choice is yours. The Emotional Tone is mixed‚Äîserious martial-arts posturing tempered by over-the-top win quotes‚Äîand the Audio Approach layers energetic synth hooks over classic stage themes. Its key Innovation Highlight is the Focus Attack Cancel system, which opens deep new combo routes and risk‚Äìreward mind-games. Unsurprisingly, the main Immersion Drivers are the finely tuned Mechanics themselves, and critical consensus parked the title comfortably in the 90 plus MetaScore Band.

Uncharted 2: Among Thieves

Naughty Dog followed up the original Drake adventure with a 2009 sequel, so the Release Year is 2009 and the Developer name is Naughty Dog. This time the Primary Genre is Action-Adventure, seasoned with Subgenre Tags of Cinematic spectacle and Platform Shooter gunfights. Everything unfolds from a 3rd-person Perspective across a globe-trotting, Historical-meets-Modern Setting rendered in a highly detailed, Realistic Art Style. The Narrative Structure remains Linear, letting the studio choreograph every beat. Core Gameplay Verbs are climb, shoot, puzzle, and quip, and the Core Loop has you traverse vertigo-inducing ruins, survive combat arenas, and enjoy story cut-scenes that glue it all together. Difficulty strikes a Moderate balance and the romp fits the Medium Length Category‚Äîlong enough to wow, short enough to replay. Player Agency stays low because pacing is tightly directed, and the Emotional Tone is light-hearted thanks to Drake‚Äôs banter. A sweeping Orchestral Audio Approach underscores every set-piece. The signature Innovation Highlight is the ‚Äútrain level,‚Äù a seamless action sequence that fuses traversal and combat atop a moving convoy. Immersion Drivers are chiefly Cinematics and lifelike Voice Acting, and the critical response again placed the adventure in the coveted 90 plus MetaScore Band.

From a third-person Perspective you dart through a Surreal Setting of miniature planets rendered in a bright, stylised Art Style. Because the Narrative Structure is linear, the designers can focus every beat on pure movement. Your Core Gameplay Verbs are jump, spin, and gravitate, all feeding a Core Loop that sees you hop across micro-worlds, gather Power Stars, and unlock ever-larger galaxies.

Braid opens the calendar on Release Year 2008, a passion project from Developer Number None that frames its Primary Genre as Puzzle while seasoning it with Subgenre Tags of two-dimensional platformer and time-manipulation. From a side-on 2D Perspective you explore a dreamlike, Surreal Setting painted in an almost watercolor Art Style.
