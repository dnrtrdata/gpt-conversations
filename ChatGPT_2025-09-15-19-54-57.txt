I. Standard Four-Seam Fastball Grip
   - Index and middle fingers placed across the seams where they form a horseshoe shape.
   - Fingers are approximately Â½ to 1 inch apart, resting on top of the seams.
   - Thumb positioned underneath the ball, providing support.
   - Ring and pinky fingers rest on the side of the ball for balance.
   - This grip promotes maximum backspin, resulting in a straight and high-velocity pitch.

II. Four-Seam Grip with Horseshoe Inside and Flat Thumb
   - Similar to the standard grip, but with the horseshoe seam facing inward toward the pitcher.
   - Thumb remains flat underneath the ball.
   - This variation can influence the vertical break of the pitch.

III. Four-Seam Grip with Horseshoe Inside and Tucked Thumb
   - Horseshoe seam faces inward.
   - Thumb is tucked under the ball rather than flat.
   - This grip may affect the pitch's spin efficiency and vertical movement.

IV. Four-Seam Grip with Horseshoe Outside and Flat Thumb
   - Horseshoe seam faces outward, away from the pitcher.
   - Thumb remains flat underneath the ball.
   - Adjusting the seam orientation can alter the pitch's movement profile.

V. Four-Seam Grip with Horseshoe Outside and Tucked Thumb
   - Horseshoe seam faces outward.
   - Thumb is tucked under the ball.
   - This variation can impact the pitch's spin axis and movement.

VI. Four-Seam Grip with Narrow Finger Placement
   - Index and middle fingers are placed closer together across the seams.
   - This grip can increase spin rate and control, potentially enhancing the pitch's effectiveness.

VII. Four-Seam Grip with Wide Finger Placement
   - Index and middle fingers are spread wider apart across the seams.
   - A wider grip may offer additional stability but could reduce spin efficiency.

VIII. Four-Seam Grip with Emphasis on Finger Pressure
   - Focus on applying more pressure with the index finger during release.
   - Adjusting finger pressure can influence the ball's spin and movement.

IX. Four-Seam Grip with Emphasis on Middle Finger Pressure
   - Greater pressure applied with the middle finger during release.
   - This adjustment can affect the pitch's trajectory and movement.

X. Four-Seam Grip with Pronated Wrist Position
   - Slight pronation of the wrist at release.
   - This technique can modify the spin axis, potentially adding movement to the pitch.

XI. Four-Seam Grip with Supinated Wrist Position
   - Slight supination of the wrist at release.
   - Altering wrist position can influence the pitch's movement and deception.

XII. Four-Seam Grip with Elevated Thumb Placement
   - Thumb positioned slightly higher on the ball's surface.
   - Changing thumb placement can affect grip comfort and pitch control.

XIII. Four-Seam Grip with Lowered Thumb Placement
   - Thumb placed lower on the ball, closer to the bottom seam.
   - This variation may impact the pitch's release point and movement.

XIV. Four-Seam Grip with Deep Finger Placement
   - Fingers rest deeper on the ball, closer to the palm.
   - A deeper grip can provide more control but may reduce pitch velocity.

XV. Four-Seam Grip with Fingertip Placement
   - Fingers rest on the tips, away from the palm.
   - This grip can increase velocity but may sacrifice some control.

XVI. Four-Seam Grip with Emphasis on Backspin
   - Focus on generating maximum backspin during release.
   - Enhanced backspin can create a "rising" effect, making the pitch harder to hit.

XVII. Four-Seam Grip with Emphasis on Seam Orientation
   - Adjusting the ball so that the seams are aligned to influence movement.
   - Seam orientation can affect the Magnus effect and pitch trajectory.

XVIII. Four-Seam Grip with Split-Finger Variation
   - Index and middle fingers are spread wider apart, resembling a splitter grip.
   - This variation can reduce velocity but increase downward movement.

XIX. Four-Seam Grip with Cutter Influence
   - Slight adjustment of finger placement to the side of the ball.
   - This grip can add lateral movement, creating a cutter-like effect.

XX. Four-Seam Grip with Emphasis on Arm Slot
   - Adjusting the arm angle during delivery.
   - Different arm slots can change the pitch's movement and deception.
