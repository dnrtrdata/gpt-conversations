Give me an exhaustive list of items in which I can use you to create a narrative, 1-4 player "island" in UEFN that adjusts to the amount of players for each play through (with both difficulty -- less players, more manageable combat encounters -- and map-asset-density -- the more players, the less dense the amount of map assets load to allow more movement without players running into/through them so better mobility for multiplayer squads). Also, I want you to account for the all available options for players to customize the experience that UEFN allows.

Here’s a structured, exhaustive list of what you can use me for when creating a dynamic 1–4 player UEFN island with both narrative and scalable design elements:

1️⃣ Core Narrative and Story Features in UEFN

Branching Dialogue Systems: Supported via Verse scripting and Widget Blueprints.

Emergent Narrative Tools: Building systemic interactions through triggers and quests without fixed storylines.

Event Triggers: NPC or player-driven events using UEFN’s device system and Verse.

Player-Driven Story Progression: Memory and variable tracking for player choices.

Quest and Objective Systems: Configurable for solo, duo, trio, squad contexts.

2️⃣ Dynamic Difficulty & Map Density Features

Dynamic Enemy Spawning: Using UEFN’s AI Spawner device and Verse logic to scale enemy count, health, and abilities according to active player count.

Adjustable Combat Intensity: Balancing player experience with adjustable spawn rates and encounter frequency.

Scalable Map Asset Loading: Conditional asset spawning or disabling using Verse conditionals (e.g., denser forest foliage for single players, open spaces for squads).

Adaptive Loot Systems: Varying item availability and rarity to maintain balance across player counts.

3️⃣ Player Experience Customization Options in UEFN

Gameplay Settings:

Health, shields, resource gathering rates.

Movement speed, gravity, jump height.

Starting inventory loadouts.

Visual & Aesthetic Options:

Day/night cycle control.

Weather and environmental FX toggles.

Difficulty Modifiers:

Enemy toughness.

Puzzle complexity and resource scarcity.

Game Mode Selection:

Solo, duo, trio, squad.

PvE, PvP toggle.

Player UI Customization:

HUD visibility.

Quest tracking visibility.

4️⃣ Technical Controls and Logic Structuring

Memory System: To store player stats, mission progress, choice consequences.

Verse Scripting: Core system for custom rules and adaptive systems (AI, map density toggles, spawn limits).

Conditional Logic: Player-count detection using in-game devices (e.g., counting active players on island load).

Spawn Point Management: Adjusting spawn locations and options based on player count using multiple spawn pads and triggers.

5️⃣ UX and UI Customization In-UEFN

Custom HUDs: Created through Widget Blueprints.

In-Game Menus: Settings menus accessible through interaction devices or NPCs.

Dynamic Announcements: Using UEFN’s Text devices and Verse triggers.

6️⃣ Map Layout and Island Setup Considerations

Zone Design: Segmenting the map into scalable sections:

Example: Single-player hidden paths that close for squads.

Collision Management: Enabling or disabling props/structures based on player count.

Resource Nodes: Scalable density based on the number of players.

If you'd like, I can help draft:

A design document or flow chart outlining all these systems specifically.

Mood boards, iconography, and island art styles using DALLE.

Concept art for scalable environments, customizable UI layouts, or player rewards.

Would you like to proceed with one of those next steps, or convert this into a detailed Game Design Document (GDD) format?
