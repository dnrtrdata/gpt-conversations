I want you to generate as many tags as possible for the following content, and sort them by most-to-least important to writing a screenplay based on the author’s inferred intention:

STRUCTURE  
- Structure is a symptom: It naturally emerges from character and conflict, not templates.  
- Analysis vs. creation: Templates analyze films but don’t help create them.  
- Structure isn’t a tool: Following strict structure results in lifeless scripts.  

CHARACTER  
- Follow characters: Great stories follow characters, not formulas.  
- Story is change: Every story tracks internal (mind), interpersonal (relationships), and external (plot) change.  
- Natural storytelling: People instinctively create stories without charts.  

STORY STRUCTURE  
- Three types of change:  
  - Internal: Thoughts & emotions shift.  
  - Interpersonal: Relationships evolve.  
  - External: Plot moves forward.  
- Scenes create change: Each scene challenges a belief, forcing growth.  
- Hegelian dialectic: Stories progress through conflict and resolution.  

THEME  
- Theme = Argument: A story must argue a point, not just explore a topic.  
- Clear argument: “Brotherhood” is vague, but “Brothers always betray each other” is a theme.  
- Irony works best: A strong theme contrasts with the story’s concept (e.g., Finding Nemo argues love means letting go).  

CHARACTER JOURNEY  
- Start: Protagonist believes the opposite of the theme and lives in stable imperfection.  
- Inciting incident: An ironic disruption forces change.  
- Fear & resistance: The hero clings to old beliefs, avoiding what they fear most.  
- Transformation (Act 2):  
  - Reinforce anti-theme: Early events confirm the hero’s false belief.  
  - Oppose character’s desires: The world challenges their attempts to stay the same.  
  - Introduce doubt: Small moments make them question their beliefs.

CATEGORIES & TERMS

CHARACTER JOURNEY  
- Doubt example: A character/event embodying the theme challenges the hero’s anti-theme belief.  
- Midpoint change: Hero briefly acts in line with the theme, creating internal conflict.  
- Low point: Hero loses old beliefs but can’t embrace new ones, feeling trapped.  
- Relapse: Temptation to revert to anti-theme before the final choice.  
- Rejection: Hero refuses the old way, proving theme through decisive action.  
- Let them go: Hero accepts theme by releasing control, facing potential loss.  

THEME  
- Reversed theme: Story punishes the hero’s shift toward theme, reinforcing old fears.  
- Irony: Contradictory events deepen emotional impact (e.g., water-related death for a water savior).  

STORY STRUCTURE  
- Dramatic reversal: Unexpected twist forcing the hero back toward anti-theme.  
- Synthesis: Final story resolution merging thesis (old) and antithesis (new) into balance.  
- Denouement: Post-climax scene showing the hero’s new life aligned with theme.  

CHARACTER  
- Creating your character: Design protagonists who start with anti-theme beliefs and evolve.  

STRUCTURE  
- One act story: Narrative is a continuous journey, not divided into rigid acts.  

NARRATIVE TOOLS  
- Punish the hero: Use cruel, ironic setbacks to test theme commitment.  
- Catharsis through suffering: Hero’s pain creates emotional payoff for the audience.  
- Final test: Hero must *act* on the theme, not just understand it.

Okay I need you to make the tags more concise because it needs to be easily identifiable and comprehensible at-a-glance, and at roughly an 8th grade reading level. Each tag needs to be one-to-three words long (and have nothing in the parentheses because that space is reserved for tracking the number of times that aspect of the screenplay is included and maybe a few words on that respective inclusion’s more-granular aspects to make informed style and nuance choices).

Changes & Reasoning:

World-building & mise-en-scène were placed in High Priority as they significantly affect how a story is experienced, even if they aren't strictly plot mechanics.

Ambience, background, VFX, and wardrobe were placed in Medium Priority as they support narrative execution and audience immersion.

Verisimilitude & atmosphere were placed in Lower Priority as they function as underlying storytelling enhancements rather than core tools.

This preserves the screenplay-focused structure while making room for execution-oriented filmmaking elements where they best serve storytelling!

please boil down the following article describing the "monster in the house" story-type focusing on the same aspects: intention/purpose (with careful consideration of where elements fit within the overall chronological order of the story and plot-structure), and how the screenwriter could use the story-framework's areas where flexibility could be exercised. don't lose any of those three core aspects of the document's interpretation, but this time also focus on aspects specific to genre as well:

Is Horror Always 'Monster in the House'?
the 5 leading actors in Jordan Peele's Nope
It’s almost Halloween. Let’s talk monsters!!! Or more specifically… the Monster in the House genre.
I practically live in this genre. I’ve worked on a dozen produced horror movies at this point. I’ve probably written another 20 scripts. ALL OF THEM are Monster in the House stories.

Halloween, Friday the 13th, Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Child’s Play, Alien, Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, IT, Scream, The Thing, A Quiet Place, Candyman, Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, etc, etc.—all of the horror movies I’ve taken the time to analyze or have seen broken down into beat sheets fall into the MITH box with its 3 elements: Monster, Sin, and House.

This week alone, I watched My Best Friend’s Exorcism, Hellraiser (2022), The Watcher, X, and Scream (2022)… all Monster in the House!

(And yes, I watch a ton of horror.)

So every horror movie is a Monster in the House… right?

That’s what I used to think.

Until, one dark and stormy night…

I do a regular podcast where we break down movies to find screenwriting lessons. It’s on the Thunder Grunt Network and it’s called “Writers/Blockbusters”—you should check it out, it’s a Save the Cat! lovefest over there.

Recently, we broke down Jordan Peele’s Nope.

Nope is a horror movie. It’s scary. It’s got a monster. There’s a battle for survival and lots of terrifying set pieces and creepy weirdness.

Monster in the House, right?

Well…

Whenever I analyze movies, the first question I ask is “What’s the pitch?” Who is the hero? What’s their goal? What’s the big obstacle in their way? What are the stakes (if they fail, what happens)?

In Nope, it’s as follows:
Hero: A down-on-his-luck horse trainer
Goal: To get photographic evidence — “The Oprah Shot” — of a UFO that’s menacing his ranch
Obstacle: The UFO and the difficulty of capturing a UFO on film
Stakes: Financial mostly. He’s in danger of losing the ranch that’s been the pride of the family for years.

Is this a Monster in the House?

It has a monster, for sure.

It has a house: the UFO seems confined to an area around the ranch.

It even has a sin: exploiting creatures and even terrible events for spectacle is a theme that runs throughout the movie.

But here’s the addendum I think Monster in the House needs… the people should be trapped in the house. It’s this absence of being able to walk away which really is the hallmark of Horror and is key to Monster in the House. If you can “just walk away,” it’s no longer a story about survival. If the hero chooses to run toward the monster or if the monster is actually “the goal”—is the story a Monster in the House?

I think Nope leans toward the Golden Fleece genre with its 3 elements of road, team, and prize. The characters are chasing a prize: the picture. There’s a team. The journey is the process to get it, the quest. The plot is closer to a heist movie.

the original Hellraiser film poster
Another movie I recently watched was the original Hellraiser. The pitch for that movie could be summarized with the following Story DNA:

Hero: An unfaithful wife.
Goal: To return her lover to flesh and blood by offering sacrifices
Obstacle: She’s not a killer by nature but needs to lure the sacrifices in without her husband or daughter-in-law knowing what she’s doing
Stakes: Being without her lover

The movie does some weird twists switching protagonists in the middle and becoming a more conventional MITH movie in the movie’s second half. But the story’s premise is really about this woman trying to resurrect her lover.

Again, this heroine isn’t trapped. She could move or let her lover stay dead. The house is in no way a prison and this is not a story about survival. If anything, she’s teaming up with the monster, becoming the monster herself. She’s the one that “brings the horror.” The story is probably more of a Golden Fleece or Dude With a Problem genre.

Werewolf By Night poster
Marvel’s recent Werewolf By Night special is the same. A group of monster hunters is invited to hunt a creature in a winner-takes-all competition for a precious prize. Competitions to win trophies are the stuff of Golden Fleece stories. But again, the story has a monster (a couple in this case), a sin, and a house.

While these discussions are fun, I think there’s a big lesson here for writers. STC! Genres help us figure out the story we’re telling and hint at important traits of plot and character, and even though I think the plots of these movies fall into Golden Fleece or Dude With a Problem genres, I still think if you’re writing a horror movie, it should have all the elements of a Monster in the House.

While you can have a Monster in the House that’s not horror (I think of movies like Cable Guy or What About Bob? as extreme examples), horror movies need monsters, the monsters need rules (the house), and the audience must think there’s some culpable reason to possibly kill the heroes (the sin is sort of movie karma).

Nope, Hellraiser, and Werewolf by Night check all these boxes. They also have that other commonly seen trait of MITH stories: the half-man. In Nope, it’s the documentary cameraman they enlist to shoot the UFO on a big old Imax camera. In Hellraiser, it’s the lover locked up in the closet who’s faced the ultimate limits of pleasure and pain and been ripped apart by Pinhead and the creepy gang of Cenobites. In Werewolf by Night, practically all the characters serve as half-men.

And there’s something else to consider: all horror movies ultimately devolve into battles of survival. So even though these three start out as contests or quests or missions and they still have some freedom of choice in the matter… by the Finale, the heroes of these stories are indeed trapped with a monster and must 100% focus on staying alive.

If you’re writing a Horror story, it’s most likely a pure Monster in the House. But even if it isn’t—even if your horror film seems like one of these other genres—if it’s a horror movie, give it a monster, a house, and a sin. And make sure by the end, your heroes are fighting for their very lives.

Boiled-Down Interpretation of "Monster in the House" (MITH) and Its Genre-Specific Applications

This breakdown preserves intention/purpose, chronological plot-structure relevance, and areas for flexibility, while also focusing on genre-specific aspects for screenwriters.

📌 Core Purpose of Monster in the House (MITH)

MITH is a horror-driven survival story that hinges on three essential elements:

Monster – A lethal, supernatural, or larger-than-life force.

House – A confined space or inescapable setting.

Sin – A transgression that justifies why the characters deserve their predicament.

The defining feature of MITH is inescapability—the protagonist(s) must be trapped with the monster, making survival the story’s primary concern.

📜 Chronological Order & Structural Considerations
🔹 Act 1: Establishing the House & Sin

The House: Introduce the setting as an inescapable space.

The Sin: Reveal (or foreshadow) the moral transgression that “summons” the monster.

The Monster: Establish the threat, often through an early kill or unsettling event.

The Half-Man: A character who has survived or encountered the monster before, providing key exposition.

✅ Genre Flexibility: The "house" doesn’t have to be a literal house—it can be a spaceship (Alien), a town (IT), or even a psychological prison (The Babadook).

🔹 Act 2: The Horror Tightens Its Grip

Survival Becomes the Goal: The characters realize they can’t just leave.

Escalating Deaths: The monster picks off victims one by one.

Rules of the Monster: The story establishes the monster’s strengths, weaknesses, and patterns.

Moral Reckoning: The sin starts to feel like a death sentence.

Plan to Survive: The protagonist (and survivors) attempt to outsmart or escape the monster.

✅ Genre Flexibility: Some horror films (e.g., Nope) introduce quest or heist-like structures before survival takes over. This allows hybrid storytelling within horror.

🔹 Act 3: No More Running, Only Survival

Final Confrontation: The protagonist faces the monster in a last stand.

Sin Comes Full Circle: The monster exploits the character’s original sin or forces them to atone.

Escape (or Doom): The protagonist either destroys the monster, barely escapes, or is consumed by the horror.

Denouement: The final scene suggests lingering horror or consequences.

✅ Genre Flexibility: Even if a horror film starts as a quest (Nope), a competition (Werewolf by Night), or a Faustian bargain (Hellraiser), by the finale, survival is the only priority.

🎭 Genre-Specific Considerations & Flexibility
Genre Variation	How It Affects MITH
Slasher Horror (Halloween, Scream)	Emphasizes a human killer as the monster. The house is often an isolated town or home. Sin is past mistakes or ignorance.
Supernatural Horror (The Conjuring, The Ring)	The monster follows paranormal rules. The house is often a cursed place or object. Sin is provoking the unknown.
Psychological Horror (The Babadook, Hereditary)	The monster is metaphorical (grief, trauma). The house is the mind or a family home. Sin is emotional repression or guilt.
Creature Feature (Jaws, A Quiet Place)	The monster is a force of nature. The house is the wilderness, ocean, or an isolated town. Sin is hubris or disturbing the natural order.
Sci-Fi Horror (Alien, The Thing)	The monster is alien or scientifically enhanced. The house is a spaceship, lab, or remote base. Sin is corporate greed or human curiosity.

✅ Genre Flexibility: Even if a horror story leans toward a quest (Golden Fleece), a thriller (Dude With a Problem), or a mystery, it should still include Monster, House, and Sin for effective horror execution.

🔑 Key Takeaways for Screenwriters

MITH stories demand confinement: If the protagonist can “just walk away,” it’s not horror.

Sin gives the horror weight: If the heroes are blameless, the story lacks dramatic irony.

Survival must become the only goal: Even in films that start with quests, heists, or competitions, Act 3 must force survival over everything else.

Genres blend, but horror needs its rules: Even when borrowing elements from heist films (Nope), battle royales (Werewolf by Night), or Faustian bargains (Hellraiser), the horror should retain MITH’s inescapability and consequences.

Final Thought:

If you’re writing horror, even if it doesn’t start as a Monster in the House, it should end like one.

MONSTER IN THE HOUSE (MITH) — BOILED-DOWN SCREENWRITING FRAMEWORK  
===============================================================

Core Purpose
------------
Monster in the House (MITH) is a horror-based survival framework defined by:
1. MONSTER — A deadly force, creature, or being.
2. HOUSE — A confined or inescapable setting.
3. SIN — A moral transgression that justifies the horror.

True MITH horror stories force characters into survival mode — they must be *trapped* with the monster. The key isn’t just fear, it’s inescapability.

Chronological Story Structure
-----------------------------

ACT 1: Setup
------------
- HOUSE: Establish the confined or cursed setting.
- SIN: Introduce the transgression (moral failing, temptation, hubris).
- MONSTER: Reveal or foreshadow the threat.
- HALF-MAN: Include a survivor or expositional character who understands the monster.
- FALSE ESCAPE: Suggest that there may be a way out (but this will collapse later).

ACT 2: Escalation
-----------------
- ESCALATING THREAT: The monster attacks more overtly.
- ESTABLISH RULES: Monster’s behaviors, limitations, weaknesses made clearer.
- SIN CONSEQUENCES: Characters begin to understand their culpability.
- SURVIVAL TACTICS: Group devises a plan to escape or destroy the monster.
- NO ESCAPE: The idea of escape is stripped away — survival becomes the ONLY goal.

ACT 3: Confrontation
--------------------
- FINAL SHOWDOWN: The protagonist confronts the monster directly.
- SIN RECKONING: The sin is either atoned for or damns the character.
- RESOLUTION: Either the monster is defeated (with loss) or victory is ambiguous.
- DENOUEMENT: A coda reinforces the consequences or surviving trauma.

Genre-Specific Applications
---------------------------
| Genre                 | Monster           | House            | Sin                         |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Slasher Horror       | Human killer      | Home/town        | Ignoring danger, past sin   |
| Supernatural Horror  | Ghost/demon       | Cursed location  | Disturbing the dead/unknown |
| Psychological Horror | Internal trauma   | The mind/family  | Repression, denial          |
| Creature Feature     | Natural beast     | Nature/town      | Hubris, greed               |
| Sci-Fi Horror        | Alien/science     | Ship/lab/base    | Playing God, curiosity      |

Genre Flexibility & Hybrid Models
---------------------------------
- Some horror stories start in other Save the Cat! genres:
  *Golden Fleece (quests)*: e.g. *Nope*
  *Dude With a Problem (unwilling hero in crisis)*: e.g. *Hellraiser*
  *Whydunit (mystery-based horror)*: e.g. *The Ring*
- These genres often pivot into MITH in Act 2 or 3.
  Survival becomes the *only* objective.

Essential Lessons for Screenwriters
-----------------------------------
- MITH horror must evolve into a survival story.
- Heroes can have agency early on — but by Act 3, they must be TRAPPED.
- "Sin" isn’t optional — it creates poetic justice and moral stakes.
- Even if the story feels like a quest, competition, or mission — make the ending survival-based.

Final Thought
-------------
Even if your horror story starts as something else (heist, chase, romance, etc.)...
...it should *end* like a Monster in the House.

Always include:
- A Monster
- A House (inescapability)
- A Sin

--------------------------------------
