*INTRO MUSIC*
Poor old Jacob Lee can't catch a break.
First he has to deal with people always asking
him if he's still making movies with Kevin Smith,
then his space truck explodes over an evil space
prison and he gets thrown into the space prison
for some unclear crime, possibly littering.
Then all the prisoners get infected with zombie
virus and become more interested in twatting
Jacob Lee to death than in trading cigarettes for
handjobs, and if all that weren't enough to put
the bow on Jacob Lee's shitty day, he then has to
spend the next ten hours being the protagonist of
a fucking awful video game.
But be realistic, Jacob Lee, you're hardly Silent
Hill material, you'd need to learn more than two
facial expressions besides Stupid Confused and
Stupid Neutral.
The Callisto Protocol, then, unashamed Dead Space
clone by what has retroactively been revealed to
be the less competent of the two creators of Dead
Space.
So you should know what to expect of the basic
gameplay - third person creeping through dark
metal corridors, frequent ambushes by screaming
ambulatory piles of expired deli meat, and
several NPC support characters whose plans always
seem to boil down to Jacob having to make his way
through nine levels of murder basement while they
stay in an air conditioned computer room making
sure the screen saver doesn't come on.
Still the core combat has more of a melee focus
than Dead Space.
I know, because I walked out of my cell at the
start of the game and got immediately twatted to
death by the first enemy.
The game was trying to teach me how to dodge, you
see.
Hold in a direction and Jacob will automatically
dodge, it said.
Oh, well that's kind of an original dodge
mechanic.
Is this direction OK?
"NO.
Now watch a five minute death animation as the
enemy shoves its fist down Jacob's throat and
uses him as a washing up glove."
This happened twice in a row.
I think you're supposed to push in the direction
away from where the attack's coming from.
Or towards it.
Or corresponding to which limb the enemy's
attacking with.
Or their Zodiac sign.
Honestly it always felt random whether I'd picked
the right direction to dodge in, but then I have
trouble making rational decisions when a dude
with a face like a Rice Krispie treat is
sprinting towards me with one hand raised and a
pile of dirty dishes in the other.
So straight off I was getting Outlast 2
flashbacks.
Make one tiny error right at the start thanks to
poorly explained mechanics and get to watch our
protagonist gasping at the sliced meatball
sandwich that used to be their cock and balls for
thirty seconds.
Horrifying, yes, but then you reload, pop back to
life, and all tension is deflated.
It sets the game off on the wrong foot and
instantly turns horror into frustration, although
Callisto Protocol seems to be generally bad at
telling the difference.
It just loves stealing health.
Semi-regularly you walk into a room or open a
cupboard and the game goes "THINK FAST" and a
little face hugger will rocket towards you like
the fucking killer rabbit from Monty Python and
go "Hee hee hee!
Free damage for me!
Nom nom nom nom nom!"
And you have to mash a button to rip it off.
There is never a fucking way to see it coming.
So what am I supposed to do, here, game?
Not go into rooms?
Not search every single cupboard?
Have you played survival horror before?
I have to go through every cabinet looking for
ammo and health like an extremely stoned medical
student in a communal kitchen at two in the
morning.
That's how the survival part works.
Just to skip to the end for a moment, Callisto
Protocol is, spoiler warning, a load of old shite
and bumbags, and the funny thing is that all its
major issues stem from a single point, and that's
the animations.
The very least of it are the unskippable,
prolonged and gratuitously cruel death scenes
that are our punishment for not intuiting we were
supposed to dodge left if our enemy was born in
the Chinese year of the pig, and before long the
moment I saw them start I'd just quit to main
menu and reload my save, which was usually faster.
Also, if you run out of ammo during a fight then
you're fucked, because the painfully slow reload
and switch weapon animations don't count if
they're interrupted, and they will be, because
these furious reject seasonal McDonalds burgers
on legs are very aggressive and very keen to get
their washing up done.
If you need to heal up in combat then you're
double fucked, because Jacob can't just man up
and jam the glowing green needle in his neck,
he's got to slowly crouch and carefully lay down
a little picnic blanket to sit on, first.
Also also we can't swing our melee weapon
straight away if it's currently holstered.
So I'd take it out and try to keep it ready while
creeping through the hallways looking for the
inevitable next ambush and dumbotits here keeps
fucking holstering it again without me asking.
You need both hands to pick your fucking nose, or
something?
Oh, and the animators must've been particularly
proud of the 3D printing sequence at the upgrade
station 'cos we have to sit through the whole
fucking thing every time we buy any upgrade for
our guns, and over and over again if we bought
one right before one of the frustratingly hard
boss fights, 'cos the thought of putting in an
autosave after the upgrade station apparently
slipped everyone's minds while they were
rendering another seven different ways to pull
Jacob Lee's knackers off.
I don't know if the lead animator was mobbed up
and threatening to call Louie Fishlips to come
break kneecaps if any animations got skipped, but
it's as good an explanation as any.
Hang on, I feel like I forgot to mention
something...
oh yeah: there are guns.
There's a pistol, a shotgun, another pistol, and
another shotgun.
Never figured out what the precise differences
were, but at least it meant having twice as many
ammo types to clutter the severely limited
inventory with.
And you can't throw away guns once you've crafted
them, so you'll keep getting ammo for them even
if you want to focus on pistol classic and
caffeine free shotgun.
Callisto Protocol is an almost refreshingly bad
game.
Riddled with misguided and frustrating design
choices rather than the usual generic drivel.
Although it's generic drivel as well, make no
mistake, we're plumbing into new dimensions of
shite-osity.
Feels like Dead Space with all of Dead Space's
interesting edges sanded down.
Unique limb cutting gameplay replaced with
generic twatting about.
Unique monster design replaced with generic
cornflake zombies.
Who were of course created by a generic alien
parasite dredged up from a generic ancient ruin
and then deliberately spread by generically evil
rich people for generic super soldier reasons.
And then after a generic final boss fight against
a generic monster man the plot has the sheer gall
to end on a cliffhanger.
Read the room, Callisto Protocol.
"Bet the last ten hours of punches to the
bollocks have whetted your appetite for an
additional mule kick to the prostate."
The fundamental flaw of Catpiss Pokeyballs is
that its core gameplay demands a speed of thought
and action that the sluggish control and
animations disallow.
As I say, frustration and horror are not the same
thing.
Horror is discovering what your overweight
grandma did to your toilet, frustration is trying
to get an emergency plumber around on
Thanksgiving weekend.

REVIEW: The Callisto Protocol Fails to Launch — A Horror Game Lost in Its Own Animations  
By Polygon Staff

Poor Jacob Lee. First, his space truck explodes. Then, he's thrown into a prison orbiting Jupiter for what might be littering. And just when you think things can’t get worse, he’s trapped in a sci-fi horror title that fundamentally misunderstands what horror even is. *The Callisto Protocol*, the debut release from Striking Distance Studios, tries to be the spiritual successor to *Dead Space*—and lands more like a broken airlock door.

Let’s be clear: this is a clone. From shadowy metal corridors to grotesque bio-abominations sprinting at you with kitchen utensil fury, everything about this game evokes *Dead Space*. Unfortunately, what *The Callisto Protocol* fails to replicate is *Dead Space’s* understanding of tension, balance, and rhythm. Instead, it offers combat that feels more like a broken quick-time event and horror that too often crosses the line into slapstick frustration.

The melee system is the clearest example of this confusion. The game attempts an original dodge mechanic: hold left or right, and Jacob should dodge incoming attacks. Should. The reality is more complicated—and much more random. Failing to read the enemy’s "Zodiac sign" or "dominant limb" results in death animations so long and lovingly rendered, you’ll start quitting to the main menu just to reload faster.

These sequences, however technically impressive, are emblematic of the game’s deeper problem: an obsession with animation over function. Reloading a weapon mid-fight? You’d better hope you have plot armor because the reload animation is so slow it may as well be turn-based. Healing? Sit down, unroll a metaphorical picnic blanket, and hope the next abomination waits politely. Even crafting upgrades comes with unskippable 3D printing cutscenes—every single time. And no, there’s no auto-save afterward.

The inventory system only compounds the issue. With multiple versions of pistols and shotguns (whose differences are never clearly explained), ammo types quickly choke the limited inventory space. Once a weapon is crafted, it’s yours forever, meaning you’ll still receive ammo for guns you’re no longer using. There’s no way to declutter, only to endure.

The enemies themselves, affectionately described as “ambulatory expired deli meat,” lack the imaginative design that made Necromorphs iconic. These are off-brand, cornflake-coated zombies born of the most generic horror backstory possible: alien parasites, ancient ruins, evil corporations, and a cliffhanger ending shameless enough to demand a sequel after hours of player abuse.

At the center of it all is Jacob Lee—voiced by *Transformers*’ Josh Duhamel—who cycles between two facial expressions: confused and more confused. His lack of charisma might be forgivable in a game that gave the player control and agency. But when you're repeatedly punished for imprecise mechanics, with no recourse but to replay and rewatch, it becomes impossible to invest in the journey.

There are moments where *The Callisto Protocol* teases a better game: the industrial art direction, a few environmental scares, and some crisp sound design show glimmers of potential. But it’s all buried beneath sluggish pacing, punishing design choices, and a fundamental misunderstanding of what players find scary versus what they find enraging.

Instead of invoking the dread of isolation and the thrill of survival, *The Callisto Protocol* becomes a chore. It’s a game where combat demands split-second decisions, but animations move like molasses. A game that punishes curiosity in a genre built on exploration. A game that never realizes horror and frustration are not interchangeable.

*The Callisto Protocol* is what happens when style suffocates substance, when a horror game forgets it’s supposed to be scary—and ends up being tedious instead.

SCORE: 4/10

REVIEW: The Callisto Protocol Deserved Better — A Misunderstood Survival Horror Experiment  
By Polygon Staff

When *The Callisto Protocol* launched, it was practically buried under the weight of its own expectations. Marketed as a spiritual successor to *Dead Space* (by none other than *Dead Space* co-creator Glen Schofield), it felt fated to fail in comparison. But what if that comparison was never fair to begin with? What if this brutally divisive title was never meant to be the next *Dead Space*—and our insistence on treating it as such blinded us to what it *was* trying to be?

That’s the argument this exhaustive retrospective sets out to make, and it’s a compelling one. Drawing deep comparisons not just to *Dead Space*, but to *The Evil Within*, *Resident Evil 4*, and even *Bloodborne* and *Doom Eternal*, this review reframes *The Callisto Protocol* not as a failure of horror design, but as a failed experiment in player communication.

Because at its core, *The Callisto Protocol* tries to be bold. Its brutal melee combat system—frustrating at launch due to broken dodge mechanics and poor optimization—was always intended to be something different. Something brawler-like. Something reactive and aggressive. Not the passive, ammo-conserving dance of traditional survival horror, but a desperate and physical face-off against overwhelming odds. The tragedy is that the game never taught players how to appreciate it. Its greatest sin, this review argues, wasn’t mechanical—it was pedagogical.

Much of the game’s negative reception can be traced to launch issues: inconsistent performance across platforms, especially on PC; sluggish animations tied to essential combat and healing functions; obtuse tutorialization. Yet, according to this analysis, post-launch patches significantly improved those issues, enabling a deeper appreciation for what *The Callisto Protocol* was trying to accomplish. And when played with those expectations recalibrated? It becomes a far more engaging, satisfying, and even innovative experience.

The review also takes aim at the notion that *Callisto* is merely derivative. While surface-level similarities to *Dead Space* exist—over-the-shoulder cameras, sci-fi horror trappings, severable limbs—the actual thematic DNA of the game is closer to *The Evil Within*, both in its ambitions and its mistakes. Like that game, *Callisto* tries to push survival horror into new terrain, but stumbles over uneven pacing, shallow writing, and underdeveloped systems.

Visually, however, the game excels. From PS4 Pro to PS5, the environments are richly detailed and atmospheric. The industrial hell of Black Iron Prison, the frostbitten surface of Callisto, and the slick sci-fi labs all shine with visual confidence. Jacob Lee, brought to life through mo-cap by Josh Duhamel, is one of the most beautifully animated characters in the genre. The death animations—though repetitive and sometimes jarringly disconnected from gameplay—demonstrate a love of craft, even if they undermine tension through overuse.

But the review’s deepest critique isn’t about polish. It’s about horror. For all its gore and brutality, *Callisto* rarely evokes *fear*. The enemy design—grotesque humanoids called biophages—leans heavily on “gross-out” without achieving psychological unease. Unlike the Necromorphs of *Dead Space*, these enemies never truly feel uncanny or unpredictable. Their behavior is simplistic, their threat blunt. The game’s horror lacks negative space; it’s all tension, no release.

Narratively, *Callisto* suffers from cliché: evil corporations, virus outbreaks, lost humanity. But the review finds solace in the cast’s performances—especially Duhamel as Jacob and Zeke Alton as Elias. The relationship between Jacob and Elias is the emotional heart of the story, culminating in a genuinely tragic and well-acted moment that offers more emotional weight than the game’s main plot.

The soundtrack, too, is a curious experiment. Forgoing traditional melodies, it leans heavily on the eerie, improvisational tones of the “Apprehension Engine,” creating a blend of music and ambient noise that blurs the lines between score and soundscape. The result is immersive, if not always memorable.

Ultimately, this review doesn’t argue that *The Callisto Protocol* is secretly a masterpiece. Instead, it positions the game as a rough but ambitious entry in the survival horror genre that dared to ask different questions—and paid the price for not answering them clearly enough. It’s a game that stumbles, but with purpose. And if nothing else, it suggests that Glen Schofield still has bold ideas worth listening to.

COUNTERPOINT: Dead Space Remake — What Callisto Protocol Could’ve Been  
By Polygon Staff

If *The Callisto Protocol* was a bold gamble that didn’t pay off, then the *Dead Space* Remake is a safe bet that did—and serves as a striking counterexample to everything Callisto aspired to be but fell short of. Where *Callisto* tried to redefine survival horror with unrefined mechanics and miscommunicated ambition, *Dead Space Remake* is a masterclass in clarity, polish, and player-focused design.

Much of that comes down to maturity—not just in narrative voice, but in understanding the audience. The *Dead Space Remake* rebuilds its 2008 predecessor with modern sensibilities: smoother pacing, cleaner UI, vastly improved performances, and a story that (while still pulpy) lands with more confidence than its low-budget Sci-Fi Channel origins. The dialogue is no longer barked by voice actors on their way out the door. Isaac Clarke is no longer a silent mule passively obeying orders but a character with agency, voice, and believable age.

By contrast, *The Callisto Protocol* positions itself as equally cinematic but lacks narrative cohesion. While its visuals and mocap are top-tier, its dialogue and pacing swing between overwrought and undercooked. Its attempts at emotional resonance (like Elias's death) hit harder than expected—but feel isolated in a sea of tonal inconsistency. The remake of *Dead Space* offers a steadier tone, taking the source material’s rough brilliance and sanding down its clumsy edges without dulling its identity.

Even mechanically, *Dead Space Remake* demonstrates what refinement looks like. The famous dismemberment-based combat remains intact, bolstered by better aiming fidelity (especially on mouse and keyboard), satisfying weapons, and organic pacing between exploration, combat, and resource management. *Callisto’s* melee-first system, while thematically interesting, lacks this finesse. It demands precision while being sluggish and punitive, made worse at launch by a refusal to explain itself. Where *Dead Space* guides without handholding, *Callisto* often abandons the player in confusion.

The *Dead Space Remake* also excels in subtlety—a trait *Callisto* often trades for bombast. Instead of constantly blaring noise to manufacture fear, *Dead Space* uses negative space and silence. Its scares are built on atmosphere and misdirection, not constant audio assaults or repeated jump scares. As the review bluntly states: "*If all of it is scary, then none of it is scary.*"

There are criticisms, of course. The remake's zero-G changes are a downgrade for some, and the streamlined GUI menus don’t mesh well with mouse input. But these are footnotes in a game that understands the rhythm of horror, the importance of contrast, and the trust it must earn from its player.

In the end, *Dead Space Remake* shows how to honor a legacy while modernizing its mechanics. It doesn’t innovate wildly—but it refines with purpose. *Callisto Protocol* tried to reinvent the genre, and in doing so, lost its grip on what made the genre work. If one is a flawed but heartfelt prototype, the other is a polished blueprint. And in survival horror, clarity of vision often trumps volume of ambition.
