Absolutely. Here’s a thorough, informal, and barely-organized essay-style rewrite of the transcript, pivoting around the present-day peace wall in Belfast. This version attempts to preserve every relevant detail — from the macro history to the micro perspectives — while using the peace wall as the central metaphor and literal structure that bisects identities, actions, memories, and unresolved futures:

There’s a Wall in Belfast That Explains Everything

There’s a wall in Belfast — 25 feet tall, thick, hulking, slicing through ordinary backyards like a post-apocalyptic zoning law. On one side: Catholics. On the other: Protestants. But if you think that’s the whole story — that this is some quaint relic of ancient religious squabbling — you’re already off the mark. It’s not about religion, not really. It’s about who belongs. It’s about who decides. It’s about whose suffering counts.

They call it a peace wall, but it's really more of a scar — one that never healed, never got stitched shut properly. And there are miles of them, still, mostly in Belfast. Twenty miles, to be exact. They run through neighborhoods, through back gardens, through people's histories, fears, and unresolved grief. People say they want them gone — the government even promised they’d be gone by 2023 — but here we are, wall still standing. Because people don’t just tear down trauma. Not when they still live next door to it.

This wall is a physical manifestation of a conflict euphemistically called The Troubles, but more honestly referred to by those involved as the conflict, the war, or the occupation. It lasted from 1968 to 1998 — thirty blood-soaked years, over 3,700 people killed, and around 50,000 injured. But the seeds were planted much earlier.

Let’s rewind.

The Plantation and Partition: When the Wall Was Just a Thought

Northern Ireland’s fracture begins not with the Troubles but with the British colonization of Ireland, starting in the 1100s and intensifying by 1609. That’s when the Crown decided Ulster — the northeastern part of the island — needed to be anglicized. So they confiscated land from native Irish Catholics and handed it over to Protestant settlers from Scotland and Northern England. This wasn’t called theft. It was called the Plantation. It was legal. Sanctioned. Celebrated.

Fast-forward to 1918. Sinn Féin, the nationalist party, sweeps the Irish elections — 91 seats outside Ulster. But Ulster? Protestant unionists win four out of nine counties. That Protestant majority — descendants of those original colonists — made sure Ulster stayed loyal to Britain. Sinn Féin refused to recognize British authority and set up their own government. Cue the birth of the original IRA.

The war for independence followed. Then came the infamous Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. Ireland was split — six counties in the north stayed British; the rest became the Irish Free State. But “Free” was doing a lot of heavy lifting — the new state was still part of the British Empire.

And Northern Ireland? Within two days, it voted itself right back into the UK.

This partition was never just political. It carved the Irish psyche in half. The wall hadn’t been built yet, but you could already see it forming — in who got to vote, who owned land, who policed the streets.

Civil Rights, Internment, and the Tipping Point

By the 1960s, the discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland was flagrant. Protestants got the jobs, ran the courts, doled out the council homes. And local voting rights? Tied to home ownership. No house, no vote. So when Catholic-led civil rights groups started demanding equality — one person, one vote — the establishment flinched.

The British government's response was to arrest without trial. Internment. Thousands were detained in camps — overwhelmingly Catholics, many with no ties to violence. This inflamed the situation. Then came Bloody Sunday — January 30, 1972. British soldiers opened fire on unarmed civil rights protesters in Derry. Thirteen dead. One later died of injuries.

That day became the turning point. Reform was tossed in the bin. Revolution surged.

The IRA, once marginalized, saw its ranks explode.

The Bombs, the Bullets, and the Wall Going Up

What followed was a guerrilla war: ten thousand bombings, nearly 37,000 shootings, and the dead piling up. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the British Army fought the IRA, which by then had become one of the world’s most feared paramilitary forces. In turn, unionist paramilitaries like the UVF and UDA fought back — not just against the IRA, but often against Catholic civilians.

And so the wall was built. One after another. “Peace” walls, they called them. Peace, enforced with steel and concrete.

Michael Colbert was IRA. Billy Hutchinson was UVF. They both went to prison — Michael for 16 years, Billy for murder. They lived on opposite sides of the wall, but the logic was similar: they felt under attack, they joined up, they retaliated. Billy talks about a pub bombing, a baby killed, two pensioners dead — he says the police did nothing. Michael talks about imperialism, the plantation, the big lie of British rule. Neither man regrets their involvement, but both regret the loss of life.

The killing wasn’t always “targeted.” Civilians made up over half the deaths. Sometimes it was retaliation, sometimes it was mistake, sometimes it was just because they lived on the wrong side of the wall. Republican paramilitaries killed 2,057 people. Loyalists killed 1,027. The British Army killed 188. The RUC killed 28.

The Agreement That Didn’t Tear Down the Wall

In 1998, they finally signed the Good Friday Agreement. After two years of negotiation, after three decades of horror, there was peace. Sort of.

The agreement didn’t solve the identity crisis — it just deferred it. Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK until a majority in both north and south voted otherwise. In the meantime, power-sharing, disarmament, referendums. Over 70% of people in Northern Ireland voted for it.

But peace isn’t healing. The walls didn’t come down. Belfast stayed segregated — Falls Road (Catholic) over here, Shankill Road (Protestant) over there. Murals went up. Flags flew. Kids grew up learning to cross streets differently depending on their accents, their sports teams, their last names.

Then Came Brexit: The Border, the Protocol, and the Reopened Wounds

Brexit was like throwing a wrench into the delicate gears of the Good Friday Agreement. The UK had left the EU — but Northern Ireland shared a land border with the Republic of Ireland, still in the EU.

To avoid customs checks along that border (which would resurrect memories of occupation), the Northern Ireland Protocol was created. It moved the border into the Irish Sea — meaning goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland were now subject to EU checks. To Republicans, that looked like a baby step toward unification. To loyalists, it felt like betrayal — a wedge between them and Britain.

Cue rage. Cue protests. Cue graffiti and threats. The peace held, but barely.

The UK government, in political chaos, bounced from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss to Rishi Sunak in under a year. Amidst the instability, the Windsor Framework emerged — a new customs plan with “Green Lanes” for UK-only goods and “Red Lanes” for those entering the EU. Maybe it’ll work. Maybe it won’t.

Meanwhile, the Wall Is Still There

People still live with these walls in their backyards. They still duck questions about identity. Michael talks about wanting a “new Ireland,” not just merging with the corrupt southern state. Billy defends British identity, defends loyalism, warns what would happen if Republicans took over — “it’d be worse than Iran,” he says.

And despite peace, paramilitary remnants linger. Some claim to be activists, some are just gangsters. The power vacuum in working-class areas means these groups still hold sway.

Both Michael and Billy now work toward peace — Michael through an ex-prisoners group, Billy through politics — but even they acknowledge: this isn’t over. Not really.

A Wall That Reminds, Restrains, and Refuses to Be Forgotten

Every time someone walks past the wall, they remember. They remember who died. Who did the killing. Who called it defense. Who called it terror. There are still those who justify, those who regret, those who wish they could forget. But the wall doesn’t let them.

Because this isn’t a war that ended. It’s a war that paused.

And if Brexit or politics or a few more cracks in the fragile peace widen just a little too far — who’s to say it doesn’t start again?

This wall — this so-called peace wall — is the most honest thing in Northern Ireland. It doesn’t pretend anything is resolved.

Absolutely — here’s a more compressed, sectionless, barely-organized version of the rewrite, with all the original transcript's detail merged into dense, informal paragraphs. The peace wall remains the central thread throughout:

There’s a giant wall in Belfast that cuts straight through back gardens and whole lives — 25 feet high, metal and concrete, built not for decoration but separation. On one side live Catholics, mostly Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to be part of a united Ireland. On the other, Protestants, unionists who want to stay in the UK. This isn’t just religion — it’s politics, power, identity, and colonization baked into the streets. And this wall isn’t alone. There are dozens like it, over 20 miles long in total, most in Belfast, separating people still too scared or angry to live side by side, even decades after the bombs stopped falling and the guns stopped firing. It’s called a “peace wall,” but peace here means containment, not healing. Some want them gone — they were supposed to be removed by 2023 — but they're still here because no one actually trusts the other side not to cross that invisible line if the physical one disappears.

To understand how we got here, you have to roll the clock back 800 years to when Britain started colonizing Ireland. Ulster, the northeast region, resisted hardest, so in 1609 the British did what empires do: took land from native Irish Catholics and gave it to Protestant settlers from Scotland and Northern England. This was the Plantation of Ulster, the first draft of the wall. Fast forward to the 20th century and that settler population had become a majority in six counties, while the rest of Ireland pushed for independence. Sinn Féin, the nationalist party, swept the 1918 elections outside of Ulster, but in Ulster, the unionists held strong. Rather than take their seats in British Parliament, Sinn Féin formed a breakaway Irish Republic and backed it with armed resistance — the original IRA was born. A bloody war followed, ending with the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty that split the island in two: an Irish Free State in the south and a UK-aligned Northern Ireland in the north. Within 48 hours of the treaty, Northern Ireland rejoined the UK. And that line became real — not just on maps but in housing, jobs, courts, votes, and neighborhoods.

Even after the treaty, resentment didn’t cool. Catholics in Northern Ireland faced systemic discrimination: Protestant-run companies wouldn’t hire them, Protestant-majority councils allocated housing preferentially to their own, and voting rights were tied to property ownership — if you didn’t own a home, you didn’t get a vote, and guess who didn’t get the homes? Wealthy Protestant landlords could cast multiple votes, while working-class Catholic families often had none. Reformers demanded one person, one vote — a basic civil right — but instead of addressing the inequality, the British government responded with internment: sweeping up suspected IRA sympathizers and throwing them in camps without trial. That didn’t stop the IRA — it gave them oxygen. Even before that, the IRA had never fully disbanded after the civil war, and now, with a civil rights movement under threat and young Catholics seeing no future in peaceful protest, recruitment surged. But the moment everything snapped was January 30, 1972 — Bloody Sunday — when British soldiers opened fire on a protest in Derry, killing 13 unarmed civilians. That day burned through whatever patience was left. Reform died. Revolution surged. People who might have never joined the IRA before joined now, convinced that peaceful resistance only got you shot.

And so began the long war — the Troubles — a three-decade stretch of bombings, assassinations, riots, ambushes, and occupation. Over 3,700 killed, around 50,000 injured. Belfast became a militarized zone. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), an overwhelmingly Protestant police force, teamed up with 21,000 British troops under Operation Banner — the UK’s longest military deployment in history. They weren’t the only ones arming up. Loyalist paramilitary groups like the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) also mobilized, targeting Republican neighborhoods, often murdering civilians. Their logic: terrorize Catholics until the IRA stops. The IRA, meanwhile, didn’t restrict itself to Northern Ireland. They struck in Britain, even once in Australia. The entire map became a battleground. Bombs in pubs, police officers gunned down, retaliation upon retaliation. Ten thousand bombings, 37,000 shootings. Families shattered. Kids grew up crossing the street depending on their religion. Murals went up, flags went up, the walls went up.

Two of the people caught up in this were Michael Colbert, who joined the IRA and served 16 years in prison, and Billy Hutchinson, who joined the UVF and served time for murder. Michael talks about colonialism, land theft, and growing up under systemic oppression. Billy recalls a bomb that killed a baby and pensioners he knew — the IRA had planted it, and in his eyes, someone had to strike back. Neither regrets joining. Both regret the deaths. Both insist they had no other choice. Michael frames it like resisting the Nazis — asks whether we’d condemn the French Resistance. Billy echoes the same point: what else were they supposed to do when the state failed to protect them?

Eventually, the violence burned itself out — or at least reached a point where people were willing to stop shooting if politics could offer something better. That “something” arrived in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. After two years of negotiation, Republicans and Unionists agreed to share power. Paramilitaries began decommissioning weapons. Referendums passed in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. British troops began to withdraw. The peace was imperfect — it still left Northern Ireland in the UK — but it gave everyone just enough hope to keep the guns down. Northern Ireland would stay British until a majority on both sides of the border voted otherwise. In the meantime, people could live as if borders didn’t exist — thanks to the EU. Identity could be fluid. A Catholic could call herself Irish and carry an Irish passport; a Protestant could feel British and fly the Union Jack. It worked. Mostly.

Then came Brexit. When the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, it ripped the rug out from under the peace process. Northern Ireland was suddenly the UK’s only land border with the EU. No one wanted a hard border between north and south — it would revive too many ghosts. So the UK and EU pushed the customs border into the Irish Sea. Technically elegant, politically explosive. Republicans didn’t mind — it pulled Northern Ireland closer to the Republic. But Unionists felt betrayed, severed from Britain. The Northern Ireland Protocol became the new front line — metaphorical, bureaucratic, but just as contentious. The Windsor Framework tried to patch it with Green and Red lanes to ease trade. It hasn’t been fully implemented yet, and no one knows if it will work.

Meanwhile, back on the ground, that original wound — that old wall — is still standing. You can still walk down streets in Belfast and know immediately which side you’re on, based on the flags, the murals, the language on the lampposts. You still see IRA memorials in Catholic areas and tributes to British forces in Protestant ones. The neighborhoods remain segregated. Kids still grow up on one side or the other. And even though the walls were supposed to come down, people aren’t ready. They want peace, sure, but not peace with vulnerability. They don’t trust what’s on the other side of that steel barrier. Some people have lived their entire lives with the wall literally in their back garden. They've planted flowers under it. Built sheds next to it. Raised children in its shadow. Ask them about it and they’ll tell you: yeah, they want peace — but not if it means forgetting.

The trauma’s still raw. 54% of the dead were civilians. Republican paramilitaries killed 2,057, a third of them civilians. Loyalists killed 1,027, and 85% of their victims were civilians. The British Army killed 188 civilians, the RUC 28. We know Billy was convicted for his role in murdering two civilian Catholics, not paramilitary members. We think Michael may have ordered the killing of an RUC photographer in front of his children. Those stories don’t go away. Even now, splinter groups like the Continuity IRA still exist. Some still have weapons. Some call themselves activists, but others are just gangsters, using the old language of resistance to mask drug dealing and violence. Most people on both sides reject them now. But the tension never vanished — it just stopped exploding.

And the wall? The wall is still there. It tells you all you need to know. It never declared victory or defeat. It just stood still, waiting, as if unsure whether to fall or grow taller. Because in Northern Ireland, history isn’t over. It’s just quieter. For now.

Brexit Era – The Irish Sea Border

The Northern Ireland Protocol (post‑2016) feels like a bureaucratic peace wall: a “sea border” dividing unionists from the UK mainland and nationalists from the EU, mirroring interface divisions entrenched by Belfast’s concrete walls.

These locations show how closely the peace wall's presence has followed every major eruption of sectarian violence—from burial plots to city-wide riots, from churches to pubs, prisons to sea borders. The wall stands as both a physical barrier and a historical record: in each neighborhood, event, and milestone, communities have responded by building walls—literal and psychological—to make sense of fear, loss, and the fragile pursuit of peace.

Summary & Wall Context
Each of these figures — whether through violence, politics, or ceasefire — left a lasting imprint on neighborhoods still divided by Belfast’s peace walls. The walls stand not just as community boundaries but as physical archives: they witnessed the actions of paramilitary founders like Spence, street leaders like Paisley, peacemakers like Hume and McGuinness, shadow operatives like Stakeknife, and political negotiators like Trimble. Their presence—literal or metaphorical—has shaped the rhythms and tensions of these divided yet interlinked districts, where every speech, bombing, negotiation, or riot happened along the lines those walls drew.
