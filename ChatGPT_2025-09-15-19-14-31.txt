EXPANDED CHARACTER-DRIVEN STORY BIBLE

——

A PLOT: PATTY HEARST'S TRANSFORMATION

PATRICIA "PATTY" HEARST  
- Age: 19–21  
- Heightened Character Traits: Withdrawn but sharp-witted; internally rebellious; emotionally compartmentalized due to an upbringing in wealth where appearances mattered most.  
- Private Life: Strained engagement to Steven Weed, symbolizing societal expectations vs. personal desires. Frequently reads existential literature; secretly keeps a journal expressing dissatisfaction with privilege.  
- Psychological Beats:  
  - Episode 1–2: Acute trauma response: numbness, paranoia, dependency on captors.  
  - Episode 3: Emergence of autonomy within SLA; begins issuing orders, challenging Cinque. Moments of self-awareness mirror back to audience — is she playing a role or believing it?  
  - Episode 4–6: Gradual fragmentation — moments of doubt while publicly doubling down. Small choices (comforting fellow SLA members, refusing to shoot unnecessarily) show internal conflict.  
  - Series End: Assimilation mask worn convincingly, but subtle gestures (lingering on anti-establishment graffiti, cryptic public comments) hint at unresolved identity fractures.  

——

B PLOT: THE HEARST FAMILY'S PRIVATE STRUGGLE

RANDOLPH A. HEARST  
- Age: 50s–60s  
- Public Persona: Confident, controlled media magnate  
- Private Persona: Emotionally cold, prioritizing image and business. Refuses vulnerability until forced by crisis.  
- Performance Notes: Allow for moments where facade breaks: solitary scenes with family photos, reading Patty’s childhood letters. Tension in boardroom scenes versus private bedroom scenes.  
- Psychological Conflict: Torn between protecting the family legacy and admitting public vulnerability. Uses influence to shape Patty's image; direct phone calls to government contacts and CIA officials.  
- Arc: From omnipotence to helplessness, ending with moral ambiguity about how much he cares about Patty as a daughter vs. symbol.  

CATHERINE HEARST  
- Age: 40s–50s  
- Facade: Gracious, composed socialite  
- Reality: Deeply anxious, veiled addiction to tranquilizers or alcohol (optional subplot)  
- Emotional Beat: Makes tearful TV appearances. Privately exhibits unguarded emotional breakdowns — pacing, self-harm gestures like scratching or biting nails to the quick.  
- Conflict: Torn between fighting for Patty’s innocence and wanting her daughter to be "normal" again. Tension between unconditional maternal love and societal expectations.  

——

C PLOT: THE SLA'S PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMICS

DONALD "CINQUE" DeFREEZE  
- Age: 30s  
- Emotional Profile: Narcissistic leader masquerading as revolutionary altruist. Displays intellectual posturing — quoting Mao or Marx, but secretly insecure about his literacy level.  
- Background Layers: Moments recalling his abusive father, shaping his need for dominance. PTSD elements: waking from nightmares, hyper-vigilance during quiet scenes.  
- Arc: Unraveling authority as Patty rises within the SLA. Final siege as symbolic suicide mission.  

WILLIE WOLF  
- Age: Mid-20s  
- Emotional Nuance: Academic arrogance masking self-loathing. Uses Patty as a canvas for his own unresolved class issues.  
- Performance Texture: Eloquent in SLA manifestos, but awkward or tender in quiet scenes — brushing Patty’s hair, teaching her to clean a gun. Unrequited love angle: conflicted between protecting her and exploiting her.  
- Death Scene (Episode 4): Designed as quiet, almost poetic. Visual of his love token found later by Patty as an emotional callback.  

NANCY LING PERRY  
- Age: 20s  
- Backstory: Middle-class dropout, astrology and drug culture escapee. Carries a Tarot deck; reads for SLA members.  
- Emotional Layer: Sarcastic humor, outward bravado masking vulnerability.  
- Conflicts: Jealous of Patty’s rising influence. Small subplots: microaggressions against Patty, subtle bullying.  
- Arc: Dies during the siege, gun in hand, but final flashback shows her as a kinder figure teaching Patty about urban survival.  

ANGELA ATWOOD  
- Age: Late 20s  
- Role: "Big Sister" energy within the SLA. First to show Patty gentleness.  
- Detail Layer: Former cheerleader backstory influences body language: practiced charisma, posture even under stress.  
- Internal Struggle: Torn between family left behind and SLA loyalty. Letters she never sends hidden in personal effects.  
- Death Scene: Quiet smile as flames consume the hideout, acceptance of fate.  

——

ADDITIONAL CHARACTER LAYERS:

STEVEN WEED  
- Age: 20s  
- Character Complexity: Not just the preppy fiancé — show resentment towards Patty's family wealth, feeling emasculated by his lower social standing.  
- Arc: From protective boyfriend to embittered media figure. Final episode moment: Watching Patty’s trial on TV alone, drinking heavily.  

BILL AND EMILY HARRIS  
- Age: 30s–40s  
- Bill: Macho posturing, but emotionally dependent on Emily.  
- Emily: Strategic thinker, eventual business success foreshadowed in subtle moments (organizing SLA logistics, handling money).  
- Marital Fractures: Arguing over Patty’s place in the group, blame for operational failures. Private tenderness — bandaging each other after fire fights.  

——

THEMATIC NUANCE FOR PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT:

- Duality and Masks: Characters often shift between public roles and private selves. Repeated visual motif: mirrors, masks, reflections.  
- Brainwashing vs. Choice: Encourage actors to explore subtle tics or behaviors that shift depending on whether Patty is performing loyalty or living it.  
- Class Tension: Every dialogue between Patty and an SLA member should subtly evoke class differences. E.g., Patty's accidental formal vocabulary, contrasted with SLA slang.  
- Revolutionary Idealism vs. Criminal Reality: Internal SLA debates show cracks in group cohesion. Staged scenes of manifesto-writing sessions juxtaposed with weapon maintenance.  

——

VISUAL/STRUCTURAL NOTES TO SUPPORT PERFORMANCE:

- Extensive use of long takes in key dialogue scenes to allow actors to inhabit emotional arcs without interruption.  
- Flashback and dream sequences designed to blur the line between memory and present — open space for performers to craft ambiguous motivations.  
- Episode scripts should include optional "character monologues" for internal thought voiceovers, adaptable depending on medium (TV or film).

——

MODULAR PITCH REMINDER:
- This format can contract for a two-hour film focusing mainly on Patty, Randolph, and Cinque or expand into an ensemble-driven series where SLA members receive equal weight.
- Talent-friendly material emphasizing psychological realism over caricatured radicalism or privilege.

If you'd like, I can also build sample dialogue snippets or character-specific backstories for casting packets.
