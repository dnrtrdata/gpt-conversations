Can you infer how this text is likely-intended to be organized and organize it into a clear, but incomplete, treatment for a feature-length screenplay?

Here’s the text:

# TREATMENT

## STEP-1: VOMIT-DRAFT
SEQUENCE 1 (ACT 1) - SETUP:
[protagonist-1(intro)]
01. (oi): MAIA is ocean-savvy and confident in the water [with a high-school girls swim-team], but is conditioned to look-out for lone swimmers in open-water [something her tightly-scheduled lifestyle deems irresponsible] but...02. ...when back on land, Maia is weary keeping an eye out for someone who may be in...i. ...any given homeless-camp on...ii. ...any given beach at...iii. ...any given time, and...iv. ...her logic's unclear, but her look-out-target scares her more than the sea.03. As Maia goes about her life inland -- and we get how important World Whale Day is to Kihei -- we retreat out to open water when...
[set_piece-1(surface splash; whirlpools/short-bursts)][trope-1("touch-down" beat,we HORIZONTALLY-SPLIT into 2 PRECISELY-MIRRORED POVs:top-down/bottom-up)][teaser-1(this is all about separating what WE SEE and what WE DON'T SEE regarding the invading "blender" hive-mind)]
04. ...near SUNSET [m.i.t.h./horror style-choice to obscure audience view] something crashes into the ocean surface -- but we don't know from what direction. A tiny whirlpool appears, then something slithers -- then zips away from us (with a burst-acceleration rivaling a croc).
[b_story-1(comma, "giving us the prerequistes for...")][supporting-1(intro)]
05. (ts): DEREK (Maia's father) is busy, efficient, polite, acts swiftly and confidently in his franchise work, but...
[protagonist-2(Maia's support-system ins't very encouraging, so she has trouble recognizing encouragement)]
06. ...Derek REACTS when Maia needs something from him -- leaving her wanting for encouragement (desperately, it seems) -- so...
[supporting-2(intro)]
07. ...NOAH offers some, but it's not how Maia hoped to get it, so she doesn't even seem to understand that she's being offered encouragement -- that might also be because...08. ...Maia uses routine to mask uncertainty, and Noah is like a fixture of her routine, meaning -- to Maia, at least --  that she likes him that way that she likes a pleasant, well-placed and designed piece of furniture she passes on the way from one responsibility to another. However, in this specific scenario, her attitude is colored by the following moment when she spots...
[supporting-3(intro)][protagonist-3(Maia's inability to deal-with/accept her estranged-mom's behavior is her fatal-flaw)]
09. ...MAUREEN -- looking pretty homeless, and relatively pretty for an unkempt, homeless woman -- and being Maia's irrisponsible estranged-mother doesn't seem to register to Maureen as a reason not to cheerfully chat Maia up about...i. ...how The Maui Whale Festival is the most important to Kihei (collectively mind right now and...ii. ...why-and-how we all should all support it; to Maia, it's also notable that...iii. ...Maureen does this in the manner of a book-club buddy that likes to catch up and gossip from time-to-time, contradicting her actual amount of effort to catch up with Maia and her life which hasn't occured since the prevoius September ON MAUREEN'S BIRTHDAY when...iv. Maureen just wanted to find and spend time with Maia doing things that only one of them liked doing; furthermore Maia is mindful that...v. ...she (Maia) did indeed do all those things with her mother and acted like her daughter only for...vi. ... Maia to receive a "see ya, chica" farewell with a backhanded wave and...vii. ...Maureen has not made an effort to see or speak to her only child again until right-goddam-now when they just happened across each other (about 5 months after "see ya, chica", despite them living on the same island for Maia's entire-goddam-life) and this is too many Maureen things (again, that's SEVEN Maureen things in, like, a little, tiny, intra-minute moment for fuck's sake [Maia's words, not mine]) for Maia to handle here and now so, with eyes clouded in vog-and-anger-induced rager-tears...10. ...Maia keeps moving between -- and constantly bumping into -- the TOURISTS that are already beginning to arrive, and...
[clock-1(intro)]
11. ...they will be out all-day, all-weekend leading up to World Whale Day (in a precious few days -- let's say 2/3 days roughly).12. Maia knows the Humpbacks returning is an important morale-booster -- and economy-booster -- for the island every year which...
[stakes-1(intro)][supporting_character-3(intro)][antagonist-1(intro)]
13. ...KAI reminds her that Maui desperately need these tourist dollars to survive, let alone prosper while having a little-too sticky of fingers, which is an awkward time for Noah to have to bail, but he does so with encouragement for Maia -- which puzzles her when Kai points it out so Maia will stop lecturing her about her "borrowing problem", but NALANI takes Kai off her hands -- which isn't exactly good news (they have fun).
[supporting_character-4(intro)]
14. JAMES is thorough, bossy, and seems to take liberties to give her orders that seem more typical of a parent than...15. ...an uncle (which James is to Maia, as he is Maureen's big brother) who seems to go overboard when imparting the importance of Maia's responsibility to broader aspects of who she is -- things like...i. ...respecting and engaging in the NATIVE COMMUNITY where she came from [avoiding mention of that link being provided by his...a. ...maternally-absent, and...b. ...inarguably-irresponsible little sister] and...ii. ...the ANCESTRAL LAND that supports her, stop and collect himself, then act guilty or regretful, but we don't get an explanation why because he's gotta deal with somekind of...16. ...wildlife issue that's cropped up and is puzzling fisherman and even beach-goers because the regular sea-life and animals that roam the beaches and shallows are either nowhere  to be found or acting crazy.17. (catalyst): Those that make means from the sea [or live/work on/near the beach/water] are nearly attacked or come really close to an unseen underwdater force that picks of a member of the sea-life instead by happenstance [and even the most ocean-savvy are clueless about it -- most-notably Kai and Noah's parents].

SEQUENCE 2 (ACT 1) - DEBATE:
01. Locals are weirded out about the wildlife behavior, but no yet concerned exactly except when...02. ...Maia sees a sentient whirlpool under MURKY, LOW-LIGHT (and any other maybe-reason for an otherwise reasonable middle-to-late-aged local-and/or-native community leader-or-authority to gaslight Maia in a nuanced, dignified manner) circumstances, which she actually approaches and confronts, but is too slow to know what she's looking at...

[antagonist-2(Nalani is politically-minded and her priorities match)]
06.

TREATMENT: "Blubber"
A Feature-Length Horror Screenplay

ACT 1 — SETUP
SEQUENCE 1: Establishing the World & Threat (Opening Image to Catalyst)

Introduction to Maia — A high school swimmer, disciplined and confident in the ocean, but conditioned to watch for lone swimmers, viewing it as reckless. On land, however, she’s preoccupied with looking out for someone in particular—her estranged mother, Maureen.

The First Glimpse of the Threat — During a swim, Maia notices something odd: a whirlpool forming on its own, something slithering, then vanishing in a burst of acceleration. The audience sees it too, but only in fragmented glimpses—what we see vs. what we don’t see becomes a key theme.

Life on Land: Family and Routine — Maia’s father, Derek, is efficient and polite at work but emotionally unavailable to Maia, responding only when she needs something. Noah, a close friend, offers support, but Maia doesn’t recognize it as encouragement, seeing him as part of her routine rather than a meaningful presence.

Maureen’s Return — Maia unexpectedly crosses paths with her mother, Maureen—disheveled, cheerful, and

Some are starting to think that a natural disaster is coming, but those who really know the ocean—like local fishermen—aren't convinced. Something is off in a way they haven't seen before.

Maia tries to brush it off, but the whispers of unease creep into her carefully scheduled world. Ocean-safety drills, warnings from lifeguards, and news reports start stacking up, all circling around something strange in the water.

(debate): Should Maia be worried? Derek dismisses the rumors as fear-mongering. James insists that the ocean is always dangerous if you don’t respect it. Kai and Noah think it’s just another weird ocean thing—the ocean is full of weird things. But Maia? She’s not sure.

That hesitation sticks with her when she gets back in the water. Something about the way the current pulls feels… wrong. It’s almost like the ocean is breathing.

Then—just for a second—she sees it. A shape. A shadow. A blur. But when she looks again… nothing.

Maia shakes it off. Probably just her imagination.

But deep down, she knows—the ocean has changed. Something is in there.

   i. ...how The Maui Whale Festival is the most important to Kihei (collectively mind right now and...  
   ii. ...why-and-how we all should all support it; to Maia, it's also notable that...  
   iii. ...Maureen does this in the manner of a book-club buddy that likes to catch up and gossip from time-to-time, contradicting her actual amount of effort to catch up with Maia and her life which hasn't occured since the prevoius September ON MAUREEN'S BIRTHDAY when...  
   iv. ...Maureen just wanted to find and spend time with Maia doing things that only one of them liked doing; furthermore Maia is mindful that...  
   v. ...she (Maia) did indeed do all those things with her mother and acted like her daughter only for...  
   vi. ...Maia to receive a "see ya, chica" farewell with a backhanded wave and...  
   vii. ...Maureen has not made an effort to see or speak to her only child again until right-goddam-now when they just happened across each other (about 5 months after "see ya, chica", despite them living on the same island for Maia's entire-goddam-life) and this is too many Maureen things (again, that's SEVEN Maureen things in, like, a little, tiny, intra-minute moment for fuck's sake [Maia's words, not mine]) for Maia to handle here and now so, with eyes clouded in vog-and-anger-induced rager-tears...  

10. ...Maia keeps moving between -- and constantly bumping into -- the TOURISTS that are already beginning to arrive, and...  

   [clock-1(intro)]  

11. ...they will be out all-day, all-weekend leading up to World Whale Day (in a precious few days -- let's say 2/3 days roughly).  

12. Maia knows the Humpbacks returning is an important morale-booster -- and economy-booster -- for the island every year which...

   [antagonist-1(intro)]  

13. ...KAI reminds her that Maui desperately need these tourist dollars to survive, let alone prosper while having a little-too sticky of fingers, which is an awkward time for Noah to have to bail, but he does so with encouragement for Maia -- which puzzles her when Kai points it out so Maia will stop lecturing her about her "borrowing problem", but NALANI takes Kai off her hands -- which isn't exactly good news (they have fun).  

   [supporting_character-4(intro)]  

14. JAMES is thorough, bossy, and seems to take liberties to give her orders that seem more typical of a parent than...  

15. ...an uncle (which James is to Maia, as he is Maureen's big brother) who seems to go overboard when imparting the importance of Maia's responsibility to broader aspects of who she is -- things like...  
   i. ...respecting and engaging in the NATIVE COMMUNITY where she came from [avoiding mention of that link being provided by his...  
      a. ...maternally-absent, and...  
      b. ...inarguably-irresponsible little sister] and...  
   ii. ...the ANCESTRAL LAND that supports her, stop and collect himself, then act guilty or regretful, but we don't get an explanation why because he's gotta deal with somekind of...  

16. ...wildlife issue that's cropped up and is puzzling fisherman and even beach-goers because the regular sea-life and animals that roam the beaches and shallows are either nowhere to be found or acting crazy.  

17. (catalyst): Those that make means from the sea [or live/work on/near the beach/water] are nearly attacked or come really close to an unseen underwdater force that picks of a member of the sea-life instead by happenstance [and even the most ocean-savvy are clueless about it -- most-notably Kai and Noah's parents].

18. Some are starting to think that a natural disaster is coming, but those who really know the ocean—like local fishermen—aren't convinced. Something is off in a way they haven't seen before.  

19. Maia tries to brush it off, but the whispers of unease creep into her carefully scheduled world. Ocean-safety drills, warnings from lifeguards, and news reports start stacking up, all circling around something strange in the water.  

20. (debate): Should Maia be worried? Derek dismisses the rumors as fear-mongering. James insists that the ocean is always dangerous if you don’t respect it. Kai and Noah think it’s just another weird ocean thing—the ocean is full of weird things. But Maia? She’s not sure.  

21. That hesitation sticks with her when she gets back in the water. Something about the way the current pulls feels… wrong. It’s almost like the ocean is breathing.  

22. Then—just for a second—she sees it. A shape. A shadow. A blur. But when she looks again… nothing.  

23. Maia shakes it off. Probably just her imagination.  

24. But deep down, she knows—the ocean has changed. Something is in there.
