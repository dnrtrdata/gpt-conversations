You're going to reword the following ideas to apply them to the mediums of film/television:
In this thread, we conducted a comprehensive, data-driven, and rhetorically sharp investigation into the portrayal of female protagonists across modern storytelling mediums—spanning interactive formats like video games, as well as passive forms such as film, television, and literature. Central to our analysis was the concept of *narrative agency*: the extent to which female characters drive their own arcs through meaningful choices, intentions, and consequences, rather than simply being navigated through a plot by the forces around them.

We assembled a detailed catalogue of titles across genres and formats, organizing them based on how they treat female agency. Each entry included both quantitative data (such as sales performance, audience engagement, or critical recognition) and qualitative analysis that interrogated the structure, framing, and thematic implications of the character’s journey. We examined not only what these characters did, but *why* they did it—and whether the story allowed them to act from a place of personal will rather than plot-prescribed trauma.

To deepen the inquiry, we layered in a devil’s advocate perspective that questioned the superficial appearance of strength or depth. This lens interrogated whether supposed “serious” or “complex” portrayals were, in fact, just thinly veiled trauma parades in which women were repeatedly broken for the sake of audience sympathy or narrative heft. It asked hard questions: Does the character make decisions or merely endure them? Is she allowed to pursue her own goals, or is she merely a delivery system for emotional gravity? Does the story respect her autonomy—or exploit her visibility?

From this, five major patterns emerged—each observable in both interactive and passive storytelling formats:

1. **Narrative Trauma ≠ Depth**  
Stories often mistake trauma for character development. Female leads are subjected to elaborate sequences of emotional or physical harm, not as a means of transformation, but as spectacle. When trauma becomes the entire character arc, we’re no longer seeing a human—we’re watching a narrative punching bag dressed up as a protagonist.

2. **Proactive vs. Reactive Characterization**  
Whether it’s a game, film, or novel, a key indicator of agency is whether the character initiates her journey or simply reacts to it. Protagonists like Madeline (*Celeste*), Aloy (*Horizon Zero Dawn*), and Mae (*Night in the Woods*) are defined by internal motives and deliberate choices. Others, like Ellie (*TLOU2*), Amicia (*A Plague Tale*), or Senua (*Hellblade*), are often pushed forward by trauma, vengeance, or obligation—resulting in arcs that feel externally imposed rather than internally chosen.

3. **Audience-Directed Framing**  
Many stories—particularly visual and interactive ones—frame female characters as figures to *protect*, *admire*, or *empathize with*, rather than as full agents within their world. The story becomes more about how the audience or player feels *about* the character than what the character actually *does*. This protective framing disempowers by shifting the axis of control away from the character and toward the viewer or player.

4. **Medium Matters, But Structure Matters More**  
Indie games like *Oxenfree* and *Celeste*, character-driven films, and introspective novels often succeed in portraying real agency not because of their format, but because they prioritize character perspective over plot machinery. Conversely, AAA games, prestige dramas, or big-budget films frequently fall into the trap of confusing grit with depth—mistaking relentless trauma for meaningful development.

5. **Empowerment vs. Performance**  
Characters like Bayonetta, Kassandra (*Assassin’s Creed Odyssey*), or Jesse (*Control*) demonstrate that agency can exist even in highly stylized or exaggerated worlds—*if* the character holds the reins. The problem isn’t sexuality, confidence, or combat skills—it’s when those things are constructed for the viewer’s benefit, not the character’s. Agency isn’t what a character *looks like* doing—it’s what they *intend* when doing it, and what it *costs* them or changes in them when it’s done.

In sum, this exploration taught us that true narrative agency is not defined by whether a protagonist survives, suffers, or triumphs—it’s defined by whether she *chooses*. Across all mediums, the difference between a strong character and a compelling one is not their ability to endure what’s thrown at them, but their ability to shape the path they walk, and own the consequences that follow. Women in stories deserve arcs that aren’t just resilient, but volitional. Not just reactive—but intentional.

Give us women who choose the mountain—not just the ones dragged up it, bleeding, for thematic effect.

In this revised framework, we reoriented our investigation to focus squarely on film and television—mediums where audience perspective is often more tightly controlled and protagonist autonomy is shaped by directorial framing, screenwriting intention, and edit-driven rhythm. We explored how female characters are positioned in these visual narratives, specifically analyzing *narrative agency*: the degree to which a character is the architect of her own arc through discernible choices, intentionality, and causal impact on the plot’s direction, as opposed to being a vessel shuttled through suffering by forces outside her control.

We compiled a cross-section of films and television series—spanning genre, budget, and distribution model—cataloging how each handled female narrative autonomy. Entries were evaluated through both quantitative lenses (box office returns, awards success, viewership metrics) and qualitative frameworks that scrutinized framing, thematic function, and character design. This wasn’t just about what the characters endured or accomplished, but *why* they were there in the first place—and whether the story allowed them agency in determining their trajectory.

A rigorous critical angle was also applied—an interrogative lens that dismantled the illusion of agency when it was merely performance. This line of questioning asked: Is she making choices or absorbing punishment? Does the narrative grant her control over her destiny, or simply burden her with pathos? Is her pain a story pivot, or is it aestheticized trauma—crafted to generate gravitas while concealing hollow characterization? Too often, female characters are framed not as participants in the narrative, but as pressure valves for audience empathy.

Through this analysis, five key trends emerged across film and television:

I. **Trauma ≠ Depth**  
In many dramatic works, female characters are disproportionately subjected to traumatic events that serve no transformative purpose—only to signal “complexity” to the audience. Rather than using trauma to catalyze growth or ethical reckoning, stories frequently flatten it into spectacle. This turns protagonists into symbols of endurance rather than agents of change.

II. **Proactivity Is the Litmus Test**  
Narrative agency is clearest when a protagonist initiates the story’s movement. In character-driven cinema, we see women like Frances in *Frances Ha*, or Nora in *A Doll’s House Part Two*, whose arcs are powered by internal motivations and intentional departures. In contrast, series like *13 Reasons Why* or films like *Promising Young Woman* often disguise reactive pain loops as empowerment—pushing characters through acts of vengeance or disclosure without ever granting them narrative ownership.

III. **The Gaze Displaces the Will**  
In many cinematic or serialized portrayals, the lens prioritizes how the *audience* feels about a female character—admiration, sympathy, protectiveness—over what the character is actively doing. This shift in axis—from subject to object—turns the character into an emotional conduit rather than a dramatic engine. Protective framing, common in both prestige dramas and action thrillers, reinforces a dynamic where female presence is felt primarily through viewer response.

IV. **Budget Doesn’t Dictate Depth—Structure Does**  
Independent films and serialized limited series often allow greater room for narrative autonomy because they structure the plot around character introspection. These stories let women breathe between plot beats—creating space for intention and consequence. Conversely, big-budget dramas and franchises often equate harshness with authenticity, but forget to scaffold a character’s ability to *respond* with agency rather than just *absorb* what’s imposed on her.

V. **Empowerment Is Not the Same as Spectacle**  
Characters like Furiosa (*Mad Max: Fury Road*), Beth (*The Queen’s Gambit*), or Sydney Sweeney’s Cassie (*Euphoria*) show that stylized or overtly aestheticized portrayals can still possess agency—so long as intention, ownership, and consequence are present. The issue isn’t sexuality, suffering, or spectacle. It’s whether those traits are designed to reveal character, or to conceal the lack of it beneath symbolic ornamentation. True agency is embedded in *why* a woman acts, not just *how* she’s shown acting.

Ultimately, this analysis revealed a unifying truth: what defines a compelling female protagonist in film and television is not her capacity to suffer, adapt, or persevere—but her capacity to *choose*. The mark of narrative agency is volition, not endurance. The stories that resonate most deeply are those where women are not simply dragged through plot for dramatic weight, but are allowed to forge, pursue, and revise their own purpose—messily, defiantly, and without apology.

Give us women who climb the mountain because they *chose* the summit—not because it looked cinematic to watch them fall.

This initiative sets out to examine whether the correlations identified in interactive storytelling—particularly regarding female narrative agency—hold true in the mediums of modern film and television. At its core, the mission is to test a hypothesis: that a protagonist’s narrative value is not defined by the gravity of what she endures, but by the clarity and consequence of what she chooses.

We will investigate how female characters are constructed, framed, and positioned within visual narratives, focusing on the concept of *narrative agency*: the ability of a character to influence the direction of the story through intentional decisions, internal motivation, and meaningful consequence. The goal is to determine whether these protagonists are given room to act from volition or merely navigate trauma-laden scripts shaped by external forces.

Our methodology will include a wide-ranging catalogue of contemporary titles, organized by how they handle agency, autonomy, and authorship. Each case will be examined through a blend of performance metrics (such as critical reception and audience engagement) and structural analysis (how character arcs function within the story’s architecture). We will evaluate not just the events that occur to these characters, but whether those events are driven by the character’s own actions—or merely absorbed as part of an imposed emotional gauntlet.

To challenge assumptions, we will apply a devil’s advocate lens that interrogates whether portrayals of strength or complexity are substantive or cosmetic. This perspective will question whether the character drives the story or is driven by it; whether the narrative grants her authorship, or simply visibility; and whether her emotional depth is earned or performed for effect.

This mission is not to indict or celebrate specific works, but to assess whether modern film and television allow female characters to *shape* their arcs—or merely *survive* them. Our objective is to identify patterns that reveal whether cinematic and serialized storytelling fosters genuine character autonomy, or simply reconfigures old tropes beneath a progressive veneer.

The findings will help clarify a central creative question: in today’s visual storytelling landscape, are female protagonists permitted to be authors of their own journey—or are they still being written from the outside in?
