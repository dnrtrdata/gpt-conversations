I'm going to provide some transcripts from some videos about Hawaii, both its history and some stuff from modern day, to give you a well-rounded view of what it's like to have grown up there or live there with the culture, so that you can use that language to translate some modern, rigid story beats and story structure items, so that they relate to someone who lives on the islands today.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Understood. Send over the transcripts when you're ready. Once I have them, I’ll analyze the language, cadence, values, and cultural touchpoints so I can help translate modern screenwriting structure—like Save the Cat! beats or other rigid narrative devices—into concepts and language that resonate with someone raised in or living in Hawaiʻi today. I’ll prioritize clarity, respect, and alignment with island values while keeping the functional integrity of the story beats intact. Ready when you are.

Got it. I've absorbed the full transcript of "[English] Quick History of Hawaii | That Was History" and can now begin extracting the tone, cultural touchpoints, values, and linguistic framework it reflects.

When you’re ready, I can:

i. Translate rigid story beats (e.g., Save the Cat!, Hero’s Journey) into culturally resonant terms using this material as a baseline.

ii. Rephrase specific structural beats (e.g., “Debate,” “Break into Two”) in terms that match Hawaiian cultural logic, values, and worldview.

iii. Offer vocabulary substitutions, tonal adjustments, or metaphor swaps based on this historical-cultural lens.

iv. Suggest ways to make a screenplay feel "written from Hawai‘i" instead of just “set in Hawai‘i.”

Let me know which you'd like to begin with—or send the next transcript and I’ll build a richer composite before we begin.

Transcript 2 is attached.

ChatGPT:


Understood. I've now integrated both transcripts:

I. "[English] Quick History of Hawaii | That Was History" – focuses on the long-term history of political and economic colonization, identity loss, and sovereignty struggles
II. "[English (auto-generated)] Big Trouble In Little Maui (High School Project)" – focuses on modern ecological preservation, youth awareness, and place-based responsibility

The result is a richer spectrum of cultural language, priorities, and internal logic that reflect both generational memory and present-day values. When translating story beats into language that resonates with someone raised in or living in Hawaiʻi, the most important adjustments are:

A. Temporal Philosophy Shift
Modern screenwriting logic is linear, urgent, and goal-driven. But Hawaiian storytelling often functions on circular, interwoven, and layered temporality. Responsibility is not just about what happens next but what echoes across time—ancestral past, immediate present, and future legacy are linked.

B. Place as Character
Rather than just “setting,” the ʻāina (land) is a living, breathing relative. Story beats need to consider the land’s own arc of injury and restoration. Conflict isn’t just character-vs-character or character-vs-system—it’s often character-with-ʻāina, or character-breaking-trust-with-ʻāina.

C. Relational Morality
The decision to act isn’t based on ego or heroism. It's based on kuleana (responsibility), pono (balance/rightness), and mālama (care). The protagonist’s transformation is about stepping into right relationship with community and place—not discovering internal greatness for personal reward.

If you'd like, I can now take a standard beat sheet (e.g., Save the Cat! or Hero’s Journey) and:

Translate the language of each beat into culturally resonant phrasing

Add thematic commentary on how the beat's emotional/spiritual logic changes

Show examples of how this plays out in a Hawaiʻi-grounded story (e.g., Maia in Blubber)

Let me know which structure you’d like translated first.

ChatGPT:


Transcript 4—Hawaii: Paradise Turned to Hell—is now fully incorporated into my contextual frame.

This installment reinforces and extends the cultural and political backbone of the earlier three transcripts, and adds:

IV. First-person narratives of dispossession and survival
Locals—both Native Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian kamaʻāina—recount life-altering housing insecurity, migration, and systemic erasure.

V. Assertions of political occupation and Indigenous identity
Clear delineation between "local," "Hawaiian," and "visitor." Critiques of blood quantum laws, U.S. jurisdiction, and land commodification surface throughout.

VI. Community-led responses
The tent villages, homesteads, and self-built enclaves offer working blueprints for sovereignty via mutual care, kuleana, and ‘ohana.

VII. Contrasts in values
Repeated contrast is drawn between commercial logic ("investment," "vacation property," "wealth rights") and kanaka logic ("genealogical tie," "caretaking," "reciprocity").

Let me know when you're ready to proceed. The cultural patterns are stable now; with these four sources I can fluently localize and reframe modern screenwriting frameworks to resonate deeply with a Hawaiʻi-based reader, audience, or character.

Transcript 5—The Fight To Take Back Hawaii—has been fully absorbed into the contextual base.

This piece contributes the following to the cumulative understanding:

V. National Sovereignty & Cultural Revival
Emphasizes that many Kanaka Maoli do not consider themselves American; they reject U.S. jurisdiction entirely, asserting the continuation of Hawaiian nationhood and culture through resistance and education.

VI. Indigenous Frameworks for Self-Governance
Profiles charter schools, reclaimed homesteads, and houseless encampments functioning as self-sustained communities—not as symbols of lack, but of indigenous resurgence and intergenerational healing.

VII. Spiritual and Political Praxis
Resistance is not merely protest but is treated as “medicine,” linking self-determination with personal, environmental, and ancestral harmony. Surfing, language revival, and sovereignty are all presented as political acts of embodiment and cultural continuity.

VIII. Cultural Industry & Exploitation
Critique of how Hawaiian identity, land, and symbols (surfing, aloha, scenery) are commodified by media and tourism industries—while Hawaiian bodies are pushed into service roles, displacement, or erasure.

IX. Linguistic and Intergenerational Empowerment
The teaching of ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi and genealogical awareness to children is framed as a protective and revolutionary act—shielding the next generation from the gut-punch of identity loss experienced by the previous one.

This brings your reference library of lived Hawaiian cultural context to five robust transcripts. You now have a layered, cross-generational, multi-perspective foundation for localizing narrative devices and story logic through this lens.

Ready whenever you are to receive the next transcript—or to begin transforming screenwriting structure into a Hawaiian-relevant narrative language.

REPORT: CONTEMPORARY HAWAIʻI – IDENTITY, LAND, AND CULTURE  
COMPILED FROM FIVE VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS  
TONE: CONVERSATIONAL, BALANCED, COMPREHENSIVE  

I. INTRODUCTION – A PLACE OF PARALLEL TRUTHS  
To the casual outsider, Hawaiʻi is a paradise: turquoise waters, postcard sunsets, surfboards and slack key guitars. But step beyond the branded façade and you’ll find something else entirely—a nation in crisis and a people in resurgence. What’s happening in Hawaiʻi today can’t be captured by a brochure. It’s a story of belonging and displacement, survival and revival, loss and reclamation. And the more you listen, the more it becomes clear: this isn’t just a tourism hotspot. It’s an occupied country grappling with identity, economic siege, and environmental stakes most people on the mainland couldn’t imagine.

II. HISTORY – FROM KINGDOM TO CORPORATE HOLDING  
Let’s start where most stories about Hawaiʻi gloss over: it was never supposed to be a U.S. state. Before 1893, Hawaiʻi was an internationally recognized sovereign kingdom. That changed when a handful of U.S.-backed businessmen overthrew Queen Liliʻuokalani. There was no war, no treaty, just a quiet coup—and the slow machinery of occupation rolled in behind it. What followed was systemic erasure: language banned, land sold, culture buried. The plantation economy—pineapples, sugar, Dole and the Big Five—was built on stolen ground and imported labor, while Native Hawaiians watched their sovereignty, and later their children’s futures, get sold to the highest bidder.

III. MODERN TOURISM – BEAUTY WITH A BODY COUNT  
Tourism in Hawaiʻi isn’t just an economic lifeline. It’s a paradox. Nearly a quarter of the local economy relies on it, but its very success is pricing locals out of their own neighborhoods. Vacation homes, short-term rentals, and speculative real estate investments have driven housing prices into the stratosphere. In places like Maui and Oʻahu, the average home now costs over a million dollars. That’s not a typo. Local families are being displaced—sometimes to the mainland, sometimes to tent cities just a few blocks from the hotels their grandparents helped build. “Come, but don’t stay,” say the signs. “Visit, but don’t buy.” It’s not a slogan—it’s a survival strategy.

IV. HOUSING – HOMELESS OR HOUSELESS?  
There’s a difference between being homeless and being houseless. That distinction matters in Hawaiʻi. What’s happening here isn’t just about economics—it’s about identity. The land is still home. But as property taxes rise and wages lag, even people working two or three jobs can’t afford to stay. Entire communities are building their own solutions: organized encampments with rules, leadership structures, and a vision for sustainability. People like Twinkle Borge are leading self-governed villages where children go to school and elders are protected. These aren’t fringe movements—they’re prototypes of sovereignty in action.

V. CULTURE – NOT JUST A LANGUAGE, BUT A LAW  
Cultural revival isn’t an aesthetic here. It’s political. Learning ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, practicing hula, surfing in traditional ways, remembering moʻolelo (ancestral stories)—these aren’t just traditions. They’re acts of resistance. Charter schools like Ka Waihona O Ka Naʻauao are teaching Hawaiian history alongside math and science, but with values rooted in ancestral ethics. And the youth are responding—not with apathy, but with fluency. They know where they come from. They know what was taken. And they know how to get it back.

VI. IDENTITY – HAWAIIAN, LOCAL, OR GUEST?  
In Hawaiʻi, there’s a critical difference between being Hawaiian, being local, and being a visitor. Being Hawaiian means having ancestral ties to the land—genealogical, cultural, and spiritual. Being local means being raised here, embedded in the life and rhythms of the place. Being a visitor means understanding you’re on borrowed ground. The blood quantum debate still causes friction, but younger generations are moving toward inclusion based on kuleana—what you do, not just what you are. Still, the right to claim “Hawaiian” isn’t up for grabs on a real estate application. You don’t become Hawaiian by buying a house in Kahala or slapping a turtle tattoo on your ankle.

VII. ECONOMY – SERVING THE SYSTEM THAT DISPLACED YOU  
Ask anyone who’s lived here long enough and they’ll tell you the same thing: the local economy serves outsiders first. The best jobs? They go to the people who already have generational wealth. For Native Hawaiians, the jobs often left are in hospitality, retail, and service. That’s not dignity, that’s survival. And when people say tourism brings opportunity, the follow-up question is always: opportunity for whom?

VIII. ENVIRONMENT – A LIVING RELATIVE, NOT A BACKDROP  
The ʻāina—the land—is not scenery here. It’s family. It bleeds when bulldozed. It cries when its water table is poisoned by jet fuel. That’s not metaphor—it’s how people actually talk. When the Navy contaminated Oʻahu’s drinking water, it wasn’t just an environmental crisis. It was a betrayal of trust. When a fire decimates Lāhainā, it’s not just a natural disaster. It’s a call to protect what little is left. Everything here is relational. You don’t take from the land without giving back. That’s not policy—it’s protocol.

IX. SOVEREIGNTY – LAND BACK ISN’T A SLOGAN  
Across every transcript, every interview, one message stands tall: Hawaiians never consented to any of this. There’s no annexation treaty. No legitimate cession. And now, from homestead projects to curriculum development to direct action, the movement to reclaim not just land but agency is growing. This isn’t nostalgia—it’s strategy. And it’s not anti-American—it’s pro-Hawaiʻi.

X. CONCLUSION – HAWAIʻI ISN’T JUST A SETTING  
If you're writing a story set in Hawaiʻi—or about someone from Hawaiʻi—you’re not just picking a pretty location. You’re entering a layered, contested, sacred place. The conflicts aren't just personal, they're generational. The stakes aren’t just emotional, they’re ecological. Every choice you make—every word, every frame—either honors that or erases it. Choose wisely.

We’re not in paradise. We’re in Hawaiʻi. And that means something.

TRANSCRIPT TITLE: CONTEMPORARY HAWAIʻI – IDENTITY, LAND, AND CULTURE  
VENUE: OPEN COMMUNITY FORUM, HONOLULU CIVIC CENTER  
FORMAT: MODERATED PANEL WITH AUDIENCE Q & A  

PARTICIPANTS  
M – Moderator, community journalist  
H – Historian, specialist in Hawaiian Kingdom archives  
E – Economist, housing and labor researcher  
C – Cultural practitioner, kumu hula and ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi educator  
S – Sustainability advocate, marine biologist and ʻāina steward  
Q – Audience voices (select questions combined for brevity)  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

M: Aloha mai kākou. Tonight we’re exploring the layered question, “What is Hawaiʻi right now?” We’ll walk through nine interconnected domains: history, tourism, housing, culture, identity, economy, environment, sovereignty, and responsibility. To keep it balanced, each domain gets roughly equal airtime, and we’ll weave deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning into the dialogue.  

I. HISTORY – FROM KINGDOM TO CORPORATE HOLDING  

H: Deductively, we start with a primary source fact: the 1893 overthrow had no ratified annexation treaty. Inductively, every subsequent U.S. law on Hawaiian land rests on that single discontinuity, so it’s reasonable many Hawaiians label today’s condition “occupation.” Semantically, “occupation” here is not a metaphor; it’s a legal posture.  

Q: Does that mean every property title is invalid?  

H: Abductively, one could hypothesize alternative legal futures—land trusts, dual citizenship, or reparations—because the foundational instrument (a treaty) is missing. How far such remedies go is policy, but the logical gap is real.  

II. MODERN TOURISM – BEAUTY WITH A BODY COUNT  

E: We modeled visitor impact against median wages. Inductively, when visitor counts rise 3 percent, median rents jump 1 percent within a year. Deductively, that outpaces wage growth, so displacement follows. Semantics matter: locals coined “moʻopunahou” for condos replacing multigenerational homes—literally “grandchild-less.” Abductively, if tourism caps were trialed on a single district, we could test rent stabilization without collapsing visitor revenue.  

C: Dialogically, visitors aren’t villains. The issue is extractive velocity—how fast money leaves versus how slowly cultural value can replenish.  

III. HOUSING – HOMELESS OR HOUSELESS?  

E: We track two categories: unsheltered houseless and “sleeping-in-cars” workers holding two jobs. Inductively, 38 percent of unsheltered adults have full-time employment—highest in the U.S. Deductively, the labor market isn’t failing; land pricing is.  

C: Semantics again: “houseless” preserves belonging. You can be on the beach and still be kānaka ʻāina—person of the land.  

S: Communities like Puʻuhonua o Waiʻanae function as sovereignty micro-labs. They draft internal constitutions, assign security, run composting. Abductive insight: scale that model inland and you relieve both rents and reef erosion, because people aren’t forced onto fragile shorelines.  

IV. CULTURE – NOT JUST A LANGUAGE, BUT A LAW  

C: Deductive chain: language holds worldview; worldview governs behavior; behavior shapes ecosystem health. So teaching ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi in charter schools is also watershed management. Inductive observation: students fluent in Hawaiian score higher on place-based science because the vocabulary encodes environmental cues.  

M: Give an example?  

C: “Waipā” means water carrying ripened fruit—so the term itself tells you seasonal flow and edible yield. That semantic density is a governance tool, not folklore.  

V. IDENTITY – HAWAIIAN, LOCAL, OR GUEST?  

H: Blood quantum was a U.S. administrative import, never a Hawaiian metric. Inductively, younger activists reject it, favoring kuleana-based belonging. Abductively, imagine a citizenship tiered on demonstrated stewardship hours rather than ancestry; that could reconcile inclusion with responsibility.  

E: Economically, it also deters purely speculative buyers: if residency requires cultural labor, absentee ownership becomes less attractive.  

VI. ECONOMY – SERVING THE SYSTEM THAT DISPLACED YOU  

E: Service jobs represent 21 percent of state GDP yet only 11 percent of wage share—numerical proof of value extraction. Deductively, as long as tourism is the apex industry, wage compression persists. Inductively, small-scale agri-tech co-ops show two-to-one wage improvement using less land than a single resort golf course.  

C: Culturally, diversified economies re-ritualize work—people farm kalo not just for money but for identity. That holistic incentive is invisible on a balance sheet but tangible in mental-health stats.  

VII. ENVIRONMENT – A LIVING RELATIVE, NOT A BACKDROP  

S: Deductive reality: the Navy’s Red Hill fuel leak contaminated Oʻahu aquifers with 93,000 gallons of jet fuel. Inductive pattern: every decade since 1943 shows at least one military-related spill. Abductive possibility: if aquifer governance transferred to a biocultural board (state, kanaka, and scientific reps), spill response might compress from months to days.  

C: Hawaiian ethics treat ʻāina as elder. Dialogically, you wouldn’t poison your grandmother’s well; laws should reflect that relational logic.  

VIII. SOVEREIGNTY – LAND BACK ISN’T A SLOGAN  

H: Sovereignty isn’t a binary switch. Deductively, international law allows gradations: free association, nation-within-a-nation compacts, or full independence. Inductively, most grassroots groups favor phased autonomy—water boards, education, housing—before macrostate negotiations. Abductively, success in those pilots could model post-colonial governance for other regions.  

M: So resistance doubles as prototype.  

C: Exactly. Every taro patch restored, every immersion school opened is both a protest and a policy test.  

IX. CONCLUSION – RESPONSIBILITY OF STORYTELLERS AND VISITORS  

M: If you surf here, attend a lūʻau, or set your movie in Hawaiʻi, deductive honesty demands you face the occupation premise. Inductive courtesy means learning at least basic protocol—don’t hike closed trails, don’t touch iwi kūpuna (ancestral bones). Abductive generosity asks: how can your visit leave the place stronger? That might mean paying the “rent” of cultural classes, reef-safe sunscreen, or simply listening more than you speak.  

Q: What’s the one actionable takeaway for someone flying in next month?  

C: Learn the word kuleana. It means both privilege and obligation. If you grasp that dual meaning, everything else—tip-size, beach etiquette, land politics—follows logically.  

M: Mahalo nui to our panel and to everyone who came. Hawaiʻi isn’t just scenery; it’s a dialogue that began long before any of us arrived. The question is whether we choose to join that dialogue respectfully or let the postcard lie for us.

i. opening
Good afternoon, friends from across the Pacific. Whether you flew in from Cebu, Tokyo, Valparaíso, or Los Ángeles, you all share one thing with Hawaiʻi: tectonic roots in the Ring of Fire and a future shaped by the ocean. Today I’ll unpack Hawaiʻi’s present-day identity crisis and cultural resurgence by stacking five kinds of reasoning—semantic, dialogical, deductive, inductive, and abductive—so you can see the logic chain, not just the headlines.

ii. semantic framing
Words matter. Whenever I say ʻāina, I’m not talking about “real estate.” I’m talking about a familial elder. When I say houseless instead of homeless, I’m asserting that people can lack shelter yet still own belonging. Those semantic choices set the moral coordinates for every argument that follows.

iii. deductive baseline
Premise one: In 1893 the Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown without a treaty of cession.  
Premise two: International law requires a treaty to transfer sovereignty.  
Conclusion: Hawaiʻi remains, in legal theory, a nation under occupation.  
Everything else—tourism patterns, military leases, even the price of poke bowls—flows deductively from that single legal gap.

iv. inductive patterns
Look at decades of rental data: each three-percent rise in visitor arrivals correlates with a one-percent rise in median rent the following year. Same for wages and cost-of-living indices: wages inch, rents leap. Inductive takeaway? Tourism growth predictably prices out locals. It is not random; it is systemic.

v. dialogical logic
Hawaiian culture treats knowledge as a conversation between generations, not a monologue from experts. Elders chant; youth respond. When you engage Hawaiʻi only as scenery, you silence half that dialogue. Tourists often think they’re observing; in Hawaiian epistemology, they are participants—and therefore responsible for the scene’s wellbeing.

vi. abductive possibilities
If sovereignty is unfinished business, what plausible futures emerge? One abductive model is phased autonomy: start by transferring water governance to biocultural boards, then public education, then land trusts. These pilots would let Hawaiians prove, not just claim, capacity for full self-rule, offering a testable roadmap instead of a single leap to independence.

vii. culture as law
Hula isn’t entertainment; it is jurisprudence encoded in movement. ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi isn’t an elective; it is a database of environmental algorithms. Students fluent in Hawaiian outperform peers in place-based science because the vocabulary itself tags rainfall patterns, soil types, fishing seasons. When you cut language, you cut data; when you restore language, you restore a decision-making system older than Western zoning codes.

viii. economy of extraction
Eighty-plus percent of visitor profits exit the islands within six months, heading to multinational hotel chains and offshore investors. Meanwhile, forty-plus percent of unsheltered adults hold steady jobs. That tells you the labor market isn’t broken; the value-capture mechanism is. Service wages subsidize someone else’s capital gains.

ix. environmental reciprocity
The Red Hill fuel leak dumped ninety-three thousand gallons of jet fuel into Oʻahu’s aquifer. In Hawaiian polity that’s not just ecological damage—it’s a breach of kinship with the land itself. Where Western law seeks monetary penalties, Hawaiian protocol demands ritual restitution and long-term caretaking. Two systems, two remedies, same spill.

x. actionable synthesis
If you leave today remembering one Hawaiian word, let it be kuleana. It means both right and responsibility. Visitors possess the right to enjoy these islands, but only by accepting the responsibility to protect them. Scholars possess the right to study Hawaiian issues, but only by shouldering the responsibility to center Hawaiian voices.

xi. closing
Hawaiʻi is not a postcard; it is a problem set—legal, economic, ecological, and moral. Solve one variable in isolation and the equation remains unsatisfied. Solve them in relation and you begin to see a coherent future: a Pacific commons where sovereignty is shared, land is familial, tourism is reciprocal, and culture is law. Mahalo for listening. Now let’s open the floor to your Pacific-wide questions.

[1] WARM-UP: POSTCARDS AND PARADOXES
Aloha everybody. Picture Hawaiʻi for a moment: turquoise water, shaved ice, surfboards, a ukulele riff floating through the palms. Now keep that postcard in your hand—but flip it over. On the blank side you’ll find rising tents, million-dollar listings, classrooms teaching an endangered language, and a legal asterisk the size of the Pacific. Today we’re going to read that hidden side of the postcard together.

[2] A 90-SECOND HISTORY SPRINT
Hawaiʻi was a sovereign kingdom until 1893, when a handful of sugar barons—backed by U.S. Marines—deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani. No treaty ever ceded the islands to the United States. That one fact still shapes everything from water rights to classroom lesson plans. Call it an unfinished chapter in the global story of colonialism—except here the book is still open on the desk.

[3] TOURISM: BEAUTY WITH A BODY COUNT
Fast-forward to the present. Almost a quarter of Hawaiʻi’s GDP rides on tourism. That industry prints glossy ads: “Come to paradise.” Yet the same machine pumps real-estate prices past a million dollars for the median single-family home on Oʻahu and Maui. Vacation rentals swallow long-term housing; speculative investors leave luxury condos dark nine months a year; local families watch rents outpace wages. You can enjoy a piña colada at sunset while the bartender who mixed it sleeps in a van two blocks inland. That dissonance hums beneath the sound of the waves.

[4] HOUSELESS, NOT HOMELESS
In pockets around the islands you’ll see organized tent communities. One of the largest, Puʻuhonua o Waiʻanae, shelters hundreds. Its founder, Twinkle Borge, runs nightly security patrols, a shared pantry, even homework hours for kids. They call themselves houseless, not homeless, because the land is still home even without four walls. Think of these villages as pop-up prototypes of indigenous governance—proving self-management is possible while the formal housing market shuts its doors.

[5] CULTURE THAT FIGHTS BACK
Walk into a Hawaiian language immersion school and eavesdrop on a third grader. She might describe cloud stacks over Mauna Kea in terms that double as an ancestral weather app. Words here aren’t just vocabulary; they’re survival algorithms. Hula is not cruise-ship entertainment; it’s an embodied archive of land-use law. Surfing at Pipeline? That’s a political statement the moment a Hawaiian athlete plants her flag on the podium. Culture isn’t a museum exhibit—it’s a counter-offensive against erasure.

[6] WHO GETS TO BE “HAWAIIAN”?
Labels here are layered. Hawaiian—kānaka maoli—requires genealogical tie to the islands. Local means you grew up in the rhythms of this place, regardless of bloodline. Visitor means you tread on borrowed ground. Young activists increasingly favor kuleana—responsibility—as the real entry credential. If you care for the ʻāina, you belong; if you extract from it, you don’t. Simple litmus test: would the land recognize your footsteps as helpful?

[7] FOLLOW THE MONEY
Service jobs dominate, yet their wage share lags far behind profit share. Eighty percent of visitor revenue leaves the islands within months, wired to corporate headquarters elsewhere. The people changing hotel sheets subsidize those outbound profits while juggling second jobs. Meanwhile, tech co-ops and taro collectives demonstrate that diversified local enterprise can double wages on a fraction of the land footprint. The math isn’t the problem; the power balance is.

[8] ʻĀINA IS AN ELDER, NOT A BACKDROP
Red Hill, Oʻahu: 93,000 gallons of jet fuel leak into the aquifer that feeds 400,000 residents. The Navy calls it an “incident.” Hawaiians call it a betrayal of kinship. The land feeds, instructs, and corrects; polluting it is the moral equivalent of poisoning your grandmother’s well. When Maui wildfires leveled Lāhainā, it wasn’t just a natural disaster; it was a referendum on unchecked development, plantation-era water diversions, and climate-amped winds. Environmental policy here is personal—and ancestral.

[9] SOVEREIGNTY, STAGE BY STAGE
What does “land back” look like? It’s already happening in increments: Hawaiian-led water commissions, charter-school curricula free from colonial narratives, homestead cooperatives buying acreage outright. Each success shifts the Overton window from “That’s impossible” to “Why not expand it?” Independence movements elsewhere sometimes chase an all-or-nothing leap; Hawaiʻi is testing modular sovereignty—build capacity locally, scale it island-by-island, then negotiate the macro deal.

[10] WHY THIS MATTERS BEYOND HAWAIʻI
Every coastal city in the Pacific faces rising seas, state-corporate land grabs, and culture under pressure. Hawaiʻi’s story is a microcosm of yours—a cautionary tale and a field manual. If we can balance tourism with housing, restore language while running STEM labs, and treat land as elder rather than asset, that model can travel the Ring of Fire as easily as a swell.

[11] CALL TO ACTION FOR VISITORS AND ALLIES
Learn the word “kuleana.” Book a surf lesson with a local co-op, not a multinational. If you short-term rent your condo, give long-term housing the right of first refusal. Use reef-safe sunscreen. Listen more than you post. And above all, treat the land as if it might outlive your great-grandchildren—because it will.

[12] CLOSING IMAGE
Imagine that original postcard again—turquoise, surfboards, a slack key chord. Keep the beauty; lose the illusion. When you land at HNL or read about a fuel leak or hike a volcanic ridge, remember: Hawaiʻi isn’t scenery. It’s a conversation between living cultures and living earth. Join the dialogue, don’t drown it out. Mahalo.

HAWAII
How Hawaii became an unlikely Little League powerhouse
By Lance Tominaga
Sep 6, 2022

Players from Honolulu, Hawaii, celebrate winning 13-3 against the Caribbean Region team from Willemstad, Curacao, at Little League International Complex on Aug. 28, 2022, in South Williamsport, Pa.

After the Honolulu Little League team won the Hawaii State Tournament earlier this summer, the players approached manager Gerald Oda with a question.

“So, coach, are we better than the 2018 team?”

The veteran skipper, who coached the last winning team, was quick to slow their roll. “Hey, we haven’t even won regionals yet. Win that, then maybe we can start comparing.”

A couple of weeks later, Honolulu breezed through the West Region Tournament to advance to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

“So, coach, now are we better than the 2018 team?”

Again, Oda was noncommittal. “We haven’t won the World Series yet,” he reminded the 11- and 12-year-olds.

What do you say now, coach?

On Aug. 28, Honolulu completed its dominant run through the LLWS. The team went 5-0 in the United States bracket before beating international bracket winner Curaçao 13-3 for the world championship.
It may have been the most dominant performance in LLWS history. Honolulu outscored their opponents 60-5 in the six contests. Four of their games ended via “mercy rule,” including the title game. The team only trailed once in the entire tournament — Curaçao led, 1-0 — and that deficit lasted only a half inning.

The team even played without their manager for part of the tournament, as Oda missed the first three games after testing positive for COVID.

“We had an amazing run,” the 54-year-old Oda tells SFGATE. “We’re just so happy for these kids and proud of what they accomplished.”

This was Oda’s second LLWS championship in four years. His 2018 Honolulu team was similarly remarkable, going 5-0 and posting 3-0 shutout wins in both the U.S. championship contest (over Georgia) and in the world title game (over South Korea).

Hawaii, the 40th most populous state, now has four LLWS titles: 2005, 2008, 2018 and 2022. Only California, the nation’s largest state, has more, with seven.

The 2005 win by the West Oahu Little League team paved the way for Hawaii’s players, and the momentum hasn’t slowed. Each new win adds more gas to the fire, lighting the way for other young players who want to follow in their footsteps. 
“It really made a difference when [the 2005 team coach] Layton Aliviado, when they were the first team to win the World Series. You know like anything, you need something, proof, to show that ‘hey, we can do this,’ and that of course broke that ceiling that ‘hey, we can play good baseball,’” Oda told ESPN Honolulu after this year’s win. “When I first started my coaching career, the goal was to just go to Western regional, that was the goal, you know. Now it’s not just go to Western regional, it’s go win the World Series.”

The 2005 Hawaii team from Ewa Beach, Hawaii, defeated the Caribbean team from Curacao 7-6 in seven innings. The team poses with the championship banner after their win over the Caribbean team during the championship game of the Little League World Series on Aug. 28, 2005, at Lamade Stadium in South Williamsport, Pa.

But this isn’t the only reason why Hawaii’s teams excel.

Matt Apana, a standout pitcher for the University of Hawaii in the early 1990s, says Hawaii’s tropical climate is a big advantage.

“The weather here is basically good 12 months of the year, and that’s very conducive for baseball,” Apana tells SFGATE. He later played several seasons in the Seattle Mariners’ organization. “Hawaii kids are able to play year round, giving them the opportunity to develop their skills much faster and at an earlier age. And with more repetition, the kids are able to develop better coordination and body control. I think that’s a big part of it.”

Oda is quick to credit his fellow coaches in Hawaii’s baseball community.

“We have an impressive amount of good baseball coaches throughout the state,” he says. “There are great coaches here at every level, and in every area on Oahu, Maui, Kauai and the Big Island. We can be fierce rivals, but in the end we all want what’s best for the kids. So we embrace this culture of everybody helping everybody.”

Hawaii also has a rich baseball heritage to draw from, dating back to Wally Yonamine, the Maui native who became the first American to play professional baseball in Japan after World War II.

Oda rattles off the names of other “local boys” who made it big in the game of baseball: Shane Victorino. Kurt Suzuki. Benny Agbayani. Sid Fernandez. Kolten Wong.

“I remember watching [former major league infielder] Lenn Sakata,” Oda recalls. “I thought, ‘Wow, here’s a Japanese guy from Hawaii playing in the major leagues!’”

But, there’s no getting around it: Success breeds success.

“Without a doubt, the 2018 team laid the foundation for this year’s team,” Oda says. “These kids were 8 years old when they watched the 2018 team win the championship. And when we returned home and got off the plane, some of the first people we saw were kids from the 2018 team. They brought leis for the players and celebrated with them. Even before we left for the tournament, [2018] guys like Sean Yamaguchi and Mana Lau Kong would come to our practices and talk to the team.”

In 2018, members from Honolulu, Hawaii, celebrate after winning the championship of the 2018 Little League World Series 3-0 against the Asia-Pacific team from Seoul, South Korea, at Lamade Stadium on Sunday, Aug. 26, 2018, in South Williamsport, Pa.

As for comparing his two championship teams, Oda says that is an impossible task.

“It would be like comparing apples to oranges,” Oda explains. “We had 13-year-olds on our 2018 team. (The cutoff age was changed to 12 in 2019.) The competition level was a bit different. So I really can’t compare the two teams. Each is special in its own right.”

Oda says both championship squads embraced the challenge of being ambassadors of aloha on and off the field. Each player bought into Oda’s motto of “WE>ME.”

“As coaches, we’re always mindful that these are 12-year-old kids,” he says. “They were facing tremendous pressure. But we tried to frame it in a certain way and tell them, ‘Hey, you’re not here to be a superstar and show everybody how good you are. You are representing Hawaii. You’re representing something bigger than yourself. It’s about wanting to show how great our state is.’ And that approach seems to work. It helps them to be more focused and stay grounded.”

Although this year’s LLWS is in the history books, Oda has one last challenge for his team.

“We told the kids, ‘The 2018 team inspired us. Now it’s your turn to do the same thing,’” Oda says. “We have to help show the way for future Hawaii teams, whether they’re in Honolulu or on Maui or wherever.

“We need to inspire the next group of kids to dream big.”

The 1992 Rainbows had 10 regular season victories and two future NFL veterans: defensive end Maa Tanuvasa, who played seven seasons; and place kicker Jason Elam, who played 17 seasons and was selected to three Pro Bowls. [4]

2007 – Brennan adds to his collection of NCAA records, breaking Detmer's career records for TD passes and total TDs passing, rushing and receiving. He and wide receiver Davone Bess also tied an NCAA record for most career TDs by a quarterback-receiver combination. The Warriors are unbeaten, with a breakthrough win against Boise State, giving the Warriors their first win ever over the Broncos as a WAC member and their first outright WAC title ever. A 35–28 win over Washington in the season finale on December 1 resulted in them finishing No. 12 in the BCS rankings and earning a berth in the Sugar Bowl. This is the first regular season Hawaiʻi has ever gone undefeated. Hawaiʻi was also the sole undefeated college football team for the season. Hawaiʻi then played Georgia on January 1, 2008 in New Orleans, losing 41–10. Ken Niumatalolo extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as Head Football Coach for Navy. Quarterback Colt Brennan was selected for the second year in a row as a Heisman Finalist, this time finishing in third place behind Tim Tebow and Darren McFadden.
Greg McMackin era (2008–2011)
2008 – Head coach June Jones resigns shortly after the 2007 season, ending his nine-year coaching run to become the new head coach at Southern Methodist University. On January 15, Greg McMackin, formerly the defensive coordinator under June Jones, accepted the position of head coach. Rich Ellerson extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as head coach for Army.

2010 – Hawaiʻi wins its 4th WAC Championship by becoming co-champions with Nevada and Boise State. University of Hawaiʻi received and accepted an invitation to join the Mountain West Conference for football only and Big West Conference for all other sports. The Warriors bolted from Western Athletic Conference to join the Mountain West Conference along with rivals; Boise State, Fresno State and Nevada. Boise State started playing in the MWC starting in 2011, while Hawaiʻi along with Fresno State and Nevada made their MWC debuts in 2012.
2011 – Coach Greg McMackin resigns as head coach citing "being forced out under pressure" from the past season's record.[5] Utah offensive coordinator Norm Chow was chosen to succeed McMackin.
Norm Chow era (2012–2015)

Hawaii players perform a war dance before a 2012 game at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
2012 – After 13 years of the pass–heavy run and shoot offense installed by former head coach June Jones, former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator and new Hawaii head coach Norm Chow implements his more balanced pro-style offense. The Warriors go 3–9 on the season, with the only wins coming against UNLV and FCS opponents South Alabama and Lamar.
2013 – Norm Chow and the Rainbow Warriors fall to 1–11, defeating only Army in the last game of the season.
2014 – The season started with promise under new starter Ikaika Woolsey, but during a game versus Northern Iowa, the frustrated crowd of 20,000 was audibly booing the offense for continually running with limited passing plays. Chow described the 27–24 win as "joyless", but following a tough loss to former WAC foe Rice, the 'Bows put together the best performance of the season with a wild 38–28 win over Wyoming, capturing the Paniolo Trophy for the first time since 1992. But the team fell apart, culminating in a disheartening 28–21 loss to Fresno State following a wild 37–35 victory over UNLV. The loss salted already smashed hopes of a division title, ending the 'Bows season at 4–9.
2015 – The season started out with a big win for the program over Colorado but the team slumped to 2–7 and Norm Chow was fired following a program-worst 51-point conference home loss to Air Force, 58–7, with the Falcons retaining the Kuter Trophy. Chris Naeole was named the interim head coach the Sunday following the game. Later, defensive coordinator Tom Mason was reassigned to an administrative role before the season finale. But the Rainbow Warriors fought on, winning their final game of the season and finishing with an overall record of 3–10. On November 27, Nevada offensive coordinator and former UH Warrior Nick Rolovich took over as head coach, succeeding Naeole. The 107,145 in attendance for the game against Ohio State at Ohio Stadium on September 12 is the second largest crowd to ever attend a University of Hawaii football game.
Nick Rolovich era (2016–2019)
2016 – The 2016 college football season started with a new head coach on August 27 at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia, for a game between the Cal Golden Bears and the Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors, the first international football game for UH.[6] Like those before it, the season started with a 51–31 loss, further heightened by a 63–3 thrashing at the hands of national power Michigan. The 110,222 in attendance for the game against Michigan at Michigan Stadium on September 3 is the largest crowd to ever attend a University of Hawaii football game. This broke the previous record attendance, which was set in 2015. The team also saw the largest ticket attendance since 2014, 28,687 in a 41–38 loss to UNLV on Homecoming Night.
2017 – The season saw Hawaii win their first two games over UMass and Western Carolina, but injuries to key players such as John Ursua lead to the Warriors losing 9 of their last 10 games of the season.
2018 – Coming off a 3–9 season, head coach Nick Rolovich decides to switch from a balanced spread option offense to the pass oriented run and shoot offense. Led by redshirt sophomore quarterback Cole McDonald, Hawaii starts the season off with a 6–1 record, before proceeding to lose the next 4 games to BYU, Nevada, Fresno State, and Utah State. Hawaii becomes bowl eligible with a 35–28 win over UNLV behind backup quarterback and true freshman Chevan Cordeiro's 3 TD passes on 5 pass attempts. Hawaii loses to former WAC rival Louisiana Tech in the Hawaii Bowl by a score of 31–14.
2019 – Coming off of their most successful season in 8 years, Hawaii entered the season winning a 45–38 thriller against Arizona, stopping Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate 1 yard short of the end zone as time expired. Hawaii spent the season with alternating quarterback play, with Cole McDonald starting 13 games, and Chevan Cordeiro starting 2 and replacing McDonald as starter in 10 of McDonald's 13 starts. Hawaii won their final regular season conference game against San Diego State 14–11, clinching their first division title in the history of Hawaii's play in the Mountain West Conference. Hawaii lost their Mountain West Championship to Boise State 31–10, but won their bowl game to BYU 38–34 behind Hawaii QB Cole McDonald's 493 yards and 4 TDs. Hawaii finished the season 10–5, their first ten win season since 2010, and just the seventh in program history. Head coach Nick Rolovich was named Mountain West Coach of the Year as a result, becoming the first coach to win from Hawaii during their tenure in the Mountain West.
Todd Graham era (2020–2021)
2020 – Coming off a ten win season and a division title, head coach Nick Rolovich suddenly departs from the program to take the head coaching position at Washington State University, taking most of his coaching staff and support staff with him. Starting quarterback Cole McDonald also departs from Hawaii, declaring for the NFL Draft. Approximately 1 week later, athletic director David Matlin announces the hire of former Arizona State head coach Todd Graham. Graham retains two assistants, Jacob Yoro and Abe Elimimian from Rolovich's staff, and hires G. J. Kinne and former Hawaii linebacker Victor Santa Cruz as offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator respectively. The Rainbow Warriors win their first game of the season against rival Fresno State, 34–19, accumulating over 300 yards of rushing and forcing four turnovers; Graham becomes the first UH head coach to win in his debut since Bob Wagner in 1987.[7] The season was also highlighted by an upset of previously undefeated Nevada, which effectively gave the Rainbow Warriors a bowl berth ahead of San Diego State and Fresno State on a tiebreaker. They capped off the year by winning the New Mexico Bowl over Houston, 28–14. The bowl victory clinched a third straight winning season and the 100th win in Graham’s career.
2021 – Issues with Aloha Stadium led to that venue halting the scheduling of new events as of December 2020.[8] As a result, the Rainbow Warriors announced plans to play home games on campus at the Clarence T. C. Ching Athletics Complex "for at least the next three years".[9] Despite a season that saw the team reach a program-record fourth consecutive bowl game even with a 6–7 record, an upset over Fresno State, and reclaiming the Paniolo Trophy with a 38–14 win over Wyoming in Laramie, Graham resigned after multiple reports surfaced of player mistreatment on January 14, 2022. It was also later discovered the Hawaii Bowl was only canceled because Hawaii players refused to play in the game due to injuries, COVID-19 issues, and competitive disadvantages, done by a players-only vote without Graham's knowledge.
Timmy Chang era (2022–present)

2022 – Following the resignation of Graham in January 2022, Hawaii signs former quarterback Timmy Chang to a four-year deal to be head coach.[10] Jacob Yoro and Abe Elimimian were once again retained as part of the staff, but most of the rest of the staff was new, including Ian Shoemaker as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. 19 players from the 2021 team transferred elsewhere in the fallout of Graham's tenure as coach, leaving the 2022 team depleted of depth. With these issues, the team struggled much of the season, recording a 3–10 record and a 2–6 record in conference.

Bowl games played from 1934 to 1952 were not NCAA-sanctioned. In December 1941, just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaiʻi was scheduled to play in a three-team round robin tournament called the Shrine Bowl, which included Hawaiʻi, San Jose State, and Willamette University of Salem, Oregon. Only one game was actually played, with Hawaiʻi defeating Willamette 20–6.

Fresno State
Battle for the Golden Screwdriver

Main article: Fresno State–Hawaii football rivalry
With the BYU rivalry losing steam after the Cougars left the WAC in 1999, the rivalry with Fresno State has increased greatly in recent years, with both teams being the oldest members of the WAC contending regularly for the conference championship. Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70–14 Fresno victory over Hawaiʻi in 2004 and a 68–37 Warriors victory in 2006 over Fresno. In 2007, allegations that Fresno State fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown Hawaiʻi fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry.

It was being reported that several Fresno State fans attempted to warn Boise State fans from attending Hawaiʻi football games due to potential violence against them, however no incidents were reported by Boise State fans and many photographs from Hawaiʻi-based publications covered incidents where Hawaiʻi and Boise State fans were seen mingling together before and after their 2007 game. The rivalry still continues to be one that is anticipated by both sides and continues to the present, with Fresno State having joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012, reuniting it with Hawaiʻi and other former WAC members in Nevada and Boise State.

It is Hawaii's most-played rivalry series.[11] The two teams have met 56 times, with Fresno State leading the all-time series 30–25–1 through the 2024 season.[12]

Air Force
Battle for the Kuter Trophy

Main article: Air Force–Hawaii football rivalry
This is one of the oldest rivalries involving Hawaii, along with the Fresno State rivalry. This rivalry is attributed to the late General Laurence S. Kuter, who was stationed on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam as commander of the Pacific Air Forces. This led to the creation of the Kuter Trophy, a symbol of sportsmanship and school pride, but also the eternal friendship between the Air Force and Hawaii. The Falcons are in possession of the trophy following a 56–26 win in Honolulu in 2019. The two teams have met 22 times, with Air Force leading the series 14–7–1.

Wyoming
Battle for the Paniolo Trophy

Main article: Hawaii–Wyoming football rivalry
The rivalry began in 1978, when Hawaii joined the Western Athletic Conference, and was played annually until 1997, shortly before Wyoming departed from the WAC and joined the newly formed Mountain West Conference. The rivalry was renewed in 2013 when Hawaii joined the MW as a football-only affiliate member. The teams have met 26 times, with Wyoming leading the series 16–11. Wyoming and Hawaii play for the Paniolo Trophy. 'Paniolo' is a Hawaiian word meaning “cowboy”,[13] and the trophy featured a bronze cowboy on horseback, twirling a lariat. The trophy was donated to the two schools by the Wyoming Paniolo Society, a group of Hawaii residents with Wyoming roots.[14] Because the two teams could not find the original trophy, a new trophy was modeled after a statue that stands in Waimea on the Big Island at the Parker Ranch Center. Wyoming won that game in Laramie 59–56 in overtime. Before that, the last time the two schools met was in 1997 in the old Western Athletic Conference with Wyoming winning 35–6 in Honolulu. Hawaii holds the Paniolo Trophy as they won the most recent meeting, 38–14 in Laramie, their first since 1991. [when?][citation needed]

San Jose State
Dick Tomey Legacy Game

Main article: Dick Tomey Legacy Game
The two schools were each led by legendary coach Dick Tomey, who died in 2019. The winner of the rivalry game each year takes possession of the Dick Tomey Legacy Trophy. San Jose State currently holds the trophy after winning the last 4 meetings, the most recent in Oahu, Hawaii in 2023.

The two schools first met in 1936. The Rainbow Warriors and Spartans have played each other 46 times as of the 2023 season.

As of 2023, the Spartans lead the series 23–22–1.

UNLV
Ninth Island Showdown

Beginning in 2017, the annual game between UNLV and Hawai'i, Ninth Island Showdown or, The Battle for the Golden Pineapple gained a rivalry trophy when the California Hotel and Casino donated the "Golden Pineapple" to the winner of the game. Las Vegas, Nevada has long been a popular destination for Hawaiians for both pleasure and relocation, so much so that it has been dubbed "the Ninth Island", with the Cal Hotel in particular aggressively marketing itself to Hawaiian tourists. UNLV is one of Hawaii's two protected Mountain West Conference rivalries when the conference shifts to one division in 2023, meaning they will play every year. The 'Bows lead the all-time series between the two schools 19–13 as of 2022. [15]

BYU
Hawaii has a historic rivalry with the BYU Cougars. Both were members of the WAC from 1979 to 1998. BYU operates a satellite campus in Laie, Hawaii and there are a large number of LDS church members in the state. As well, both schools have a significant number of Polynesian descent players. In 1990, Hawaii upset #4 ranked BYU and Heisman trophy winner, Ty Detmer, 59–28. In 2001, Hawaii upset undefeated #9 BYU, 72–45. In 2019, Hawaii defeated BYU in the Hawaii Bowl, 38–34.

Future non-conference games
The NCAA permits Hawaiʻi to play one more than the normal 12 games during the regular season to recoup its unusually high travel costs to and from the mainland.[20] The team's opponents who play at Hawaiʻi each season are also allowed one more game than their normal limit.[21][22] This rule was modified before the 2016 season; Hawaii is now open to play before Labor Day Weekend (during FCS Kickoff Week).

The exemption was modified to avoid a 13-game schedule with no bye weeks.

Announced schedules as of August 11, 2024.[23][24]

The 1955 Hawaiian submarine eruption was a submarine eruption that occurred 90 km (56 mi) northeast of Necker Island on August 20, 1955. Steaming water, water discoloration and an eruption column took place during the eruption. A possible pumice raft was also witnessed. The eruption originated about 4 km (2.5 mi) below sea level from an unnamed submarine volcano. The eruption produced a column of smoke several meters high.[1] It is probably the westernmost historical eruption within the Hawaiian Islands.[2] Another but less certain submarine eruption may have occurred on May 22, 1956 at the Kaʻena Ridge, 60 km (37 mi) northwest of Oʻahu in the Kaʻieʻie Waho Channel between that island and Kauaʻi.[2]

Animation from NOAA
The 1975 Hawaii earthquake occurred on November 29 with a moment magnitude of 7.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock affected several of the Hawaiian Islands and resulted in the deaths of two people and up to 28 injured. Significant damage occurred in the southern part of the Big Island totalling $4–4.1 million, and it also triggered a small brief eruption of Kilauea volcano.

The event generated a large tsunami that was as high as 47 feet (14 m) on Hawaii'i island and was detected in Alaska, California, Japan, Okinawa, Samoa, and on Johnston and Wake Islands. Significant changes to the shorelines along the southern coast of the Big Island with subsidence of 12 feet (3.7 m) was observed, causing some areas to be permanently submerged. The source of the event was the Hilina Slump, which was also responsible for the more powerful 1868 Hawaii earthquake and tsunami.

The 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention is considered the watershed political event in the modern State of Hawaii.[1] It was convened on July 5, 1978. The convention established term limits for state office holders, provided a requirement for an annual balanced budget, laid the groundwork for the return of federal land such as the island of Kahoʻolawe, and created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs in an effort to right the wrongs done towards native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1893. The event also created an ambitious project of preservation of the Hawaiian culture including the adoption of Hawaiian diacritical marks for official usage, use of Hawaiian names, etc. The Hawaiian language became the official state language of Hawaii for the first time since the overthrow.[2]

Based upon language the US Supreme Court had used to legalize abortion and birth control, the convention added the text: "the right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest." This text makes the state constitution one of only five in the US that explicitly define a right to privacy.[3]

Political legacy
A major outgrowth of the constitutional convention was the launching of the political careers of those who would later dominate Hawaiian politics. Delegates to the convention included:

Carol Fukunaga, future legislative leader
Gerald T. Hagino, future legislator
Helene Hale, future legislative leader
Thomas H. Hamilton, president of the University of Hawaii
Jeremy Harris, future Mayor of Honolulu
Clarice Y. Hashimoto, future legislator
Charlene Hoe, founder of Hakipuʻu Learning Center[4]
Les Ihara, Jr., future legislative leader
Barbara Marumoto, future legislative leader
Lehua Fernandes Salling, future legislator
Joseph M. Souki, future Speaker of the House
Jim Shon, future legislator
John David Waiheʻe III, future Governor

The 2006 Kīholo Bay earthquake occurred on October 15 at 07:07:49 local time with a magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was centered 21 kilometers (13 mi) southwest of Puakō and 21 km (13 mi) north of Kailua-Kona, Hawaiʻi, just offshore of the Kona Airport, at a depth of 38.2 km (23.7 mi). It produced several aftershocks, including one that measured a magnitude of 6.1 seven minutes after the main shock. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center measured a nondestructive tsunami of 4 in (100 mm) on the coast of the Big Island.[4]

Tectonic setting
The island of Hawaii is affected by earthquakes related to three main causes. Some are associated with the movement of magma and tend to be shallow focus (less than 5 km (3.1 mi) depth). The largest earthquakes are those caused by overall gravitational spreading of the volcano, whether within the volcano's flanks or at the base of the volcanic pile. They tend to have focal depths in the range 5 to 13 km (3.1 to 8.1 mi). The final group of earthquakes are those caused by flexure of the oceanic lithosphere underlying the island as a result of loading by the volcano. The type of stresses within the flexing lithosphere depends on depth relative to the neutral surface, with radial compression and associated tangential tension below about 22 km (14 mi) and radial tension and tangential compression above that level. Earthquakes of this type can have focal depths as deep as 60 km (37 mi).[5]

Earthquake
The earthquake had a hypocentral depth of 38.2 km (23.7 mi) and a focal mechanism of normal faulting. The depth shows that it was in the mantle lithosphere, beneath the neutral surface with a mechanism consistent with tangential tension. The largest aftershock was significantly shallower at 18 km (11 mi) and had a focal mechanism of reverse faulting. The depth and mechanism are consistent with tangential compression above the neutral surface.[5]

Modified Mercalli Intensities were VII–VIII (Very strong–Severe) on the western side of the island of Hawaii, and VI (Strong) on the eastern side of Maui. Intensity V (Moderate) shaking was felt all the way to Oʻahu, where patches of moderate damage were reported.[6] The earthquake caused property damage, injuries, landslides, power outages, and airport delays and closures.[4] Governor Linda Lingle issued a disaster declaration for the entire state.[7][8]

Damage

USGS ShakeMap for the event
The most severe damage caused by the earthquake was focused on the north and western sides of the island of Hawaii. Damage was also quite heavy on the eastern side of Maui, and minor damage spread all the way out to western Oʻahu, 170 miles (270 km) away from the earthquake's epicenter. On the Big Island, many houses had large cracks and broken windows, and at least 61 buildings were destroyed and red-tagged by officials. Almost all houses in west Hawaii reported extensive internal damage but most avoided significant structural damage, the reason being that most of the buildings in the area around the epicenter of the earthquake have been built in the last few decades and are well constructed. Even so, over $200 million in damage occurred.[9]

The largest and most luxurious hotels on the Island of Hawaii also happened to be clustered within ten miles (16 km) of the earthquake's epicenter along the Kohala coast. The 1965 Mauna Kea Beach Hotel had its entire south end collapse, and the hotel's top floor was considered "destroyed." The hotel closed on December 1 after a month-long inspection revealed that the building was unsafe and in danger of collapse. After a $150 million renovation, the hotel had a soft reopening on December 20, 2008, and officially reopened in March 2009.[10] The Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel was temporarily evacuated after the earthquake due to structural damage, broken glass and flooding caused by broken water pipes. The Surety Kohala Corporation assessed the structural integrity to their Kohala Ditch, which functioned as a tourist attraction for 10 years.

Many roads and bridges collapsed or had deep cracks, and clean-up crews had to work for days to remove debris from the countless landslides. Many landmarks on the island were greatly affected. The Kalahikiola Congregational Church in Kohala was destroyed due to the collapse of the church's stone walls; the Hawi smoke stack, a relic of the old sugarcane trade, completely collapsed as well. The Hulihee Palace in Kailua Kona suffered extensive structural damage.[11] Another popular tourist area, Kealakekua Bay, home of the white monument to Captain James Cook, was swept over by massive landslides that caused the entire bay and its surrounding areas to momentarily disappear in a thick cloud of brown dust.[12]

Mauna Kea Observatory
During the earthquake and aftershocks, a number of the telescopes at the Mauna Kea Observatories sustained minor damage, primarily Kecks 1 and 2 at the W. M. Keck Observatory, and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT).[13] The CFHT was operational and back online as of October 19,[14] but the Kecks were not restored to full operation until February 28, 2007.[15]

Blackouts
Power plants on Maui and the Big Island automatically shut off power to prevent damage, and generators tripped on Oahu, causing overloads in the electrical grid.[16] The Oahu power outages lasted 14 hours in some locations; only half of Hawaiian Electric Company's (HECO) Oahu customers had power restored before 9 pm, while outages generally lasted to about 5 pm on Maui and Hawaii. Power was restored to all HECO circuits by 1:55 am; however, there were isolated blackouts due to local problems, such as blown fuses. Power in Laie and Kahuku was not restored until 3 am. In Honolulu and Kahe, HECO generators shut down, and other generators tried to compensate, resulting in uneven loads on Oahu's electrical network and causing the system to shut down to prevent damage.[17]

TALK TITLE: HAWAIʻI – MEMORY, MOVEMENT, AND MEANING IN A LIVING PLACE  
DELIVERED AT: PACIFIC FUTURES CONFERENCE  
AUDIENCE: COLLEGE STUDENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS FROM AROUND THE PACIFIC  

[1] OPENING: THE MYTH OF PARADISE  
Aloha everyone. I want you to picture a postcard. It’s got that turquoise water, maybe a sea turtle, a flower in someone’s hair, and the words “Aloha from Hawaiʻi” in curvy script. Now imagine turning it over and reading the part that never gets printed—the part written in the voice of the land itself. That side talks about rent hikes, broken treaties, oil leaks in aquifers, and children learning endangered words so they can reclaim futures. Today, we're going to flip that postcard over and read it together. And when we're done, I want you to walk away understanding that Hawaiʻi isn’t just a paradise—it’s a place in motion, full of memory and meaning.

[2] KINGDOM TO OCCUPATION: WHAT GOT US HERE  
Let’s get this straight up front: Hawaiʻi was a sovereign nation until 1893. Internationally recognized. Had treaties. Printed its own currency. Hosted diplomatic missions. That all changed when U.S.-backed businessmen overthrew Queen Liliʻuokalani. No treaty of annexation was ever signed. The U.S. just… stayed. That’s the unfinished legal story that underpins everything else you’re going to hear. It's why sovereignty movements today don’t just chant slogans—they point to the literal absence of any formal transfer of power. No treaty, no consent.

[3] TOURISM: THE ENGINE THAT EATS ITS DRIVER  
Now jump to today. Tourism makes up a huge portion of Hawaiʻi’s economy—around a quarter of its GDP. But here's the catch: the very thing that feeds the system is also displacing the people who live in it. The average home on Maui costs over a million dollars. Short-term rentals hollow out neighborhoods. Locals live in cars while visitors sip mai tais on beachfront lanais. A tourist can book the land for a week. A local can’t afford to stay for life. That’s not a culture clash—that’s an economic eviction.

[4] HOUSELESS ≠ HOMELESS  
But this story isn’t just about what’s being lost—it’s also about what’s being rebuilt. In places like Waiʻanae, entire houseless communities are self-organizing with rules, education hubs, security teams. They call themselves houseless, not homeless, because their relationship to ʻāina—land—isn’t severed. Think of these as sovereignty experiments in miniature. They’re not waiting for a vote or a court ruling. They’re living the alternative already.

[5] CULTURE: NOT A SOUVENIR  
In Hawaiʻi, culture isn’t something you wear on a t-shirt. It's a living practice. Schools like Ka Waihona o ka Naʻauao are teaching kids in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi—Hawaiian language—embedding lessons in genealogy, land, and responsibility. Surfing here isn’t just a sport. It’s a political act. It’s a birthright reclaimed. Hula isn’t just for tourists—it’s encoded law. And when you ask a kid where they're from, don’t be surprised if they list their mountain, their stream, their reef, and only then their school. That’s not quaint. That’s curriculum.

[6] LITTLE LEAGUE AND ALOHA AMBASSADORS  
Let’s talk sports. In 2022, Honolulu’s Little League team wiped the floor with the world—13-3 in the championship game, undefeated throughout. But what stood out wasn’t just the score. It was how these 12-year-olds carried themselves. Manager Gerald Oda made sure every kid understood: “You’re not just playing to win. You’re representing Hawaiʻi. You're ambassadors of aloha.” That mindset—“WE > ME”—reflects the deeper logic of community responsibility. You win for your people, not for your stats.

[7] RAINBOW WARRIORS AND RESILIENCE  
Same thing with the University of Hawaiʻi football team. From the “Wonder Teams” of the 1920s to the undefeated season in 2007, the Rainbow Warriors have played through financial droughts, stadium closures, and even world wars. Their legacy is more than wins—it’s proof of endurance. The team’s highs and lows map onto the broader story of Hawaiʻi itself: displaced, underestimated, but never out of the game. Their fight song might as well be the state’s anthem.

[8] SHAKEN FOUNDATIONS – EARTHQUAKES AND ERUPTIONS  
But Hawaiʻi’s identity doesn’t just come from its people. The land speaks too. In 1975, a 7.7 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that hit 47 feet in places. In 2006, the Kīholo Bay quake knocked out power across Oʻahu and cracked open hotel towers on the Big Island. And there’s more: a 1955 submarine eruption deep beneath the ocean. These aren’t background events. They’re reminders that the ground itself moves—like history, like culture, like sovereignty. Nothing here is still.

[9] THE 1978 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION – A TURNING POINT  
In 1978, Hawaiʻi held a state constitutional convention that reshaped its political DNA. It established the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, made Hawaiian an official state language again, and carved out a right to privacy unique in the U.S. legal system. The convention also elevated a generation of local leaders, including the state’s first Native Hawaiian governor, John Waiheʻe. For many, this was the moment when Hawaiʻi stopped asking for permission and started drafting its own future.

[10] SOVEREIGNTY IN INCHES, NOT MILES  
A lot of people think sovereignty means some dramatic declaration of independence. But in Hawaiʻi, it’s happening in inches. A restored fishpond. A language immersion program. A charter school with curriculum rooted in moʻolelo—ancestral stories. A houseless village built without permits but full of purpose. Each one is a brick in a bigger structure. Sovereignty isn’t a destination—it’s a practice.

[11] IDENTITY: GENEALOGY AND KULEANA  
Here, identity isn’t about checking a box. It’s about knowing your kuleana—your responsibility. Being Hawaiian isn’t about DNA percentages. It’s about how you serve the land, your elders, your story. Being local means you move with the rhythm of the islands, not against it. Being a visitor? That’s fine—as long as you understand you’re on borrowed time, borrowed space, and someone else’s history.

[12] ENVIRONMENT – THE LAND REMEMBERS  
When the Navy spilled fuel into Oʻahu’s water supply, it wasn’t just pollution—it was desecration. When wildfires tore through Lāhainā, it wasn’t just property damage—it was cultural erasure. This land has memory. It remembers being a kingdom. It remembers who farmed it, who fought for it, and who ignored it. In Hawaiian worldview, you don’t own land. You care for it. If you’re lucky, it lets you stay.

[13] IF YOU COME TO VISIT…  
…understand this: your trip is not neutral. When you fly in, you increase the load on a system that’s cracking. When you hike a closed trail or ignore a kapu sign, you’re not just breaking a rule—you’re breaking relationship. But it’s not about guilt. It’s about stewardship. Want to be part of Hawaiʻi’s future? Start with reef-safe sunscreen, local-owned businesses, and a willingness to listen before you Instagram.

[14] CLOSING: THE POSTCARD, REWRITTEN  
So let’s go back to that postcard. Now it’s got both sides filled in. The front still shows the beauty—it always will. But the back tells the story of a people still here. Still fighting. Still dancing. Still dreaming. That’s Hawaiʻi. Not a fantasy. Not a souvenir. A place in motion. A place of meaning. A place that remembers. Mahalo.
