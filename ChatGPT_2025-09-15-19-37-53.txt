Observed Trends and Progression Patterns Across Your Chats  

1. EVOLUTION FROM GENERAL TO GRANULAR  

- Early questions (July 2024) are broader and more foundational:  
  • Structuring an infinite-swimming game.  
  • Understanding Unreal Engine features.  
  • General film and game analysis frameworks.  

- Later questions (September 2024 onward) increasingly target very specific sub-processes:  
  • Procedural track generation with exact control-space definitions (9 sections, slowing player movement).  
  • Water texture design using layered optical illusions with specific color and wave properties.  
  • Agent communication models inside local AI environments like AnythingLLM with mutual validation loops.  

- In film analysis, you move from “list and compare James Bond films” to:  
  • Building hybrid antagonist characters.  
  • Outlining story arcs using Dan Harmon’s story circle structure with antagonist-vs-protagonist relationship analysis.  

2. CONSISTENT FOCUS AREAS ACROSS DIFFERENT DOMAINS  

a. STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE MODELS  
- Game dev, AI agent setup, JSON optimization, and financial analysis all eventually connect back to structured frameworks (graphs, hierarchical models, ontological relationships).  

b. AUTONOMOUS OR SEMI-AUTONOMOUS AGENTS  
- From AI teams co-developing Unreal Engine projects (Python + Blueprint) to AnythingLLM agents organizing knowledge — emphasis is on building self-checking systems.  
- Questions move from “how do I use this tool?” to “how do I make this tool configure and validate itself?”  

c. GAME DESIGN — FINE CONTROL  
- Progression from generic “infinite-runner game” structures to:  
  • Exact spatial division systems.  
  • Predictable-yet-unique player experience balancing (Dan Harmon story-circle applied to level pacing).  
  • Texture and material design down to wave shape and foam presence.  

3. MINUTIA PROGRESSION EXAMPLES  

a. GAME DEVELOPMENT  
- Starts: “What is Nanite?”  
- Evolves: “How do I control procedural space in 9 defined areas affecting player movement speed?”  
- Sharp rise in specificity regarding Unreal Engine and Unity function handling, JSON data structure optimization, and agent-integration workflows.  

b. FILM ANALYSIS  
- Starts: “Top Bond films ranked.”  
- Evolves: “What makes these villains terrifying in ways the audience may not consciously recognize?”  
- Leads into building composite villain archetypes tied into modern socio-political context.  

c. AI AGENT SYSTEMS  
- Starts: “How do I set up AnythingLLM?”  
- Evolves: “How do I create a shared message pool with mutual validation for agent tasks using AnythingLLM?”  
- Later tied into Unreal Engine workflows and local CI/CD considerations.  

4. THEMATIC PATTERNS IN YOUR QUESTIONING STYLE  

- A) You prefer building “recipe”-like documents:  
  • Structuring multi-step guides that can be followed by either a human developer or an AI system acting as a developer.  

- B) You continually seek ways to combine creative structure with technical automation:  
  • Story-circle applied to level design pacing.  
  • Combining Python logic with Unreal’s Blueprint for co-development.  
  • Designing textures not just for appearance, but function within game mechanics.  

- C) You often move from “list things” or “compare things” into “synthesize something new based on patterns found”:  
  • Villain synthesis in Bond analysis.  
  • Infinite-runner control schema synthesis combining genre realities with narrative structure.  
  • Hybrid knowledge graph models combining hierarchical and ontological properties.  

5. OVERALL PROGRESSION  
- July 2024: Broad conceptual setup — game design frameworks, tool installation, initial system modeling.  
- August–September 2024: Modularization and optimization — JSON cleaning, graph modeling, structured story/level design.  
- October 2024 onward: Precise control and synthesis —  
  • Procedural generation rulesets.  
  • Agent-based task validation.  
  • Textural/material detail tied directly to player experience.  
  • Building universal antagonist/protagonist patterns with real-world political overlays.  



If you'd like, I can break this into a clean table or bullet-format with one entry per observed trend, or keep layering additional chronological texture and cross-topic correlations.

Designs: optical-illusion water textures, Bond-villain archetype posters, narrative-arc cheat-sheets.

Automation: Redbubble/Printful handle fulfilment; connect to Patreon tiers for bundled perks.

Work-around: zero inventory, zero Mac dependency.

Next Steps

Prioritise high-ROI asset packs (Blueprint track system + water shader) and list them on Fab + Unity first.

Spin up a CrewAI template repo using the official marketplace scaffold; bundle the same logic as an AnythingLLM flow to double-dip marketplaces.

Outline & record an 8-lesson Udemy course while building assets—screen-capture the creation process once and repurpose.

Launch a Patreon tier that drip-feeds monthly “behind the scenes” content plus early access to new agent templates.

Automate upkeep: GitHub Actions to push template/coarse updates; Substack schedule function for newsletters; Redbubble auto-sync for merch.

Execute these five steps and you’ll have at least four distinct passive funnels—asset royalties, template sales, course royalties, and subscription revenue—each requiring minimal monthly maintenance beyond incremental engine or data updates.
