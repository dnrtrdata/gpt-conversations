I have AnythingLLM installed on my local machine. How do I create AI agents on my local machine to organize information, complete tasks, and learn from each other using a common message pool (so that the agents can communicate and therefore check each other's work for each task completed) using AnythingLLM?

To create AI agents on your local machine using AnythingLLM, follow these steps to organize information, complete tasks, and enable agents to learn from each other using a common message pool:

Step 1: Installation

First, ensure that you have AnythingLLM installed. You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install llm


Or with pipx:

bash
Copy code
pipx install llm


Or using Homebrew:

bash
Copy code
brew install llm

Step 2: Setting Up API Keys

If you plan to use external APIs like OpenAI, you need to configure your API keys:

bash
Copy code
llm keys set openai
# Then paste your OpenAI API key

Step 3: Creating and Configuring Agents

Create agents that can communicate and check each other’s work by setting up a common message pool.

Define Agents and Their Skills:
Create different agents with specific skills and configuration.

yaml
Copy code
agents:
  - name: agent1
    skills:
      - skillA
      - skillB
  - name: agent2
    skills:
      - skillC
      - skillD


Setup Common Message Pool:
Use a shared database to store messages that agents can access.

yaml
Copy code
database:
  path: /path/to/shared/database.db


Configure Communication:
Make sure agents are configured to read and write to this common message pool.

yaml
Copy code
communication:
  shared_message_pool: true
  message_pool_path: /path/to/shared/message_pool.db

Step 4: Running Agents

Launch the agents and start their tasks. Agents will read from the common message pool, process tasks, and write results back to the pool.

bash
Copy code
llm start agent1
llm start agent2

Step 5: Ensuring Collaboration

Ensure agents can check each other’s work by setting up a feedback loop. For instance, agent1 can review tasks completed by agent2 and vice versa.

yaml
Copy code
collaboration:
  review_enabled: true
  review_threshold: 0.9  # Confidence threshold for accepting task completion

Example Workflow

Agent 1: Reads a task from the message pool, processes it, and writes the result.

Agent 2: Picks up the result from Agent 1, reviews it, and provides feedback or corrections.

Continuous Learning: Both agents learn from each other's feedback stored in the message pool.

Advanced Configuration

For more complex setups, such as adding new skills, updating agent configurations, or integrating with external services, refer to the full documentation:

Communication Setup

By following these steps, you can set up a collaborative environment where multiple AI agents work together to complete tasks and improve through mutual learning.

To configure AI agents using AnythingLLM, follow the detailed steps outlined below:

Step 1: Define and Configure Agents
1.1. Creating Agents

Define multiple agents with specific skills in a YAML configuration file. Each agent will have its own set of skills and a unique name.

yaml
Copy code
agents:
  - name: agent1
    skills:
      - skillA
      - skillB
  - name: agent2
    skills:
      - skillC
      - skillD

1.2. Shared Message Pool

To allow agents to communicate and check each other’s work, set up a common message pool in the configuration file.

yaml
Copy code
database:
  path: /path/to/shared/database.db


Configure agents to read from and write to this shared message pool.

yaml
Copy code
communication:
  shared_message_pool: true
  message_pool_path: /path/to/shared/message_pool.db

Step 2: Install and Configure Plugins
2.1. Install Plugins

Install necessary plugins to extend the capabilities of AnythingLLM. For example, you can install the llm-gpt4all plugin to run local models.

bash
Copy code
llm install llm-gpt4all


List available plugins to verify installation:

bash
Copy code
llm plugins

2.2. Configure Plugins

Load specific plugins by setting the LLM_LOAD_PLUGINS environment variable.

bash
Copy code
export LLM_LOAD_PLUGINS='llm-gpt4all,llm-cluster'

Step 3: API Key Management
3.1. Storing API Keys

Set and store API keys for different models.

bash
Copy code
llm keys set openai


You will be prompted to enter the API key.

3.2. Using Stored Keys

Keys stored in keys.json are automatically used for API calls. You can specify a key for a specific prompt as follows:

bash
Copy code
llm "Five names for a pet skunk" --key openai

Step 4: Running and Managing Agents
4.1. Starting Agents

Start the agents using the following commands. This will initiate the agents to read from the shared message pool, process tasks, and log their outputs.

bash
Copy code
llm start agent1
llm start agent2

4.2. Logging and Reviewing Outputs

Enable logging to a SQLite database to track agent activities.

bash
Copy code
llm logs on


View the logs using:

bash
Copy code
llm logs list

Step 5: Ensuring Agent Collaboration
5.1. Feedback and Review Mechanism

Enable a feedback loop where agents can review each other's outputs. Configure the review threshold in the configuration file.

yaml
Copy code
collaboration:
  review_enabled: true
  review_threshold: 0.9  # Confidence threshold for accepting task completion

5.2. Continuous Learning

Agents can learn from each other by updating their skills based on feedback stored in the shared message pool.

Example Workflow

Agent 1: Reads a task from the message pool, processes it, and writes the result.

Agent 2: Reviews the result from Agent 1, provides feedback, and possibly corrects it.

Continuous Learning: Both agents learn from each other's feedback stored in the message pool.

Advanced Configuration

For more detailed and advanced configurations, such as integrating external services or updating agent skills dynamically, refer to the AnythingLLM Documentation

By following these steps, you can create a collaborative environment where multiple AI agents work together efficiently to complete tasks and improve through mutual learning .
