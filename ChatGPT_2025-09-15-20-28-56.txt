Give me clear, thorough, complete, and granularly-detailed instructions to write a screenplay in .fountain syntax WHILE staying consistent with WGA industry-standards for creating a feature-length screenplay document. 

Provide your entire response in plain-text (meaning it does not contain any Markdown/markup-language symbols like “##” or “**” or “---“, et cetera) within code-fences.

To write a screenplay in .fountain syntax while adhering to WGA industry standards for feature-length screenplay formatting, follow these detailed instructions:

1. **FILE FORMAT & STRUCTURE**
   - Use a plain-text file (.txt) with .fountain as the extension.
   - The document should follow industry-standard screenplay formatting: 12-point Courier (monospace), 1-inch margins on all sides, and approximately one page per minute of screen time.
   - Aim for a feature-length script (90-120 pages).

2. **TITLE PAGE**
   - The title page is optional in .fountain but should be included in the final formatted script.
   - Fountain does not support explicit title pages, but you can add metadata at the top of your script:
     Title: Your Screenplay Title  
     Credit: Written by  
     Author: Your Name  
     Draft date: Month, Year  
     Contact: Your Email or Representation Info  

3. **SCENE HEADINGS (SLUGLINES)**
   - Write in ALL CAPS.
   - Format: INT. or EXT. + LOCATION + TIME OF DAY  
     Example:  
     INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT  
   - If a scene is a continuation (same location, immediate continuation), use "CONTINUOUS" instead of a time of day.
   - If the scene happens moments later, use "LATER."

4. **ACTION LINES (DESCRIPTION)**
   - Always written in present tense.
   - Keep sentences concise and visually descriptive.
   - Avoid passive voice.
   - Only describe what can be seen or heard.
   - Example:
     The wind howls. A door creaks open slowly. JAMES steps inside, his flashlight flickering.

5. **CHARACTER NAMES**
   - When introducing a character, write their name in ALL CAPS, followed by a brief description.
   - Example:
     JAMES (32, rugged, weary) grips a rusted crowbar.
   - When writing dialogue, place the character’s name in uppercase above the dialogue.

6. **DIALOGUE**
   - Character name in uppercase, centered above the dialogue.
   - Keep dialogue lines concise and natural.
   - Example:
     JAMES  
     This place gives me the creeps.

7. **PARENTHETICALS (Wrylies)**
   - Used sparingly for actor direction.
   - Placed between the character’s name and dialogue.
   - Example:
     JAMES  
     (whispering)  
     I don’t think we’re alone.

8. **TRANSITIONS**
   - Optional in .fountain but should be used sparingly.
   - Write in ALL CAPS, aligned to the right.
   - Example:
     FADE TO BLACK.  

9. **SHOT DIRECTIONS (Optional)**
   - Avoid unless necessary for storytelling.
   - Write in ALL CAPS within action lines.
   - Example:
     CLOSE ON: A single drop of blood hits the floor.

10. **MONTAGE**
    - Start with the word "MONTAGE" in uppercase.
    - List individual beats using dashes.
    - Example:
      MONTAGE - JAMES PREPARES FOR BATTLE  
      - He sharpens a blade.  
      - Loads a revolver.  
      - Pulls on a bulletproof vest.  

11. **INTERCUT (For rapid scene transitions)**
    - Use "INTERCUT" when toggling between two locations.
    - Example:
      INTERCUT – JAMES’ APARTMENT / POLICE STATION  
      - JAMES frantically dials.  
      - The DETECTIVE picks up at his desk.  

12. **PHONE CONVERSATIONS**
    - If intercutting, use "INTERCUT" as above.
    - If only one side is heard, use (V.O.) for voice-over or (O.S.) for off-screen.
    - Example:
      JAMES (into phone)  
      Where are you?  

13. **FLASHBACKS**
    - Use "FLASHBACK" in the scene heading.
    - End with "END FLASHBACK."
    - Example:
      INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)  
      Young JAMES hides under the bed.  
      END FLASHBACK.  

14. **SUPERIMPOSED TEXT (On-screen text)**
    - Use "SUPER:" followed by the text in quotes.
    - Example:
      SUPER: "New York City, 1978"

15. **LYRICS**
    - Write song lyrics in uppercase.
    - Example:
      JAMES  
      (singing)  
      TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS...  

16. **END OF SCRIPT**
    - Conclude with "FADE OUT." on the right margin.
    - Write "THE END" centered on the next line.

By following these rules, you will create a properly formatted screenplay using .fountain syntax while staying within WGA industry standards.

Modify 12. So that it focuses on intercuts; as bullet-points within 12., list and exemplify how intercutting is commonly used.

12. INTERCUTS  
    - Used to rapidly switch between two or more locations/scenes happening simultaneously.  
    - Common uses:  

      - **Phone Conversations:** Cuts between both participants.  
        Example:  
        INTERCUT – JAMES’ APARTMENT / POLICE STATION  
        - JAMES frantically dials.  
        - The DETECTIVE picks up at his desk.  
        JAMES  
        Where are you?  

      - **Parallel Action:** Two or more events unfolding at the same time.  
        Example:  
        INTERCUT – BANK HEIST / POLICE RESPONSE  
        - MASKED ROBBERS shove cash into bags.  
        - A POLICE UNIT speeds toward the bank, sirens blaring.  
        - A TELLER reaches for a silent alarm.  

      - **Emotional Connection:** Contrasts two characters experiencing related but separate events.  
        Example:  
        INTERCUT – MAIA / NOAH  
        - MAIA stares at her phone, typing and deleting a message.  
        - NOAH watches the same screen, waiting for a response.  

      - **Tension Building:** Quick cuts between escalating situations.  
        Example:  
        INTERCUT – BOMB TIMER / HERO SEARCHING  
        - A countdown clock blinks: 00:01:30.  
        - The HERO tears through a desk drawer.  
        - 00:01:15.  
        - He finds the wire cutters—then hesitates.  

      - **Fight Sequences:** Simultaneously showcasing multiple battles.  
        Example:  
        INTERCUT – ROOFTOP / WAREHOUSE  
        - The ASSASSIN dodges a bullet, returns fire.  
        - Inside the warehouse, a KNIFE CLASHES against metal.  

    - "INTERCUT" can be used in the scene heading or within action lines to clarify transitions.
