break the following into a sentence-fragment-per-moment-described in the opening scene in Jaws; keep the fragments to five-words-or-less (per-moment):
""1. Opening Scene (Chrissie’s Death)
The first attack happens entirely without the shark being seen. Spielberg uses the rippling surface of the water to imply movement. As Chrissie swims at night, the serene calm of the water is broken by faint disturbances around her. These subtle ripples suggest the shark’s approach before any direct action.
The attack begins with Chrissie’s abrupt, jerking movements, pulled under momentarily, then rising again, screaming. The lack of a visible predator forces the audience to visualize what is happening below. The water becomes an extension of the shark itself—a medium through which its power and violence are expressed.
Chrissie’s screams, accompanied by splashing and thrashing, amplify the terror. The shark’s presence is represented entirely through her reaction and the way the water violently churns around her as she’s dragged across the surface. This unseen force evokes primal fear by making the ocean itself feel alive and predatory.""

use exact wording from the required text as much as possible while maintaining the fragment restrictions (five-words-OR-LESS... meaning each fragment CAN contain five words, but can contain one words, two words, three words, or four words as well... decide which word-length is most appropriate for each fragment please; they shouldn't all have the same word-count -- the word-counts should vary as much as each respective moment does; just make sure there is only one fragment-per-moment-described).

A teenage girl slips into the moonlit water, unaware of what waits below.  
Tiny waves ripple gently as she swims farther from shore.  
The surface, once peaceful, begins to stir with subtle, unnatural motion.  
Barely noticeable rings in the water suggest something closing in.  
There is no creature in sight, but the threat is already here.  
Without warning, her body jolts violently, seized by an invisible attacker.  
She vanishes beneath the surface for a chilling moment.  
She bursts back up, screaming into the empty night.  
Nothing can be seen, leaving the mind to fill in the horror.  
The water itself feels possessed, a living force channeling malice.  
Her screams grow frantic as splashes erupt all around her.  
Foam and waves thrash as she’s dragged helplessly across the surface.  
Whatever stalks her stays hidden, but its presence is unmistakably monstrous.

The ocean stretches into darkness, lit only by a pale moon hanging over the horizon.  
Gentle tides lap at the shore, shimmering faintly beneath the night sky.  
A vast stillness hovers over the water, disturbed only by the girl’s movement.  
Tiny concentric ripples pulse outward, too soft to alarm but too strange to ignore.  
The water looks calm, but its depth conceals everything.  
A sudden splash breaks the surface, sending echoes across the bay.  
The waves settle for a breath, the surface glassy and unbroken.  
Moonlight glints off her face as it bursts upward in terror.  
The sea reveals nothing—no fin, no shadow, only empty blackness.  
Moonlight scatters across the restless surface, glimmering like something alive.  
The camera pulls wide as her cries echo across the desolate beach.  
The sea boils with chaos, each splash more desperate than the last.  
The camera holds steady, fixed on the roiling water, waiting for a glimpse that never comes.
