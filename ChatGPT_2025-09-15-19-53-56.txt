Copy code
A. OVERALL STRUCTURE
   1. Intro: The song opens with a repeated four‐chord progression – Am, D7, Gmaj9, E7 – played twice. This immediately sets a rich harmonic tone.
   2. Verse 1: The progression continues with Am, D7, then Gmaj7 followed by E. The verse develops by repeating similar patterns with subtle changes (e.g., moving to C, then C/G, Esus4, and back to E), marking a clear sectional boundary without vocal influence.
   3. Chorus: The chorus uses a strong cycle (Am, D7, Gmaj7, E) reinforced with suspensions (Esus4) that resolve into E. This cyclical structure emphasizes the thematic material through harmonic repetition.
   4. Instrumental Break: A passage repeats the progression (Am, D7, Gmaj7, Esus4 and later transitioning to Am, D7, Gmaj7, C and then Esus4, E) to create a reflective instrumental interlude.
   5. Verse 2 & Bridge: Variation occurs in verse two with added chords (including Em7 and transitional ideas like Esus4/F), while the bridge introduces expanded chords – Am7, D7, Gmaj7, Cmaj7 followed by color chords such as Fmaj7, G/A, Dmaj9, and finally Fmaj7, G/A, Dmaj9, Cmaj9 – intensifying the harmonic journey.
   6. Outro: The song concludes by revisiting the theme with a progression that restates Am, followed by a shift to D or D7, then G/Gmaj7, and ultimately settles on Esus4 resolving to E, punctuating the narrative of responsibility and resolution.

B. CHORD PROGRESSION & HARMONIC FUNCTIONS
   1. Tonal Center: Although starting on Am suggests an A minor center, the inclusion of extended dominant chords (D7, E7/Esus4) and major sevenths (Gmaj7, Gmaj9) indicate modal interchange and borrowing from related keys.
   2. Dominants & Extensions: 
      a. D7 (D, F#, A, C) introduces non-diatonic color which propels the progression toward G-based chords.
      b. Gmaj7/Gmaj9 (with added 7th or 9th notes) provides lush, expansive harmony that creates a dreamy atmosphere.
      c. E7/Esus4 (E, G#/sus4 notes, B, D) functions as the dominant in A minor, where the suspended 4th (in Esus4) temporarily delays resolution.
   3. Color Chords & Substitutions: 
      a. The use of C and C/G (with a bass inversion) creates smoother voice-leading transitions.
      b. In the bridge, Fmaj7 and Dmaj9 introduce additional layers of harmonic tension and release, pointing to richer textural shifts.
      c. The appearance of chords like Cmaj7 and Cmaj9 further extends the palette and suggests a fluid movement between diatonic and chromatic colors.

C. NOTE-LEVEL & VOICING DETAILS
   1. Guitar Voicings: 
      a. The tabs detail open, resonant voicings – for example, the Gmaj9 and Gmaj7 are voiced with open strings, contributing to an ambient, spacious quality.
      b. Suspended chords (Esus4) create momentary ambiguity before resolving, enhancing the song’s dynamic flow.
   2. Extended Harmonies: 
      a. The addition of 7th, 9th (and in the bridge, even maj9 variants) in chords contributes extra melodic notes that enrich the texture.
      b. The shifting between chord types (e.g., from Gmaj7 in verses to Gmaj9 in the intro) subtly alters the emotional color of the progression.
   3. Bass Inversions: 
      a. Chords like C/G use an alternative bass note to smooth the transition between harmonic regions.
      b. This careful selection of root motion supports seamless voice leading, making the harmonic shifts feel natural.

D. RHYTHMIC & TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS
   1. Time Signature & Tempo: 
      a. Though one analysis has cited a 3/4 waltz feel, the structure indicated by the guitar tabs (consistent chord changes and measure spacing) aligns more traditionally with 4/4 time.
      b. The steady, measured pace (approximately 96–96.1 BPM) supports a relaxed, reflective ballad feel.
   2. Phrasing and Pauses: 
      a. The arrangement (e.g., “2x” repetition in the intro) and clear section breaks imply built-in pauses for breath and dynamic change.
      b. These rests and natural breaks between phrases are integral to creating the song’s contemplative atmosphere.

E. SYNTHESIS: INSTRUMENTATION AND PRODUCTION
   1. Guitar as a Harmonic Foundation: 
      a. The provided tabs reveal a sophisticated guitar part that underpins the entire arrangement, translating complex theoretical ideas into playable fingerings.
      b. The versatility in chord voicings shows the song’s reliance on delicate strumming, arpeggiation, and dynamic shifts, which contribute to its overall emotional palette.
   2. Integration with Multi-Instrument Production: 
      a. While the production features layered piano, synth, and subtle percussion, the guitar chords offer a window into the song’s harmonic structure.
      b. This interplay between guitar-arranged chords and digital production elements enriches both the timbral and expressive aspects of the track.

F. CONCLUSION
   1. The guitar tabs demonstrate that "Like Him" is built on a multi-layered harmonic framework combining classic minor tonality with non-diatonic dominants and extended chord functions.
   2. The detailed chord voicings and transitions observed in the tabs provide insights into the song’s dynamic structure – from the ambient intro to the texturally rich bridge and soulful outro.
   3. Overall, the arrangement reflects deliberate choices in harmony and rhythm that support the song’s meditative quality and emotional depth, making it a compelling study for both performance and theoretical analysis.

       - The chord tabs provided cover the Intro, Verses, and Chorus, showing voicings with open strings and extended chords (e.g., Gmaj7/Gmaj9, Esus4).
       - These voicings aim to capture the ambient, spacious quality of the track’s harmonic foundation.
   2.2. Guitar Solo Tabs:
       - Two main solo sections are transcribed:
           • Solo 1 (starting at approximately 1:32): Features melodic lines on the high e string with sequences such as “12–15–14–12–…”, followed by descending phrases.
           • Solo 2 (starting around 2:32): Uses a similar melodic approach, reinforcing the song’s thematic motifs.
           • An additional fragment from Solo 1 is noted around 4:14, echoing its core ideas.
       - The tab indicates standard tuning (E A D G B E) and places the solos in the key of G.
   2.3. Solo Characteristics:
       - Despite being at a beginner difficulty level, the solos incorporate expressive phrasing that likely draws on pentatonic or modal scales common in neo-soul/pop ballads.
       - The solos complement the underlying chord progression, adding a layer of improvisational texture that bridges sections and heightens emotional impact.

3. INSTRUMENTATION & PRODUCTION CONTEXT:
   3.1. Instrumentation Integration:
       - Beyond guitar, the overall production includes ambient piano (noted for its spacey, atmospheric tone), layered synths, and subtle percussion or programmed drums.
       - The guitar chords and solos work in tandem with these elements to enhance the song’s dynamic range and reflective mood.
   3.2. Arrangement Dynamics:
       - The interlaced use of chord progressions and solos helps mark transitions between sections (e.g., the Instrumental Break and Bridge show expanded voicings with color chords like Fmaj7, Dmaj9, and Cmaj7/Cmaj9).
       - Natural pauses and phrasing breaks within the measured structure (about 148 measures forming around 37 phrases) allow for expressive breathing and dynamic shifts.

4. CONSOLIDATED CONCLUSION:
   4.1. “Like Him” is a multi-layered song that blends rich harmonic progressions with expressive, accessible guitar solos.
   4.2. The detailed chord tabs (though amateur) illuminate the song’s complex interplay of extended chords and suspensions, while the guitar solo tabs provide note-level insight into its improvisational aspects.
   4.3. Together with ambient production elements from piano, synth, and drums, the guitar parts reinforce the reflective, soul-inflected quality of the track.
   4.4. This consolidated view—merging structural, harmonic, and solo information—offers a deeper understanding of the instrumental architecture, independent of the vocal content.

i. GENERAL OVERVIEW:
   a. The OCR text begins with the standard tuning labels (E, B, G, D, A, E) confirming it is for a six-string guitar.
   b. Bracketed labels such as [A], [B], [C], [D], [E], [F], [G] appear to denote distinct sections or segments of the song’s tab.
   c. A sequence of numbers (e.g., 10, 12, 7, 8, 9, etc.) interspersed with occasional letters and symbols suggests fret positions and possibly timing or measure indicators.

ii. SECTIONAL DIVISIONS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS:
   a. The label [A] is followed by sequences like "j = 52 3 4 5 6," which could indicate either bar numbers, measure counts, or pattern repetitions that define the first segment (possibly the intro or main chord pattern).
   b. Subsequent labels [B] and [C] onward indicate shifts between sections. Each bracket likely marks a change in the musical idea—such as moving from chordal backing parts to lead guitar or solo sections.
   c. The appearance of [D], [E], [F], and [G] later in the text suggests additional sections like the bridge, instrumental breaks, or the concluding parts of the song.

iii. FRET PATTERN AND NUMERIC DETAILS:
   a. Repeated numeric patterns such as “12-10-12” and sequences with numbers like “7, 8, 10, 12” are common in the provided amateur chord/solo tabs; they match what one would expect from melodic and solo passages.
   b. There are apparent OCR artifacts (e.g., “I_1 I I I I”) that may have been misread strumming or picking indicators. These errors make it difficult to ascertain precise rhythmic figures.
   c. Some lines list multiple numbers in a row without clear separations. This likely represents either rapid note sequences or arpeggiated figures used in the guitar solo portions.

iv. RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS TAB ANALYSES:
   a. The information from this Songsterr OCR extraction seems to reaffirm the structure already noted from earlier tabs—segmenting the song into clearly defined chord and solo sections.
   b. The bracket labels ([A] through [G]) align with previous interpretations that the track is divided into parts such as the intro, verses, chorus, bridge, and solos.
   c. Despite OCR irregularities, the fret numbers and repetitive motifs are consistent with other transcriptions, confirming patterns like the recurring “12-10” figures in the solos.

v. OVERALL CONCLUSION:
   a. Although the OCR extraction from Songsterr is a rough and unrefined text version—with some artifacts and ambiguities—it still reveals that “Like Him” is structured into multiple clear sections.
   b. It contains both chordal rhythm parts and lead passages; the numeric sequences suggest specific fret positions used in recurring motifs and solo lines.
   c. While a cleaner, more carefully transcribed version would be preferable for performance, the current extraction reinforces the song’s multi-part structure and highlights the central note patterns, confirming the presence of both chordal and solo elements typical of the track.

1. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW:
   a. The song is divided into clear segments: Verse 1, Chorus, an Instrumental Interlude, Verse 2, another Chorus, a Bridge, and a Final Section.
   b. The chord progression in the verses follows a pattern of Am, D7, Gmaj7, and E, with slight variations (e.g., additional Am and F in later parts).
   c. The Chorus reinforces the same progression—Am, D7, Gmaj7, E (or E7)—with repeated lines to emphasize the song’s thematic development, while the Bridge introduces extra colors like Fm9 and Cm7.

2. CHORD FUNCTION AND HARMONIC CONTENT:
   a. The primary tonal center is suggested by the use of Am, though the progression borrows from other keys through dominant chords (D7 and E/E7) and major extensions (Gmaj7).
   b. D7 serves as a dominant pivot, shifting the listener from the minor feel of Am to the lush, open sound of Gmaj7.
   c. E and its variations (e.g., Esus4, E7) create tension and eventual resolution, while the use of Fm9 and Cm7 in the Bridge adds modal color and depth.

3. RHYTHMIC AND TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS:
   a. Despite some earlier reports of a 3/4 feel, the chord patterns from E-Chords indicate a 4/4 structure with clearly defined measures.
   b. The steady rhythm—approximately 96–96.1 BPM—combined with well-marked phrase lengths (seen from measure counts and repeated figures) supports a relaxed yet deliberate pacing throughout the song.

4. GUITAR ARRANGEMENT AND SOLO ELEMENTS:
   a. The core chord parts are captured in the provided E-Chords transcription, which mirrors earlier tabs but with slight modifications (e.g., added Am repetitions or F/Fm9 in the Bridge).
   b. The guitar solos—detailed in separate solo tabs (Solo 1 around 1:32, Solo 2 around 2:32, and an additional fragment at 4:14)—feature repeating motifs (notably sequences like “12–10–12”) that are accessible for beginners while clearly accentuating the song’s melodic themes.
   c. Although some solo transcriptions (from Songsterr OCR) are rough, they confirm the use of recurring note patterns that complement the underlying chord progression.

5. INTEGRATED INSTRUMENTATION AND PRODUCTION NOTES:
   a. Beyond the guitar, the track employs ambient piano, layered synths, and programmed percussion to create a reflective, neo-soul atmosphere.
   b. The interplay between the steady chordal backdrop and the expressive, melodic guitar solos helps define the transitions between song sections and accentuates the overall dynamic range.
   c. Extended chord voicings (like Gmaj7, Gmaj9, and the transitional use of suspended chords) further enrich the harmonic texture, adding layers of emotional complexity.

6. CONSOLIDATED INSIGHTS:
   a. “Like Him” is built on a multifaceted arrangement where a recurring chord pattern (Am – D7 – Gmaj7 – E/E7) is used as a foundation throughout various sections, with subtle modifications to highlight transitions.
   b. The accessible yet expressive guitar solos, featuring recognizable note sequences, enhance the track without overshadowing the core harmonic structure.
   c. In sum, the combined data from E-Chords, Songsterr OCR extractions, and previous analyses confirm a sophisticated yet approachable instrumental framework that supports the song’s reflective mood and layered production.

Try to find out for sure what the time signature is from reputable sources. That songsterr tab indicated that it starts in 6/8 and changes shortly after. I can't know for sure, but hearing the song indicated 3/4 or 6/8... but I need that verified. If you find out more on our other sections, include that too.

I. TIME SIGNATURE FINDINGS:
   A. Multiple reputable sources converge on a 3/4 time signature for "Like Him":
      1. A reputable online tool (songbpm.com) lists the track with a time signature described as “3 beats per bar,” suggesting a 3/4 feel.
      2. An analysis from a music sheet/piano tutorial source confirms the waltz feel characteristic of 3/4 timing.
      3. However, a TikTok transcription suggests that the time signature is 6/8, indicating that some listeners perceive it as having a 6/8 feel due to the division of beats.
   B. Community consensus on Reddit indicates that the track is in 4/4 with each beat subdivided (effectively yielding a 12/8 feel in parts) or interpreted as 3/4 – the common descriptions range between 3/4 and 6/8.
   C. Clarification:
      1. The toolstud.io page from Spotify data reports a time signature described by its phrasing as “3 beats per bar.”
      2. Some listeners and practitioners report that certain sections (especially a sped-up passage) might feel like they temporarily shift to 3/4 or 6/8.
   D. Conclusion:
      - The primary time signature for "Like Him" is most consistently reported as 3/4.
      - Nonetheless, rhythmic subdivisions (such as duple triplet divisions) create a feel that may be interpreted as 6/8 or even a 12/8 swing in parts.
   
II. OTHER MUSICAL ASPECTS:
   A. Tempo and Key:
      1. The song has a tempo of approximately 96 BPM.
      2. It is written in a minor key, with evidence from some sources pointing to E Minor and others analyzing chord progressions around Am.
   B. Chord Structure and Arrangement:
      1. The chord progression is built around recurring patterns (Am, D7, Gmaj7, E/E7) which underpin both the verses and choruses.
      2. Extended chord tones (maj7, maj9) and suspensions contribute to the song's atmospheric, reflective quality.
      3. Transitions between sections—verse, chorus, instrumental breaks, and bridge—are achieved via subtle harmonic variations, as evidenced by differences in chords (e.g., inclusion of C, Fm9, and Cm7 in the bridge).
   C. Instrumentation:
      1. Alongside piano-driven chords, the song incorporates layered synths, guitar parts, and rhythmic percussion.
      2. Guitar solo transcriptions (from Songsterr and other tabs) reveal repetitive motifs that accentuate the song’s melodic themes.
      3. Production notes indicate an overall balance between ambient instrumentation and focused lead sections, enhancing its neo-soul ballad feel.

III. OVERALL SYNTHESIS:
   - Although subjective interpretations exist (3/4 vs. 6/8), the most reliable sources—such as SongBPM and instructional tutorials—point to a primary time signature of 3/4.
   - The perception of a 6/8 feel in some sections likely arises from the subdivision of the 3/4 beats into two groups of three (effectively 6/8), or a temporary rhythmic modulation.
   - The detailed chord and solo transcriptions further reinforce the song’s complex rhythmic and harmonic identity, contributing to its emotive and reflective character.

Add the following data and context specifically to the song "Like Him":
When I first listened to Chromakopia, I had no clear idea where Tyler would take me. From the earliest tracks, it felt like stepping into his open journal, encountering unfiltered scraps of thought and emotion. This haphazard tapestry drew me in—despite its chaotic structure, Chromakopia retains a distinct magnetism. The single that kept me returning was “Like Him,” featuring Lola Young. At first, it was the haunted piano motif and layered production that hooked me; but as I listened more carefully, it became impossible to ignore the deeply personal story woven into its lyrics.

An Exploration of Identity and Legacy
“Like Him” dives headfirst into the complexities of identity, abandonment, and reconciliation. Tyler wrestles with how his physical and emotional traits mirror a father he scarcely knows. This struggle resonates in the repeated question, “Do I look like him? Like him, like him,” which highlights his fixation on understanding how much of his father’s legacy is manifest in his own being. It’s one thing to inherit someone’s facial expressions or long arms—hearing his mother’s voice confirm these resemblances delivers a haunting sense of genetic inevitability. Yet the true power lies in how that inheritance intersects with absence, forming a painful juxtaposition: every time Tyler sees himself, he’s reminded of a man who wasn’t there.

Chasing a Ghost: The Absence of a Father
In the refrain, “Mama, I’m chasin’ a ghost,” Tyler captures the heartbreak of longing for something intangible. His father is more a spectral presence than a tangible figure—someone whose greatest imprint is his very absence. Early on, Tyler’s mother, Bonita Smith, sets a deeply personal tone by recounting how Tyler’s gestures, posture, and even feet echo those of his father. But as the outro’s confession reveals—“It was my fault, not yours, not his... he’s a good guy”—we discover that Tyler’s mother made choices that kept his father away. The track thus changes direction, shifting from anger and confusion toward an underlying acceptance: the father Tyler resented might have wanted to be a dad all along. This revelation isn’t just a plot twist; it’s an emotional pivot that compels both Tyler and listeners to reconsider everything leading up to that point.

Love in the Absence of Perfection
Despite the vacuum left by his father, Tyler acknowledges how his mother showered him with care: “You gave me love and affection, attention, protection.” Gratitude intersects with a deep-seated ache for what never was. One line, “How could I ever miss somethin’ that I’d never had?” captures the paradox of yearning for something intangible. It resonates with anyone grappling with a hole in their family life—how do you grieve what you never possessed? Yet there’s no resentment toward his mother, even as he uncovers more about her role in his father’s absence. Instead, there’s an undercurrent of compassion for the complexity of her situation, an understanding that life often unfolds in tangled ways.

Musicality and Atmosphere
Tyler’s approach to the production underscores the depth of these themes. The opening minute’s minimalist piano, paired with a subdued vocal, conveys a near-mournful loneliness. Then come the distorted guitars and heavier percussion, intensifying the sense of unraveling. It’s as though each added layer of sound amplifies Tyler’s conflicting emotions—his thirst for answers, his heartbreak, and his defiance of this paternal void. Lola Young’s vocals function like an ethereal echo, reflecting Tyler’s inner questions back to him. By the time the outro arrives, we’ve traversed a crescendo of turmoil that culminates in a stark spoken-word confession. It’s this concluding section—where Tyler’s mother takes ownership—that completely reframes the track.

A Turn Toward Forgiveness and Understanding
When Tyler’s mother says, “Don’t hold it against him, because it was my fault,” the entire narrative is turned upside down. Suddenly, “Like Him” isn’t just about an absent father. It’s about reconciling misguided blame and the years of anger that stemmed from a half-known story. The revelation prompts a wave of empathy for every party involved, including Tyler himself, who has spent so long haunted by someone he never truly got to know. As he tries to rectify these perspectives, the track becomes an anthem for self-discovery, urging a fundamental question: How do we integrate both the known and unknown pieces of our identity into something whole?

Conclusion: Searching for Peace in the Past
Ultimately, “Like Him” stands as a pivotal moment on Chromakopia. It’s an intensely personal odyssey—melancholic, raw, and simultaneously cathartic. Tyler sets out to unearth painful truths about his father, but ends up unearthing new truths about himself, his mother, and the nature of forgiveness. The simplest refrain—“Do I look like him?”—echoes beyond its literal meaning, morphing into a deeper exploration of belonging, inheritance, and acceptance.

The song’s resonance lies in how universal that search can feel. We all grapple with parts of our identity shaped by people who may or may not have been there for us, or by situations beyond our control. Yet Tyler’s journey, underscored by such a confessional outro, reminds us that unearthing buried truths can lead to more empathy—for others and for ourselves. In the end, “Like Him” isn’t solely about a father’s absence; it’s an intimate meditation on the ties that bind us, even when they’re frayed, and the path toward understanding the ghosts we can’t help but chase.

“Like Him” by Tyler, The Creator featuring Lola Young stands as a deeply introspective centerpiece of the 2024 album Chromakopia. Clocking in at 4 minutes and 38 seconds, the track is structurally fluid but emotionally exacting, built around a tempo of approximately 96 BPM and, as confirmed by multiple reputable sources, largely composed in a 3/4 time signature. Though some listeners interpret portions of the track as shifting into a 6/8 feel due to the rhythmic subdivisions, the dominant meter retains the swing and triplet emphasis characteristic of a waltz. The song’s tonal center hovers between A minor and E minor, with chord progressions gravitating toward the former while some harmonic analytics favor the latter, reflecting the song’s duality of tonal ambiguity and emotional clarity.

The structure of “Like Him” unfolds in discrete yet organically evolving sections. An ambient piano motif introduces the song with a haunting simplicity, setting a melancholic tone that lingers throughout. Verse 1 and the Chorus alternate between the chords Am, D7, Gmaj7, and E, with occasional substitutions such as Gmaj9 or Esus4 to color the transitions. These progressions are not merely decorative; they contour the emotional trajectory, giving musical form to the tension Tyler navigates in the lyrics. A brief instrumental interlude reasserts the core harmonic patterns before Verse 2 re-engages them, subtly varied for narrative development. The Bridge emerges as a harmonic rupture, introducing new textures like Fm9, Cm7, and Dmaj9, marking an emotional and musical escalation. The final section strips back much of the production, delivering a spoken-word confession that reframes all that came before.

Tyler’s harmonic choices throughout the track are deliberate and refined. “Like Him” ranks exceptionally high in several harmonic complexity metrics: its chord complexity is scored at 93, chord progression novelty at 90, and melodic complexity at 61. These numbers translate into the track’s tangible sonic richness—the extended chord voicings, tension-laden dominants, and melodic interplay all serve a purpose. They communicate unease, longing, and finally, release. Extended chords like Gmaj7, Gmaj9, and suspended resolutions via E7 and Esus4 inject emotional density. The harmonic decisions reflect internal struggle and reconciliation, amplifying the lyrical exploration with nuanced musical language.

Instrumentation plays a key role in reinforcing this mood. A sparse, ambient piano sound—possibly from a preset such as Omnisphere’s Ambient Space Piano—forms the backbone of the arrangement. Synth layers enter gradually, adding width and depth to the emotional space. Guitar contributes both rhythmically and melodically: chordal underpinnings appear throughout, but so do brief solos—particularly at around 1:32, 2:32, and a reprise at 4:14. These solos, while technically accessible for beginner guitarists, recur with motifs like 12–10–15 on the high strings, echoing the theme of haunted repetition. Percussive elements remain understated but deliberate, supporting rather than distracting from the song’s introspective tone. Vocally, Tyler adopts a subdued, almost restrained delivery, countered by Lola Young’s ethereal layering that echoes his questions back to him. The final spoken confession from Tyler’s mother provides a stark contrast, removing all melody to leave behind only emotional weight.

Thematically, “Like Him” is a meditation on identity, absence, and reconciliation. The recurring line “Do I look like him?” becomes less a question and more an incantation—a mantra that blurs the line between self-discovery and inherited pain. Tyler uses this refrain to wrestle with the physical, emotional, and spiritual traces of a father he never really knew. At the core of the song is a paradox: how can someone leave a mark so profound simply by being absent? The lyrics traverse this terrain with brutal clarity, acknowledging the pain of inheriting gestures, features, and tendencies from someone whose role was defined by not being there.

As the song unfolds, its emotional terrain deepens. The phrase “Mama, I’m chasin’ a ghost” encapsulates the longing for what was never truly present. This yearning gains complexity in the outro, when Tyler’s mother confesses that it was her decisions—not the father’s lack of love—that led to his absence. With that revelation, the entire emotional architecture of the song shifts. What began as a lament becomes a reckoning, and ultimately a form of forgiveness. Tyler does not merely seek closure from his father, but also from the myth he built around him, from his own assumptions, and from the quiet resentments harbored through youth. The final pivot is not a resolution in the traditional sense, but an emotional reorganization—a new narrative where blame dissolves into empathy.

The brilliance of “Like Him” lies in its synthesis of lyrical vulnerability and musical restraint. Each instrumental layer mirrors a psychological layer being stripped away. The gradual build—from sparse piano to layered textures to confessional climax—follows an emotional arc more akin to narrative cinema than conventional songwriting. The song’s resonance is not limited to Tyler’s personal story; it speaks to the universal struggle to integrate inherited identity with lived experience. We all chase ghosts—people who shaped us without being present, decisions made before we understood their context. In grappling with these ghosts, “Like Him” becomes not just an exploration of paternal absence, but a study in how understanding, even when it arrives late, can be transformative.

“Like Him” ultimately defines the soul of Chromakopia. Amid an album that feels like rummaging through scattered thoughts and personal fragments, this track provides gravity. It fuses musical complexity with emotional transparency and stands as one of Tyler’s most revealing works. It’s not just a song about a father—it’s a song about what it means to be a son, a product of circumstance, and an architect of new meaning from inherited pain. It is a journal entry with a backbeat, a question wrapped in reverb, and a reckoning whispered beneath a major seventh chord.

Tyler stood alone in the silence of his studio, fingers poised over a piano that didn’t feel like his, yet somehow knew exactly what he needed. One by one, the notes fell into place—measured, mournful, delicate. The tempo was slow, a heartbeat at 96 BPM, and the rhythm swayed in triple time, 3/4, like a waltz danced by a ghost. He didn’t question where the pattern came from. He just let it guide him. A minor chord—Am—carried the weight of every memory he didn’t have. D7 added tension, unresolved, as though something was always about to arrive but never did. Gmaj7 came next, full and wistful, and then E—sometimes suspended, sometimes extended—like a door left open just long enough to imagine what was behind it. He looped the chords again. And again. Until they weren’t chords anymore. They were memories he never owned.

“Do I look like him?” Tyler asked the question with no audience. The studio light buzzed overhead. Lola’s voice layered itself behind his like an echo inside his skull. That line wasn’t just a lyric—it was the pulse of the entire song. A mantra. A haunting. His mother had told him once that he had his father’s posture. That his walk, his jaw, even his silence resembled the man he’d never really met. The words stayed with him. Every time he passed a mirror, it wasn’t just his own face he saw—it was someone else's absence staring back. So he sang the question, and then he sang it again. And then he added chords beneath it, turning that unanswerable ache into structure. Verse by verse, the track emerged not as a song but as a confrontation—with inheritance, with resemblance, with ghost stories passed down in posture and pitch.

In the middle of the song, Tyler let the guitar speak. Simple phrases danced across the high strings: 12, 10, 15—fragments of melody, hesitant but insistent. The solos were sparse, beginner-level in technique, but weighted with emotional fluency. He didn’t need technical flash. He needed something that trembled like truth. Each note felt like a syllable he couldn’t say. These brief instrumental breaks weren’t for flourish; they were spaces to breathe, to wonder, to ache between the verses.

But the verses never let go. They spoke of a mother’s love—attention, protection, the steady kind of devotion that fills in cracks left by another’s absence. Still, it wasn’t enough to erase the questions. “How could I miss something I never had?” he asked aloud in the booth, not knowing if he meant it rhetorically or not. The chorus repeated like a ritual: “Mama, I’m chasin’ a ghost.” The line didn’t just describe longing. It was longing. Not for a man, really, but for the shape that man left in Tyler’s life—a silhouette, a negative space.

The bridge arrived like a storm system, shifting the song’s harmonic weather. Fm9. Cm7. Dmaj9. New textures that felt like emotional breakthroughs, not just chords. Here, Tyler allowed vulnerability to tip into chaos. Distorted guitars entered. Percussion thickened. The space grew darker, louder. Each added layer felt like emotion rising through the throat, threatening to spill. Lola’s voice, ethereal and distant, no longer felt like background—it became the voice inside his head, reflecting his questions back at him, less like a duet and more like a mirror.

And then, the noise cleared.

Just one voice remained—his mother’s.

The outro was not a climax. It was a reckoning. Her words broke the spine of the narrative: “It was my fault… don’t hold it against him.” Suddenly, the foundation of the song cracked open. The absence Tyler had built his grief around wasn’t simple. It wasn’t abandonment, not exactly. It was miscommunication, youth, pain, and decisions made behind closed doors. In those final moments, the song transformed—not into forgiveness exactly, but into something adjacent: understanding. The ghost wasn’t banished. But it was seen. Heard. Even mourned properly.

When the song ended, Tyler didn’t move for a long time. He had built something out of memory and myth, layered chords over questions, solos over silence. “Like Him” wasn’t just a track on Chromakopia. It was a room he walked into with no map and came out of holding pieces of himself he hadn’t known were missing. It had begun as a song about a father. But in the end, it became a song about Tyler. About what it means to inherit pain you didn’t choose, to resemble someone you barely remember, and to decide—through music, through storytelling, through sound—that the past doesn’t have to stay broken to remain true.

Tyler stood in the studio, the kind of stillness around him that felt earned. The piano, untouched for hours, waited. The keys seemed distant, as though part of someone else’s instrument. But as he sat, his fingers fell into a pattern they already knew. Slow. Deliberate. 96 beats per minute, swaying in three. Not four. Not straight. Like memory. Like breath caught in the chest. Like forgiveness taking its time.

The chords spilled out—Am, D7, Gmaj7, E—looping quietly beneath the silence, as if they’d been there all along. Each shape was a sentence in a language Tyler hadn’t spoken out loud before. A minor. The key of doubt. The key of longing. D7, a push into the past. Gmaj7 opened like a sigh. E, suspended, never fully arriving. He didn’t plan it. The chords were honest. That’s all they had to be.

Lola's voice wasn’t there yet. Not vocally. But her energy floated in the back of his head. Tyler imagined her listening. Not critiquing. Just witnessing. That was all he ever really wanted—for someone to see him ask the question: “Do I look like him?” The words fell out in rhythm, like footsteps echoing through a hallway he’d never walked. He’d grown up with stories told in fragments. A raised eyebrow. A mother’s offhand comment about his jawline. A sigh when he laughed just like the man she wouldn’t name.

That refrain. “Like him.” It wasn’t a lyric. It was an inheritance. Not of wealth. Not of trauma, even. Of absence. Tyler had inherited absence, like some kids inherited freckles or stubbornness. And the chords under that question carried it—carried him. Carried all the years he spent building a phantom father from puzzle pieces no one gave him all at once.

In the verses, he wrote what he knew: his mother’s love. It was there. Tangible. Protective. Protective even to a fault. He didn’t want to believe she’d kept the truth from him out of malice. But a part of him—the boy inside—had spent years angry that he’d been left behind. That someone had chosen not to know him. He had imagined his father as indifferent. Cold. Distant. Until he started writing this song. Until he started listening to his mother’s voice in his head—not the mother who disciplined, but the one who wept when no one watched.

The guitar solo came next, simple and soft. High notes tracing the shape of a memory that wasn’t his. He didn’t need technical mastery. He needed honesty. Notes that wavered, hesitated, doubled back on themselves. Notes that mourned a conversation that never happened. Each phrase—a gesture of understanding.

Then came the bridge. Not just musically. Emotionally. Tyler shifted the chord structure deliberately—Fm9, Cm7, Dmaj9. New harmonic textures for new truths. He imagined the moment—his mother, young, afraid, doing what she thought was right. Not perfect. But right. He hadn’t asked what it cost her to make the choice. He hadn’t asked what love looked like from her side. Maybe he hadn’t wanted to know. Maybe it was easier to be hurt than to see her as someone flawed and human.

And then the final voice entered—not his, not Lola’s. His mother’s. Not imagined. Real. Recorded late at night, in the same booth, after a long conversation neither of them had expected to have. Her voice didn’t waver. It confessed. “It was my fault, not yours, not his.” Tyler didn’t know what to feel the first time he heard the playback. The piano behind her barely whispered. The air in the studio felt like it had stopped moving. She wasn’t making excuses. She wasn’t asking for forgiveness. She was offering clarity. And he hadn’t known how badly he needed it.

That moment—those words—changed the song. Changed him.

He saw it all differently now. His father, no longer a villain in shadow, but a man who had maybe tried. Who had loved imperfectly, from a distance. His mother, not a gatekeeper, but a mother who tried to be enough for both roles. And himself—not a victim of their choices, but a product of their complexity. A son. Not of ghosts. Of people.

When the final chord played, Tyler stayed still again. Not paralyzed. Grounded. He had chased a ghost and found something far more solid. The song didn’t give him a happy ending. It gave him something better: peace.

He didn’t resent his mother anymore.

He didn’t hate the silence that used to hang between questions.

He just breathed.

He let the last note fade.

And for the first time in a long time, he didn’t need to ask if he looked like him. He was his own man now. That was enough.

Tyler stood in the studio, the kind of stillness around him that felt earned. The quiet wasn’t just the absence of noise—it was the absence of judgment, of pressure, of pretending he was somewhere else. The piano, untouched for hours, waited in a kind of mutual silence, like it understood. When his fingers finally touched the keys, they didn’t press—they asked. Slow, deliberate notes spilled out, waltzing gently in 3/4 time. It wasn’t a time signature so much as a body language, a swaying uncertainty that fit the theme of identity’s imbalance. These weren’t just sounds. They were echoes of questions he hadn’t yet formed. The chords—Am, D7, Gmaj7, E—were mood incarnate: introspective, unresolved, open-ended. Each one framed a stage in his emotional arc, an emotional palette laid bare. Am grounded him in absence. D7 lingered like tension between generations. Gmaj7 offered warmth that wasn’t his to claim. And E hung at the end of each phrase like a door that almost opened.

He sang softly into the empty room, “Do I look like him?” It wasn’t performance. It was ritual. A refrain for a question that had no answer, or at least none that had ever been given to him directly. The lights above hummed, indifferent to the weight of the inquiry. Lola Young’s voice layered into the track like wind blowing through a cracked window—not confrontation, but reflection. Their voices never battled. They mirrored. Tyler’s mother had once told him that he had his father’s feet. His shoulders. His laugh. She had said it so casually, unaware she was branding him with someone else's legacy. The song’s theme—the tension between inheritance and identity—wrapped around every chord like ivy on a gravestone. Tyler wasn’t just playing music. He was playing fragments of himself he didn’t know how to name.

When he stepped away from the microphone to pick up the guitar, he didn’t reach for bravado. He reached for clarity. The solos he played were hesitant—deliberate pauses between emotional thoughts. On the high strings, the sequence of 12, 10, 15, 14 wasn’t a melody; it was a hesitation. Like asking a question, then wondering if you had the right to ask it at all. These notes carried the protagonist’s internal monologue—small, melodic windows into an inner life defined by contradiction. The simplicity of the solo underscored the track’s mood: not one of climax, but of low, sustained ache. It aligned with Tyler’s place in the story—a son tracing an outline of a father who had never filled it in.

The verses returned with purpose, like breathing after a held note. They were grounded in the maternal—a source of love that had always been there, even when imperfect. Tyler sang about his mother’s affection not with bitterness, but with reverence. Still, that reverence couldn’t erase the shadow his father left. “How could I miss something I never had?” he asked again, this time with the weight of recognition. It wasn’t just longing. It was legacy rewritten as a wound. Thematically, this was the moment of tension between gratitude and grief. His mother had tried to be everything. That didn’t mean the missing piece didn’t matter. Tyler’s pain didn’t contradict her love—it coexisted with it, as many truths do. The song’s structure mirrored that duality, returning to the familiar chord cycle even as the lyrics began to dig deeper into emotional soil.

Then came the bridge—a rupture in both sound and soul. The harmonic shift to Fm9, Cm7, and Dmaj9 wasn’t arbitrary. These chords shimmered with emotional dissonance, introducing new harmonic textures just as Tyler introduced new emotional truths. The distorted guitars and heavier percussion didn’t just escalate the song musically—they externalized his internal volatility. He was no longer just reflecting. He was reckoning. The mood intensified, building a thematic parallel between musical chaos and the psychological unraveling that comes when a child begins to see his parents as flawed. Lola’s voice, once ambient, now echoed like conscience—soft, echoic, asking not for clarity but for emotional stamina. Could he hold all of this complexity at once? Could the song?

And then—silence. Or something like it.

His mother’s voice emerged, stripped of melody, stripped of metaphor. A confession. “It was my fault… don’t hold it against him.” The piano barely moved beneath her, almost unwilling to interrupt. The mood shifted instantly—from conflict to surrender. From myth to truth. Thematically, this was the protagonist’s beat of revelation, where perspective changed everything. The villain he had shaped in the shadows of his childhood turned out to be a man exiled by circumstance, not cruelty. The mother he had deified made a choice that cost them both, and in that confession, she reclaimed her humanity. The song’s story pivoted from one of ghost-chasing to one of generational forgiveness. Not erasure. Understanding.

When the track ended, Tyler didn’t immediately move. Stillness had returned, but it was a different stillness now—not blank, but full. He had taken all those fragmented emotions—grief, love, confusion, anger—and given them structure. Not to resolve them, but to respect them. The catharsis wasn’t in the melody. It was in the mood he could now live with. He no longer needed to chase the ghost. He no longer needed his father to answer the question. He could be his own answer.

For the first time in his life, Tyler looked in the mirror and didn’t flinch at the resemblance. Didn’t mourn the man he hadn’t known. Didn’t punish his mother for a truth she had once hidden. He stood there, still swaying in triple time, and let the echo of the final chord settle inside him like a heartbeat—steady, uncertain, and finally, okay.
