Removing the non-relevant lists and focusing only on those that reflect modern daily life, here is the refined set of lists from your original selection.

From this refined set, I’ve now identified those that are most relevant to Hawaiian students, especially at the high school level, but with applicability across all ages.

MOST RELEVANT TO MODERN HAWAIIAN STUDENTS (ALL ISLANDS)

List of high schools in Hawaii
Directly maps where students go to school. Core to student experience, identity, and peer network.

List of school districts in Hawaii
Determines school policies, access to resources, and geographic boundaries affecting where students attend.
