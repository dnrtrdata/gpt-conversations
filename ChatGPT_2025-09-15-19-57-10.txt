I'm going to provide a list of story cliches that I'll then need you to compare overly-specified list of cliches from specific properties. You will compare each specific-property-cliche-list to the original list and either decide the specific cliches are close enough to the original, approved list of cliches -- if they are, you'll change them to the approved cliche; or you'll decide the specific-cliches are not close enough to the original cliches and you'll remove them from the specific list.

The goal is to apply the same list of cliches to a diverse range of story-properties I love to see which cliches I'm comfortable with -- so we need a shared list to compare cliches across these story-properties with the ability to make apples-to-apples comparisons.

Sinners (Ryan Coogler, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke as the disillusioned protector, Annie as the grounded healer, Sammie as the conflicted prodigy.
    - These roles start archetypal but gain layered motives, contradictions, and emotional depth.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke’s unresolved grief, Mary’s guilt over passing, Stack’s moral fracture.
    - Each internal struggle is meaningfully tied to the story’s theme of community sacrifice and legacy.


  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie and Pearline’s tender courtship; Stack and Mary’s mournful rekindling.
    - These arcs evolve from shared pain, trust, and temptation rather than genre-convenient chemistry.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Annie’s knowledge of folk defense; Delta Slim’s blues mysticism.
    - Their support emerges from existing roles and accumulated wisdom, not plot convenience.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie’s transcendent performance unwittingly draws spirits and Remmick’s attention.
    - The threat rises organically from character-driven actions rooted in legacy and desire.

  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke’s death followed by Sammie’s walk into daylight.
    - The tonal descent into loss is resolved by quiet survival, not cinematic excess.


  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke cradling Annie before euthanizing her.
    - A moment of internal collapse anchors the moral cost of the fight.


  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Grace’s invitation breaks the safety threshold; Slim dies at the keys.
    - This beat is visualized as both physical defeat and emotional devastation.

Thunderbolts* (Jake Schreier, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Yelena as the disillusioned assassin, Bob as the traumatized superhuman, Walker as the disgraced patriot.
    - These roles start archetypal but gain layered motives, contradictions, and emotional depth.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Bob's internal struggle with the Void, Yelena's confrontation with her past as a Black Widow.
    - Each internal struggle is meaningfully tied to the story’s theme of identity and control.


  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Subtle dynamics, such as the camaraderie between team members, develop organically.
    - These arcs evolve from shared pain, trust, and mutual understanding rather than genre-convenient chemistry.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Alexei Shostakov (Red Guardian) provides guidance and support, aiding the team's cohesion and mission success.
    - Their support emerges from existing roles and accumulated wisdom, not plot convenience.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Valentina's manipulation and the activation of Bob's powers inadvertently unleash the Void.
    - The threat rises organically from character-driven actions rooted in legacy and desire.


  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moments of calm, such as the team's brief respite before confronting the Void, heighten the tension and underscore impending danger.
    - Stillness and ambient tension precede every major eruption of violence or possession.


  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Following the Void's defeat, the team's emergence into a restored New York symbolizes renewal and the possibility of redemption.
    - The tonal descent into loss is resolved by quiet survival, not cinematic excess.


  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Bob's internal battle within the Void's realm represents a profound personal crisis, pivotal to the narrative's resolution.
    - A moment of internal collapse anchors the moral cost of the fight.


  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: The team's initial defeat by the Sentry and the subsequent emergence of the Void convey a sense of hopelessness before their eventual triumph.
    - This beat is visualized as both physical defeat and emotional devastation.


  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The rebranding of the Thunderbolts as the New Avengers at the film's conclusion mirrors earlier themes of identity and transformation.
    - A visual and thematic callback to their transformative journey.


  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bob, initially perceived as a liability, ultimately overcomes his inner demons to save the team and the city.
    - The climax is driven by a previously marginalized character completing a hidden arc.


  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The team's coordinated efforts to confront the Void, including strategizing and arming themselves, are depicted through concise, purposeful sequences.
    - Grounded in character skills and communal memory, not genre shorthand.


  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The temporary subdual of the Sentry provides a fleeting sense of success before the more formidable threat of the Void emerges.
    - Hints of doubt are subtly planted before the safety collapses.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Visuals of the Watchtower and the encroaching darkness of the Void establish an ominous atmosphere.
    - These shots set tone without over-explanation, using natural detail to induce dread.


  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: The stillness preceding the Void's assault amplifies the suspense and underscores the gravity of the situation.
    - Cinematic calm used for maximum foreboding, not spectacle.


  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The closing scenes, juxtaposing the team's earlier disarray with their newfound unity, visually reinforce the narrative's themes of growth and redemption.
    - Cinematic closure is earned via image, not narration or exposition.


  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Action sequences, such as the team's escape from Valentina's trap, are choreographed to reflect character dynamics and escalate tension.
    - Movement and geography reflect character intent, not just plot propulsion.


  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The team's swift coordination and resource gathering are depicted through succinct montages.
    - Rhythmically cut but grounded in action that reflects emotional readiness.


  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Selective use of slow motion, particularly during critical confrontations, accentuates emotional stakes and character determination.
    - Used once, with emotional weight—never gratuitously.


  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Point-of-view shots during Bob's internal struggle provide insight into his psyche without disorienting the audience.
    - Emotional and symbolic rather than disorienting.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  21. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Void's manifestation, characterized by engulfing darkness and distorted realities, presents a unique and unsettling antagonist.
    - Horror is suggested through silence, posture, and unnatural behavior, not exaggeration.


  22. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The team's utilization of unconventional tactics and tools, such as exploiting the Void's weaknesses, showcases ingenuity and adaptability.
    - Iconic tools tied directly to the characters’ culture and available resources.


  23. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bob's confrontation with his childhood trauma within the Void symbolizes the broader theme of facing one's inner demons.
    - Symbolism arises from character arcs, not external plot contrivances.

I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Smoke as the disillusioned protector, Annie as the grounded healer, Sammie as the conflicted prodigy.

  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Sammie and Pearline’s tender courtship; Stack and Mary’s mournful rekindling.
    - These arcs evolve from shared pain, trust, and temptation rather than genre-convenient chemistry.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Annie’s knowledge of folk defense; Delta Slim’s blues mysticism.
    - Their support emerges from existing roles and accumulated wisdom, not plot convenience.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

    - Examples: Sammie’s transcendent performance unwittingly draws spirits and Remmick’s attention.
    - The threat rises organically from character-driven actions rooted in legacy and desire.


  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: A hushed joint before Sammie plays; a still field before sunrise.
    - Stillness and ambient tension precede every major eruption of violence or possession.


  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Smoke’s death followed by Sammie’s walk into daylight.
    - The tonal descent into loss is resolved by quiet survival, not cinematic excess.

  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)

    - This beat is visualized as both physical defeat and emotional devastation.


  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)

    - A visual and thematic callback to his transformative first performance.


  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Sammie smashing the silver guitar—long foreshadowed—as the pivotal act.
    - The climax is driven by a previously marginalized character completing a hidden arc.


  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Montage of community prepping garlic, silver, and spiritual protections.
    - Grounded in character skills and communal memory, not genre shorthand.


  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Belief that vampire-proofing is sufficient, just before betrayal and threshold breach.
    - Hints of doubt are subtly planted before the safety collapses.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Panning over cotton fields, the sawmill, and the moonlit road to the joint.
    - These shots set tone without over-explanation, using natural detail to induce dread.

    - Cinematic calm used for maximum foreboding, not spectacle.


  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)

    - Emotional and symbolic rather than disorienting.

Novocaine (Dan Berk & Robert Olsen, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Nathan as the pain-insensitive everyman turned vigilante; Sherry as the conflicted insider; Roscoe as the unlikely friend-ally.
    - Each character type begins with familiar cues but is expanded through evolving motives, emotional vulnerability, and surprise competencies.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Nathan’s quiet shame over his condition and perceived unworthiness; Sherry’s struggle with guilt and betrayal.
    - The arcs revolve around reclaiming agency through choice and confrontation, not forgiveness through plot convenience.


  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Nathan and Sherry’s flirtation and eventual connection develop slowly, with hesitation and mutual vulnerability.
    - Relationship beats build from insecurity, honesty, and shared trauma rather than genre-driven chemistry.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Roscoe, a virtual friend, becomes an unexpected support figure who risks his life for Nathan.
    - The bond grows organically from shared trust, humor, and mutual outsider status.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Examples: The robbery is initiated without full knowledge of how Nathan will react; Sherry’s internal conflict leads to unintended consequences.
    - The inciting incident cascades outward through character flaws and secrets, not just plot triggers.


  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s quiet routines and lonely life precede the chaos of the heist and his violent awakening.
    - The stillness and banality of his world make the intrusion of violence more jarring.


  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s hospital recovery, reduced sentence, and final bittersweet reunion with Sherry close the arc with emotional weight.
    - The conclusion lingers in moral grayness rather than false triumph.


  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan alone and captured in Andre’s trap, facing death and the limits of his condition.
    - The lowest point is defined not just by external peril, but an internal reckoning with pain, mortality, and identity.


  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Simon killing the police officer and abducting Nathan in the ambulance feels like the final failure.
    - Defeat is both personal (betrayal, injury) and situational (out of options, no support).


  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The cherry pie at the end echoes Nathan and Sherry’s first date and signals a return to humanity and sensation.
    - A small, humble image replaces spectacle, encapsulating emotional resolution.


  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan, underestimated and physically impaired, ends up defeating Simon and saving Sherry.
    - His heroism is reluctant, accidental, and hard-won—rooted in persistence, not power.


  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s DIY journey from office worker to quasi-investigator includes improvised strategy and resource gathering.
    - Pacing compresses time without losing plausibility—grounded in effort and urgency.


  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan successfully kills Ben and believes he’s closing in on Sherry, only to face a worse trap and the truth of her involvement.
    - The perceived win collapses into a deeper emotional betrayal.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Examples: The quiet, holiday-lit city and sterile credit union settings ground the early mood in detachment and routine.
    - Visual calm and emptiness support the film’s creeping tension.


  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Morning quiet at the bank before the costumed robbers enter violently.
    - Framing amplifies the contrast between domestic space and impending chaos.


  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nathan eating cherry pie in the final scene, mirroring the beginning of his bond with Sherry.
    - A visual symbol of emotional and sensory change—earned and quiet.


  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s pursuit of Sherry’s captors through mismatched cars and messy geography.
    - Sequences reflect inexperience and desperation, not slick polish.


  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan’s journey across town with help from Roscoe features clipped, urgent edits.
    - Momentum is driven by story needs and emotional stress, not music video logic.


  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The final fight uses brief slow motion sparingly to highlight impact (e.g., bone-through-jaw moment).
    - Violence is exaggerated only where catharsis is emotionally loaded.


  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV and chaotic handheld camera during torture and final confrontation with Simon.
    - Intimacy and pain are emphasized without visual incoherence.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  21. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Nathan uses hot grease, defibrillator paddles, and handcuffs as tools during combat.
    - Improvisation is driven by necessity and character limitation, not flourish.


  22. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The cherry pie as a stand-in for recovery and connection; the defibrillator as reversal and rebirth.
    - These objects evolve thematically from mundane to meaningful through repetition.

The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Bruce Wayne as the reluctant savior, Harvey Dent as the corrupted idealist, Joker as the unpredictable agent of chaos.
    - Archetypes are grounded in contradiction and evolution, defined more by moral ideology than surface traits.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Wayne’s emotional turmoil over Rachel, Dent’s internal battle with justice and revenge.
    - The characters confront inner darkness with lasting consequences, rather than tidy narrative healing.


  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The triangle between Bruce, Rachel, and Harvey is based on conflicted goals and unspoken regret.
    - Romantic beats are driven by philosophical conflict and deferred longing rather than genre convenience.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Alfred and Lucius Fox as moral and strategic anchors.
    - Both offer contrasting forms of support—Alfred through wisdom and withholding, Fox through principled boundaries.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: Batman’s presence escalates Gotham’s criminal arms race, paving the way for the Joker.
    - The story's central villain emerges from the protagonist’s actions, not coincidence.


  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Numerous moments of contemplative stillness—especially in Dent’s hospital scenes—prelude chaos.
    - These pauses amplify dread and moral unease before the next escalation.


  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Gotham’s citizens react in stunned quiet after the ferry scene and Dent’s death.
    - Emotional fallout is explored through consequence, not catharsis.


  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Batman confronting the surveillance state he’s created; Alfred burning Rachel’s letter.
    - These moral crises arise from internal conflict, not plot requirement.


  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Rachel’s death and Dent’s transformation to Two-Face mark the moral failure of the protagonists.
    - The emotional low point doubles as a political and spiritual collapse.


  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Batman fleeing into the shadows, his image redefined by Gordon’s closing monologue.
    - The conclusion echoes the film’s core question: can symbolism outweigh truth?


  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Batman must save Gotham by killing its hope (Dent’s legacy), becoming the villain.
    - Heroism is reframed as self-destruction, not applause.


  12. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Wayne upgrading his suit and Lucius setting up sonar tracking.
    - Preparation is mechanical and grounded, shown in precise, utilitarian beats.


  13. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Joker’s capture is framed as a triumph, only to result in Rachel’s death and Dent’s ruin.
    - The narrative undercuts every assumption of control, escalating stakes.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  14. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: The opening bank heist’s silent aerial descent onto Gotham skyscrapers.
    - Ominous framing replaces exposition, creating a foreboding tone without words.


  15. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Stillness in the interrogation room before Joker goads Batman into violence.
    - Silence becomes its own weapon in a film driven by tension and collapse.


  16. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Gordon’s son asking why Batman is running, echoing the film’s themes of sacrifice and public perception.
    - The visual echoes Batman’s transformation from protector to pariah.


  17. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Tumbler pursuit and Joker truck flip blend practical stunts with moral stakes.
    - Movement and geography reflect escalation, not spectacle for its own sake.


  18. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Batman equipping sonar surveillance; Gordon’s team prepping for Dent’s convoy.
    - Cutting is tight and functional, rooted in character-specific knowledge and skill.


  19. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Used sparingly, such as during explosions and Dent’s accident, to emphasize impact.
    - Never indulgent—timed for maximum thematic weight.


  20. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Minimal use, but brief subjective shots in Joker’s escape and sonar sequences reflect disorientation.
    - Employed strategically to symbolize surveillance or chaos without excess.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  21. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Harvey’s coin symbolizing control, fairness, and the illusion of justice; Joker’s scar stories as narrative misdirection.
    - Symbols and gestures evolve with character deterioration and transformation.

Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Brody as the landlocked lawman, Hooper as the privileged expert, Quint as the obsessed loner.
    - Each fits a recognizable mold but reveals emotional history, flaws, and evolving dynamics over time.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Brody’s fear of water, Quint’s survivor’s guilt from the USS Indianapolis.
    - Their arcs culminate not in melodrama but in decisions of courage under pressure.


  3. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Quint provides brutal experience, Hooper offers science, and both shape Brody's transformation.
    - Their guidance is hard-earned and friction-filled, grounding their roles in ideological conflict and mutual respect.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  4. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The mayor's decision to keep the beaches open for economic gain unleashes the shark’s continued rampage.
    - Human denial and economic short-sightedness, not the supernatural, provoke catastrophe.


  5. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quiet ocean scenes before attacks—such as Chrissie's swim and the calm before the Fourth of July chaos.
    - Stillness reinforces dread without relying on music or fast cuts.


  6. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: The community's gradual reckoning with the threat, culminating in Brody's final confrontation and Hooper’s survival.
    - Survival is presented as ambiguous triumph rather than clean rescue fantasy.


  7. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quint’s monologue about the USS Indianapolis.
    - This moment deepens Quint’s character and frames the shark as more than a creature—it’s a mythic adversary.


  8. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quint’s death, the boat’s destruction, and Brody left alone with the shark.
    - Visually and structurally, it’s the moment where all hope collapses before a final reversal.


  9. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Brody and Hooper paddling to shore on barrels—contrast with Brody’s earlier land-bound discomfort.
    - A quiet bookend that signals earned survival and internal change.


  10. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Brody, the least qualified, ultimately defeats the shark.
    - His triumph is not through strength, but through resolve and ingenuity under pressure.


  11. Rapid Preparation Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Outfitting the Orca before the final hunt.
    - A brisk yet character-driven sequence, grounded in practicality rather than flashy escalation.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  12. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Opening nighttime ocean shots and aerial views of Amity.
    - Sets an ominous tone using natural elements rather than overt supernatural cues.


  13. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Long, wide shots of the empty water just before an attack.
    - Uses negative space and visual restraint to amplify fear.


  14. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The quiet, steady final shot of the sea and shore.
    - Echoes the opening in tone but now contains resolution instead of ambiguity.


  15. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The shark pursuit at sea, with barrels trailing and quick boat maneuvers.
    - Chases use geography, tension, and weight instead of flashy speed.


  16. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Quick cuts of Brody, Hooper, and Quint loading the Orca.
    - Edited to reflect rising urgency while showing skill and preparation.


  17. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Minimal but present—seen in shark attacks and Brody’s final stand.
    - Used sparingly, enhancing emotion without overwhelming realism.


  18. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Underwater POV shots from the shark’s perspective.
    - Subjectivity is used for suspense but never disorients; it deepens viewer anxiety.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  19. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Brody’s use of a scuba tank as a last-ditch explosive.
    - The moment is iconic, but earned through setup and grounded in character desperation.


  20. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Quint’s scar-sharing scene and Hooper’s damaged cage represent vulnerability and fate.
    - Symbolism emerges from interaction, not decoration or forced metaphor.

Here's the next entry:

Slither (James Gunn, 2006) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Bill as the reluctant sheriff, Starla as the conflicted spouse, Grant as the grotesque tragic monster.
    - Each starts with familiar traits but subverts or deepens those roles with humor, trauma, and desire.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Grant’s lingering humanity despite being host to the alien hive, Bill's leadership under pressure.
    - Redemption arises not through heroism, but by resisting despair and choosing others over self.


  3. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Kylie serves as an unexpected moral compass and source of intel; Jack adds both comic relief and cynical foil.
    - Each supporting figure enriches the main arc and expands the world’s psychological landscape.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  4. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The meteorite's arrival and Grant’s infection open the door to annihilation.
    - The alien menace escalates organically from human vulnerability and curiosity.


  5. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quiet domestic moments—Grant watching Starla sleep or Starla walking through their home—precede carnage.
    - Calm is used to magnify terror, not relax the viewer.


  6. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: The town is devastated, but the survivors walk into dawn—not triumph, but endurance.
    - The ending evokes survival through loss rather than Hollywood catharsis.


  7. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Starla confronting the remnants of her husband inside the monster.
    - A metaphorical and literal reckoning with what has been lost and what remains worth saving.


  8. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Starla and Jack are captured; Bill’s grenade fails; Kylie is pinned—chaos overtakes all plans.
    - The emotional low point where survival seems hopeless.


  9. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The trio walking away as the only survivors recalls the intimacy of earlier group scenes, now fractured.
    - It reflects thematic loss while visually reinforcing survival.


  10. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bill, not the alpha or action archetype, ultimately kills the monster through luck and resolve.
    - The ordinary man’s resourcefulness trumps the trope of physical domination.


  11. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The discovery of Brenda seems to offer clarity, but it’s a trap that spreads infection.
    - Hope turns into escalation, not relief.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  12. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Opening shots of Wheelsy and the meteorite’s crash set a foreboding but ironic tone.
    - Foreshadows the invasion with slow-burn dread and B-movie homage.


  13. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Still frames of townspeople mid-infection contrast with the chaos to follow.
    - Uses stillness to tease horror lurking beneath the familiar.


  14. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The three survivors leaving town echoes their earlier, mundane small-town lives—now altered forever.
    - A visual epilogue of loss and unlikely kinship.


  15. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bill and Kylie fleeing infected townsfolk through suburban streets and alien-infested homes.
    - Geography and movement build suspense rather than spectacle.


  16. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Weapon gathering and town defense sequences before the final showdown.
    - Chaotic, comedic, and pragmatic—reflecting genre tone.


  17. Slow Motion Action Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The explosion of Grant is stylized but brief.
    - Used for grotesque effect, never lingering for glamor.


  18. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV slug-cam sequences simulate infection and disorientation.
    - Adds narrative clarity through horror perspective without excessive chaos.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  19. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The parasitic slug design and Grant’s grotesque mutation mix horror, humor, and body horror tradition.
    - Taps into primal disgust while innovating visually.


  20. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Propane tanks, brushes, and ad hoc gear used in life-or-death scenarios.
    - Desperation fuels creativity, with real-world logic intact.


  21. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Grant sparing Starla out of love even in monstrous form.
    - Symbolizes the tragic persistence of human memory within corruption.

Attack the Block (Joe Cornish, 2011) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Moses as a teenage gang leader with depth, Samantha as a cautious nurse forced into alliance, Brewis as the unlikely academic.
    - Archetypes are subverted through moral transformation, empathy, and generational exchange.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses grapples with guilt and societal judgment, ultimately risking his life to save his block.
    - His arc moves from alienation to heroic responsibility, reframing urban youth as potential protectors.


  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Hints of romantic interest between Moses and Tia, restrained and quietly respectful.
    - Never prioritized above survival or character growth, avoiding genre shortcuts.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ron, the laid-back drug dealer, and Brewis, the clumsy stoner/zoologist, both offer insight and assistance.
    - Their value lies in surprising competence and emotional loyalty.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The gang’s killing of the first alien triggers the invasion by attracting the males via pheromones.
    - Violence backfires, rooted in misunderstanding, not malice.


  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Interludes of quiet—kids walking home, characters hiding—precede sudden violence.
    - Used for tension rather than cheap jumps.


  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses survives the explosion, arrested but hailed as a hero by the neighborhood.
    - A grounded resolution that blends realism with redemption.


  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses learning his actions brought danger, deciding to sacrifice himself for the block.
    - The emotional low point reorients him from survival to self-sacrifice.


  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Most of the gang is dead, the aliens overwhelm every safe space, and Moses prepares to die.
    - Reflects not just physical danger, but emotional isolation.


  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The cheering block bookends Moses’s introduction, now recast through admiration rather than fear.
    - Reflects earned identity transformation.


  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Moses, the marginalized protagonist, saves the block alone by drawing all the creatures to himself.
    - Heroism emerges from circumstance and conviction, not design.


  12. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Temporary safety in the girls’ flat quickly unravels with Dennis’s death.
    - Illusions of safety collapse under relentless escalation.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  13. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Tower block exteriors lit by fireworks create foreboding with urban authenticity.
    - Grounded visual tone replaces stylized menace.


  14. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Stillness during stealth scenes contrasts with frenzied attacks.
    - Builds rhythm and anticipation.


  15. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Moses in handcuffs, framed as a hero through crowd chants and a proud smile.
    - Cinematic punctuation of internal transformation.


  16. Dynamic Chase Sequences (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The gang sprinting through the estate’s stairwells and alleys.
    - Geography reflects territory and stakes.


  17. Rapid Montages for Preparation (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Weapon-gathering scenes use tight edits and tension-building cuts.
    - Kinetic but thematically driven by desperation.


  18. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: POV shots during alien chases through smoke and darkness.
    - Enhances immersion without sacrificing clarity.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  19. Alien Appearance and Characteristics Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Bioluminescent jaws, eyeless black fur, and echolocation-based tracking.
    - Design combines menace with minimalism, avoiding cliché humanoid features.


  20. Weapon Improvisation and Action Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Fireworks, baseball bats, and machetes are repurposed with DIY strategy.
    - Emphasizes ingenuity over brute force.


  21. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Moses running with the female alien’s corpse as bait.
    - Becomes a metaphor for guilt, responsibility, and earned adulthood.

The Descendants (Alexander Payne, 2011) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Complex Character Archetypes (Low Risk)
    - Examples: Matt King as a passive land baron forced into active moral decision-making, Alex as a rebellious teen with hidden empathy, Sid as a slacker masking deeper emotional intelligence.
    - Characters avoid oversimplification by evolving through grief, confrontation, and layered relational shifts.


  2. Personal Demons and Redemption (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt's journey from emotional detachment to active parenting and moral leadership.
    - Redemption is earned through exposure to betrayal, familial collapse, and existential uncertainty.


  3. Developing Romantic Relationships (Medium Risk)
    - Example: No new romance is forced into the narrative, but Matt's re-examination of love post-infidelity serves as a subtle reawakening.
    - The emotional space left by Elizabeth’s coma is respected rather than filled.


  4. Mentor and Support Characters (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Characters like Julie Speer and Scott Thorson act as emotional mirrors and boundary enforcers for Matt.
    - These figures add moral complexity without providing easy answers.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  5. Catalyst and Unwittingly Unleashing Evil (Low Risk)
    - Example: The boating accident and Elizabeth’s coma catalyze Matt’s unraveling family structure and inheritance dilemma.
    - The inciting trauma is mundane but life-altering, driving internal and external conflict.


  6. Silence Before the Storm (Low Risk)
    - Example: Long, quiet scenes on hospital grounds, beaches, and in cars precede revelations and emotional collapse.
    - Used to accentuate interiority rather than tension.


  7. Aftermath and Rescue (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt and his daughters eat ice cream post-funeral, silently recovering together under a hospital blanket.
    - The healing is modest, symbolic, and believable.


  8. Dark Night of the Soul (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt quietly watching his comatose wife while learning the affair was real and that she wanted a divorce.
    - The emotional climax is inward, not performative.


  9. All Is Lost Sequence (Low Risk)
    - Example: Matt must tell Scottie the truth about her mother and face the looming familial vote on the land.
    - He appears cornered both emotionally and ethically.


  10. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: The family huddled under the same hospital blanket watching TV mirrors earlier scenes of disconnected cohabitation.
    - Signals earned intimacy and unspoken reconciliation.


  11. Prohibited Hero Saves the Day (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Matt goes against the financial interests of his extended family to preserve the land’s legacy.
    - His heroism is moral and civic, not physical or confrontational.


  12. Midpoint False Victory (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Finding and confronting Brian Speer feels like catharsis, but changes nothing about Elizabeth’s condition.
    - Emotional relief is replaced by moral ambiguity and further grief.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  13. Eerie Establishing Shot (Low Risk)
    - Example: Aerial shots of untouched Hawaiian landscape reflect both paradise and impending erosion—literal and emotional.
    - Natural imagery functions as both setting and metaphor.


  14. Silence Before the Storm (Visual) (Low Risk)
    - Example: Quiet walks through hospital corridors or lingering wide shots before a revelation.
    - Allows emotional tension to build through space, not sound.


  15. Final Image Callback (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ice cream on the couch with Elizabeth’s hospital blanket bookends the arc of familial alienation.
    - Closure is achieved without dialogue.


  16. Overwrought Subjective Camera (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Occasional use of soft-focus or long lens to reflect Matt’s growing detachment or realization.
    - Minimalist and selective, not melodramatic.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  17. Specific Character Moments and Symbolism Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scattering Elizabeth’s ashes into the ocean off Waikiki signifies both cultural rootedness and emotional release.
    - Symbolism is emotionally grounded, not abstract or manipulative.


  18. Family Legacy and Responsibility Tropes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The contested inheritance of the Kauai land serves as a metaphor for stewardship, identity, and values.
    - Tropes of generational wealth are interrogated through ethical rather than dramatic conflict.


  19. Secret Affair Discovered Post-Trauma (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Alex’s reveal of Elizabeth’s affair complicates Matt’s grief and propels the film’s second act.
    - A common device, but handled with restraint and psychological complexity.

Scream (Wes Craven, 1996) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Final Girl Archetype (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sidney Prescott is positioned as a traditional “final girl,” but with meta-awareness and evolving agency.
    - Unlike classic slasher heroines, Sidney adapts, fights back, and retains narrative control.


  2. Charismatic Killer (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Billy Loomis and Stu Macher are flippant, articulate, self-aware, and pop-culture literate.
    - Their likability masks psychopathy, leaning on the trope but subverting it with coded subtext and satire.


  3. Pop-Culture Savvy Youths (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Randy Meeks acts as a walking encyclopedia of slasher rules.
    - The device walks a line between insightful parody and overused trope, but is well-integrated.


  4. Faux-Victim Turned Killer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Billy fakes being stabbed to appear a victim.
    - The bait-and-switch tactic is effective but later became widely imitated across the genre.


  5. Overbearing Parent Figure (Low Risk)
    - Example: Maureen Prescott’s posthumous legacy drives the entire plot.
    - Her choices and reputation control the arcs of multiple characters, though she never appears alive on screen.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  6. Self-Aware Genre Deconstruction (Low Risk)
    - Example: Randy's horror survival rules and the meta-commentary in nearly every scene.
    - Forms the backbone of the narrative and revitalized the horror genre; not just a gimmick.


  7. Red Herring Setup (Medium Risk)
    - Examples: Cotton Weary, Neil Prescott, and even Billy himself until he’s “cleared.”
    - The misdirection adds tension, but is a staple trope repeated across many slasher films.


  8. Double Killer Twist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Both Billy and Stu revealed as Ghostface.
    - Highly effective in this first instance, but now an expected twist in ensemble slashers.


  9. Opening Scene Kill (Low Risk)
    - Example: Drew Barrymore’s shocking death.
    - The subversion of casting expectations raised the bar for all future horror openings.


  10. Framed Innocent (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Cotton Weary, falsely convicted of Maureen’s murder.
    - Common in mystery-thrillers, but used here to expand the narrative world across sequels.


  11. House Party Climax (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Stu’s house serves as the setting for the final 42-minute bloodbath.
    - While it’s thematically and logistically functional, it’s a familiar teen horror setup.


  12. Killer Monologue (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Billy’s “movies don’t create psychos” speech, and his justification for revenge.
    - Justified by the genre commentary, but still leans on a standard exposition trope.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  13. Prolonged Chase Scenes (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sidney’s multiple escapes and defensive maneuvers.
    - Tense but grounded in believable spatial logic and character competence.


  14. Masked Killer POV Shots (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Several sequences shot through the lens of Ghostface’s perspective.
    - Classical horror technique; used here with clarity but not innovation.


  15. Horror Score Subversion (Low Risk)
    - Example: Beltrami’s mix of Western themes and horror beats.
    - Underscores suspense while avoiding recycled cues; effective reimagining of genre music.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  16. Female Trauma as Plot Engine (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Maureen’s past as a victim and alleged adulterer directly motivates the killers and drives Sidney’s arc.
    - While addressed and critiqued within the film, it still leans on female suffering to fuel male violence.


  17. Phone Call Threats (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Casey and Sidney’s scenes with the killer voice.
    - Used to iconic effect, but replicates a trope now common in horror films.


  18. Comic Relief Male (Low Risk)
    - Example: Dewey as the bumbling yet lovable officer.
    - Not just comic relief—he’s shown to be brave, competent, and emotionally grounded by the finale.


  19. Twist Ending + Fakeout Kill (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Billy’s final leap at Sidney before she shoots him “in the head.”

Logan (James Mangold, 2017) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. The Old Warrior (Low Risk)
    - Example: Logan is aged, weary, and suffering physical decline.
    - The trope is given full narrative weight and explored with genuine empathy and depth.


  2. Father-Daughter Surrogate Bond (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan and Laura form a reluctant but emotional parent-child bond.
    - The trope is common in action-adjacent dramas but handled here with rich subtext and gradual development.


  3. Terminal Mentor (Low Risk)
    - Example: Xavier, once powerful, is now frail and mentally unstable.
    - Played with intense vulnerability, providing dignity and danger in equal measure.


  4. Child Weapon Turned Innocent (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Laura is a genetically-engineered killing machine who learns empathy and identity.
    - Despite surface cliché, her arc is individuated and never reduced to simplistic purity.


  5. Comic Relief Mutant (Low Risk)
    - Example: Caliban is used sparingly for tension relief and moral weight.
    - A restrained version of this trope that avoids undermining tone or stakes.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  6. One Last Job (Low Risk)
    - Example: Logan takes on one final mission despite personal cost.
    - A core structure of many Westerns, used here to deepen existential themes rather than glamorize action.


  7. Road Trip as Redemption (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The journey north becomes a path to self-realization and closure.
    - Familiar structurally but elevated by the bleak setting and the film's refusal to offer easy answers.


  8. Shadow Clone Villain (Medium Risk)
    - Example: X-24 is a mindless, younger version of Logan.
    - As a literal embodiment of Logan’s past and violent legacy, it walks the line between trope and metaphor.


  9. Heroic Sacrifice (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan dies saving the next generation, rejecting his role as weapon.
    - Iconic within genre fiction, but fully earned here by thematic and emotional groundwork.


  10. Corporate Eugenics Conspiracy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Transigen engineers children to suppress and replace mutants.
    - Familiar dystopian trope, but it supports Logan’s political and philosophical tone.


  11. Weaponized Children as Hope (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The new generation of mutants represents salvation for the future.
    - The idea verges on cliché but avoids sentimentality by keeping stakes grounded and ambiguous.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  12. Neo-Western Visual Language (Low Risk)
    - Example: Desert landscapes, long takes, silences, and Shane references.
    - Clear genre homage, but deeply integrated with theme and tone, not just aesthetic mimicry.


  13. Hero Walks into Ambush (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan confronts Rice and Pierce head-on.
    - Standard setup in action drama; partially subverted by Logan’s exhaustion and loss.


  14. Showdown at the Homestead (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Xavier is killed and Laura is kidnapped during the family’s hospitality.
    - Evokes Western massacre tropes; emotionally devastating but narratively familiar.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  15. Mutant Serum as Deus Ex Machina (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Logan uses a green serum to recover temporarily for the final battle.
    - The effect is telegraphed but serves the structure more than character growth.


  16. Unseen Mass Extinction (Low Risk)
    - Example: No mutants have been born in 25 years, and most are presumed dead.
    - Used for mood and thematic backdrop rather than over-explained world-building.


  17. Legacy Cross (Low Risk)
    - Example: Laura turns Logan’s grave cross into an “X.”
    - Visually powerful and understated—symbolic rather than melodramatic.


  18. Found Family (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The group of mutant children become a new tribe.
    - Common in genre fiction but modestly portrayed without over-sentimental beats.


  19. Offscreen Tragedy Backstory (Low Risk)
    - Example: Xavier’s seizure killed the X-Men, but it’s never shown.
    - Evocative use of implied trauma rather than visual exposition.

    - Example: Laura quotes Shane during Logan’s burial.
    - Poignant but recognizable; justified by prior scene integration.

Black Widow (Cate Shortland, 2021) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Tragic Past Heroine (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha’s past as a child assassin and her guilt over “Dreykov’s daughter.”
    - While effective in giving her complexity, it relies on overused trauma-as-backstory beats.


  2. Surrogate Sister Dynamic (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha and Yelena form a quippy, tense, but ultimately affectionate bond.
    - The chemistry is praised, and the relationship avoids lazy rivalry or idealized sisterhood.


  3. Female Assassin Turned Redeemer (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha works to dismantle the Red Room and save future Widows.
    - A genre staple but balanced here with commentary on systemic abuse and manipulation.


  4. Stoic Spy as Action Lead (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha keeps her cool under pressure, relying on cunning over superpowers.
    - Her emotional restraint is integrated with plot rather than flat character masking.


  5. Comic Relief Sidekick (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Alexei’s bluster and self-importance provide levity.
    - Frequently veers into broad caricature but has occasional emotional beats.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  6. Found Family of Misfits (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha reunites with her spy “family” for one last mission.
    - A well-worn setup that gains freshness through tonal whiplash between dysfunction and care.


  7. Face-Switch Reveal (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha and Melina swap identities using mask tech.
    - Classic spy trickery that fits the genre and timeline naturally.


  8. Evil Father Figure (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dreykov rules over the Widows with controlling and dehumanizing systems.
    - Real-world metaphors are embedded, but the depiction borders on mustache-twirling villainy.


  9. Chemical Mind Control (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Widows are controlled via engineered pheromone blockers and chemical agents.
    - Narrative function is solid, but the trope is well-worn in sci-fi and spy genres.


  10. Brainwashed Super Soldier (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Taskmaster is revealed to be Antonia, now programmed for violence.
    - Conceptually rich but limited character agency makes her arc feel underexplored.


  11. One Final Mission Before the End (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha confronts her past before rejoining the Avengers.
    - Typical framing for “prequel-finale,” but helps reframe her legacy.


  12. Redemption via Sacrifice (Low Risk)
    - Example: Natasha’s arc concludes with a mission focused on freeing others.
    - Earned within the character's legacy; avoids overly sentimental framing.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  13. Midair Fortress Collapse (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The Red Room explodes mid-sky, triggering a high-altitude fall sequence.
    - Visually elaborate but narratively familiar; nearly every major spy/superhero film has a sky-fall.


  14. Rooftop Chase and Car Crashes (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha and Yelena flee Taskmaster across Budapest.
    - Highly kinetic but structured around genre-standard geography and beat progression.


  15. Dual Fight Montage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Shostakov vs Taskmaster and Romanoff vs Widows occur simultaneously.
    - Adds momentum but relies on typical parallel fight structure to maintain tension.


  16. Feminine Grit Gaze (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Opening credits juxtapose young girls’ faces with oppressive Cold War imagery.
    - Intense and ambitious, but runs the risk of stylizing real trauma into genre mood.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  17. Antagonist Reveal Twist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Taskmaster is actually Dreykov’s daughter.
    - While thematic, the twist lacks emotional payoff due to limited character development.


  18. Sentimental Object as Legacy (Low Risk)
    - Example: Yelena’s vest is passed to Natasha, later seen in *Infinity War*.
    - Works well to bridge character continuity; subtle and tactile.


  19. Villain Monologue Before Escape (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dreykov gloats before narrowly escaping.
    - Standard genre habit, but here it costs narrative urgency.


  20. Posthumous Retcon Tribute (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Natasha’s grave and Yelena’s visit retroactively frame her MCU death with meaning.
    - Emotionally effective, but a classic device to retrofit emotional closure.

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (Goldstein & Daley, 2023) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Charming Rogue with a Heart (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Edgin is a bard-turned-thief who just wants his daughter back.
    - Standard archetype for heist leaders; elevated by Pine’s charisma but structurally predictable.


  2. Badass Woman with a Big Weapon (Low Risk)
    - Example: Holga smashes enemies with brute strength and little emotional expressiveness.
    - Rodriguez’s presence avoids parody; trope feels archetypal, not reductive.


  3. The Awkward Yet Gifted Mage (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Simon struggles with confidence until plot demands he master the Helm.
    - Familiar arc of insecurity-to-mastery but well paced and grounded in party dynamics.


  4. Straight-Laced Paladin as Comic Foil (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Xenk is overly noble, humorously oblivious to irony.
    - Borderline “NPC” functionality; succeeds more as meta-humor than emotional character.


  5. Sarcastic Youngster Outsider (Low Risk)
    - Example: Doric is a socially prickly shapeshifter who joins begrudgingly.
    - Refreshes the trope with grounded motivations (anti-deforestation, personal ethics).


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  6. Assemble the Crew (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Recruiting a team for a heist, each with one key skill.
    - Works in context of genre blending (heist/fantasy) but follows familiar narrative rhythm.


  7. Fetch Quest Structure (Low Risk)
    - Example: Multiple mini-quests (graveyard, dragon lair, magical relic) drive the plot.
    - Mirrors D&D campaigns faithfully; structurally generic but thematically coherent.


  8. Villain’s Betrayal Twist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Forge frames Edgin, then plots a grand undead ceremony.
    - Standard genre double-cross; Grant’s camp performance adds some unpredictability.


  9. Magical McGuffin with One Use (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Tablet of Reawakening can bring back one person.
    - Drives emotional payoff, but its rules are narratively convenient and unexplored.


  10. The Wrong Person Dies (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Holga dies just as the party wins.
    - Setup for the ultimate character sacrifice reversal via McGuffin; sincere, but familiar.


  11. Redemption via Family Realization (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Edgin realizes he was chasing his wife’s memory for selfish reasons.
    - Plays well emotionally but fits standard Disney-fied self-awareness redemption arcs.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  12. Heist Cutaway Planning (Low Risk)
    - Example: Visual flash-forwards of plan execution, then plan fails mid-sequence.
    - Clever in execution and genre-fit; recognizable but delightfully handled.


  13. Crowd Distraction with Flying Riches (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Riches scattered from balloon to save townsfolk from spell.
    - Feel-good payoff device reused from countless Robin Hood/Aladdin variants.


  14. Arena Escape Sequence (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Gladiator-style games used as trap before daring escape.
    - Entertaining, but matches genre conventions for "bait and switch" tension.


  15. Large CGI Creature as Boss Fight (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Chubby red dragon Themberchaud and undead-horde finale.
    - Spectacle is fun but formulaic; less about stakes, more about visuals.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  16. Magic Wears Off at Convenient Time (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Simon fails repeatedly with the Helm—until he doesn't.
    - Character arc-compatible but uses selective success timing for plot convenience.


  17. The Villain Who Monologues (Low Risk)
    - Example: Sofina explains the undead plot while preparing mass mind control.
    - Baked into the D&D tone—less Bond-villain, more fantasy-overexposition.


  18. “NPC” Ally with Plot-Critical Guidance (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Xenk Yendar appears, guides the team, then disappears.
    - Plays on D&D structure, but limits his agency outside of quest function.


  19. One Last Look at the Fallen Comrade (Low Risk)
    - Example: Edgin’s farewell to Holga before resurrecting her.
    - Classic emotional beat—handled with warmth, not melodrama.


  20. Post-Mission Public Acclaim (Low Risk)
    - Example: The group is declared “Heroes of the Realm.”
    - Conventional but earned; narrative closure is celebratory rather than subversive.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (Wright, 2010) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Manic Pixie Dream Girl (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ramona Flowers is a mysterious, emotionally distant muse with changing hair and unexplained history.
    - Subverted somewhat by her agency in leaving Gideon and the ending’s introspective tone, but retains core trope DNA.


  2. The Lovable Slacker (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scott Pilgrim is underemployed, emotionally juvenile, and floats between romances without accountability.
    - Cera’s charm and the film’s meta-comedy soften this, but the trope is foundational to his arc.


  3. The Cool Gay Roommate (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Wallace Wells is hyper-witty, sexually confident, and emotionally detached.
    - Iconically played by Culkin but primarily functions as comic relief and plot nudger.


  4. Underwritten Young Love Interest (Low Risk)
    - Example: Knives Chau is loyal, obsessive, and easily manipulated.
    - Her character matures by the end, but her teen infatuation is exaggerated for comic payoff.


  5. Female Villain Played for Kink (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Roxy Richter, Ramona’s ex, is a dominatrix-coded ninja whose defeat is sexualized.
    - Gendered trope not fully interrogated, though wrapped in parody and visual irony.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  6. Battle for the Girl (Medium Risk)
    - Example: The entire premise revolves around Scott fighting other men for Ramona’s affection.
    - Subverted by the final act’s shift to “Power of Self-Respect,” but core romantic objectification remains.


  7. Expository Dream Girl Appears in a Dream (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scott literally dreams of Ramona before meeting her.
    - Stylized framing emphasizes narrative contrivance; leans into rather than away from cliché.


  8. Evil Exes as Episodic Boss Fights (Low Risk)
    - Example: Seven uniquely styled exes represent escalating narrative obstacles.
    - Intentionally constructed as video game parody; trope is aestheticized rather than emotionally functional.


  9. Final Boss with Mind Control (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Gideon implants Ramona with a chip to control her.
    - Undermines Ramona’s autonomy in the climax, though partially reclaimed afterward.


  10. Redemption Through Self-Realization (Low Risk)
    - Example: Scott re-fights Gideon not for Ramona, but for himself.
    - Standard redemption arc that resolves internal flaw through metaphysical combat metaphor.


  11. The Other Girl Lets Him Go (Low Risk)
    - Example: Knives bows out gracefully, endorsing Scott’s decision to be with Ramona.
    - Clean closure with some emotional payoff, though functionally tidy.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  12. On-Screen Text and Sound Effects (Low Risk)
    - Example: “Thud,” “Pow,” “K.O.,” level-up icons, and visual music synesthesia.
    - Stylistic innovation that transforms clichés into aesthetic function.


  13. Split-Screen for Simultaneous Reactions (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Intercutting domestic scenes with visual punchlines and reaction shots.
    - Stylish but not revolutionary; common in sitcoms and comic-book-inspired media.


  14. Flashy Fight Choreography with Comic Stylization (Low Risk)
    - Example: Over-the-top martial arts scenes mimicking both anime and arcade combat.
    - A knowingly heightened take on a well-worn style; trope-awareness saves it.


  15. Romantic Montage with Musical Underscore (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Music cues that correspond with Scott’s shifting affections.
    - Conventional cue structure beneath aesthetic flair.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


  16. Evil Twin/Dark Self Battle (Low Risk)
    - Example: Nega-Scott appears as the final test—then turns out to be friendly.
    - Lampshades the cliché with comedy; a satire more than a sincere plot threat.


  17. Hipster Music as Personality Shortcut (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Band affiliations used to quickly define character alignment and style.
    - Deepens Toronto’s indie scene homage but leans on shorthand for emotional resonance.


  18. "Level Up" as Character Growth Mechanic (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Emotional growth represented by RPG-style score and sword upgrades.
    - Clever but mechanical metaphor risks hollowing emotional beats.


  19. Ex Machina Revive Mechanic (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Scott dies and uses his 1-UP to come back stronger.
    - Fits the aesthetic but resolves death consequence-free.


  20. The Girl Is the Prize (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Winning Ramona is framed as the endpoint.
    - Challenged by character self-reflection but still aligns with romantic conquest coding.

  1. Token Girl in the Group (Medium Risk)
    - Example: April O'Neil is the only major female character in the main ensemble.
    - Elevated by Edebiri’s distinct, grounded performance and her own narrative agency, but still isolated gender-wise.

    - Mitigated by emphasis on adolescence rather than intelligence.


  3. Wise Mentor Parent (Low Risk)

  4. Chill/Funny Black Teen Sidekick Energy (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Michelangelo’s voice and demeanor fall into familiar patterns of the comedic “chill” archetype.
    - Balanced by his vulnerability and youth, but still plays to type.

    - Given moments of tenderness and balance to round out the character.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES

    - Familiar “villain wants to change the world” trope; rescued by humor and mutant relatability.


  8. The Big Fight Saves the World (Low Risk)

    - Classic climax, redeemed by chaotic charm and ensemble execution.


  9. Villain Turns into Giant Monster (Medium Risk)

    - Clear trope, though emotionally motivated and thematically fitting.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


  11. Hyper-Stylized Urban Chaos (Low Risk)
    - Example: New York is rendered with graffiti-like texture and handheld-inspired movement.
    - Purposeful and emotionally resonant; not a trope so much as a genre signature.


  12. Retro-Hip-Hop Montage to Establish Cool (Low Risk)
    - Example: Needle drops like “No Diggity” frame bonding and fight prep.
    - Familiar but justified through tone, setting, and era specificity.


  13. Glowing MacGuffin Device (Medium Risk)
    - Example: TCRI’s retro-mutagen is brightly colored and conveniently explodes.
    - Necessary for the narrative, but follows typical design cues.


  14. Pop Culture Reference Avalanche (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Layered references from anime to Marvel to vintage games.
    - Fun for genre-savvy viewers, but risks overloading newcomers.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES

    - Uplifting and swift, but requires quick emotional buy-in.

    - Common setup, only lightly complicated by Cynthia Utrom’s characterization.

    - Quick resolution mechanism, standard for animated family fare.

    - Classic sci-fi trope; framed sweetly here but familiar.

 10. Romantic Code Revelation (Medium Risk)

    - Visually slick but standard for gaming-themed narratives.


 12. Pop Culture Weapon Parade (Medium Risk)

    - Example: Ellie and Dina’s relationship deepens during their vengeance quest.
    - Emotional weight present, but timing follows familiar patterns.


 14. The “We’re Not So Different” Theme (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie and Abby’s arcs mirror each other in trauma and retribution.
    - Core to the show’s themes, but clearly derived from narrative tradition.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


 15. War-Torn Urban Jungle (Low Risk)
    - Example: Seattle as a shattered militarized zone filled with factions and infection.
    - Visually striking but part of the post-apocalyptic genre’s standard toolkit.


 16. Brutalist Medical Facilities as Horror Zones (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Lakehill hospital teased as site of critical confrontation.
    - Effective but well-trodden setting for both horror and moral ambiguity.


 17. Handheld Chaos Aesthetic (Low Risk)
    - Example: Battle sequences use vérité-style chaos to heighten immersion.
    - Gritty and immediate but common in prestige action drama.


 18. Mutated Zombies as Environmental Pressure (Low Risk)
    - Example: New infected types push characters into harder moral or emotional terrain.
    - Consistent with genre, adds novelty but still familiar.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


 19. Secret Immunity Reveal (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dina learns Ellie is immune only after Ellie is bitten.
    - Delayed revelation is emotionally charged but structurally conventional.


 20. The “Factions Are Just as Bad” Moral (Medium Risk)
    - Example: WLF and Seraphites are both shown as violent and flawed.
    - Thematic complexity risks becoming nihilism if not balanced carefully.


 21. Hidden Infection Vector Returns (Low Risk)
    - Example: Spores return as a subtle nod to fans and an atmospheric danger.
    - Enhances world continuity, but their surprise reintroduction is a classic reset trope.


 22. Flashback-as-Episode Framing (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Isaac’s 2018 backstory opens the episode to contextualize current motives.
    - Adds emotional weight but predictable structural move.


 23. Comedic Actor Cast Against Type (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Catherine O’Hara plays a dramatic role in contrast to concurrent comedy.
    - Works well but fits recent prestige-TV casting trends.


 24. Narrative Anchoring in a Single Object (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ellie leaving coffee beans on Joel’s grave.
    - Simple and poignant, though symbolic-object-as-emotional-anchor is very common.

The Last of Us: Season 2 (Mazin & Druckmann, 2025) — Low & Medium Plausibility Clichés Detected


I. CHARACTER-AFFECTING TROPES


  1. Grief-Driven Avenger (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie’s arc centers on vengeance after Joel’s murder.
    - Emotionally grounded but follows a familiar "revenge quest" structure.


  2. Stoic Assassin With a Heart (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Abby is a hardened killer but shown with emotional depth and complex motivations.
    - Attempts humanization, but fits a recognizable “sympathetic enforcer” mold.


  3. The Dead Mentor Catalyst (Low Risk)
    - Example: Joel’s death propels all primary character arcs.
    - Classic motivator trope used with nuance, but still archetypal.


  4. The Pregnant Burden (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dina’s pregnancy complicates her ability to participate in combat.
    - Adds emotional weight but risks reducing her role to a device.


  5. The Traumatized Child Hero (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ellie is both emotionally broken and incredibly capable.
    - Deep performance, but the juxtaposition of trauma and toughness is familiar.


  6. Guilt-Ridden Protector (Low Risk)
    - Example: Joel struggles with his past and choices before dying.
    - A somber, understated version of a well-worn trope.


  7. The Violent Woman Proving Herself (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Abby’s strength and brutality are contrasted with her femininity.
    - Well-acted but leans into “brutal woman as subversive” framing.


  8. The Token Redeemed Racist (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Seth redeems himself by helping Ellie and Dina escape Jackson.
    - Plays into “bigot with a conscience” trope—functional, but familiar.


II. NARRATIVE/THEME-AFFECTING TROPES


  9. The Revenge Spiral (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Season’s thematic arc is built around revenge begetting more violence.
    - Profound in tone, but the escalation structure is genre-standard.


 10. Post-Apocalypse as Emotional Mirror (Low Risk)
    - Example: Society’s collapse reflects internal character decay and struggle.
    - Genre-appropriate and effective, but not original.


 11. Surprise Character Death (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Joel’s murder early in the season.
    - Powerfully executed, but it remains a sudden-death shock tactic.


 12. Nonlinear Flashback Structure (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Abby’s backstory and timeline are interwoven retroactively.
    - Enhances depth, but disrupts momentum and clarity for some viewers.


 13. Romantic Complication During Mission (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie and Dina’s relationship deepens during their vengeance quest.
    - Emotional weight present, but timing follows familiar patterns.


 14. The “We’re Not So Different” Theme (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Ellie and Abby’s arcs mirror each other in trauma and retribution.
    - Core to the show’s themes, but clearly derived from narrative tradition.


III. CINEMATOGRAPHY-AFFECTING TROPES


 15. War-Torn Urban Jungle (Low Risk)
    - Example: Seattle as a shattered militarized zone filled with factions and infection.
    - Visually striking but part of the post-apocalyptic genre’s standard toolkit.


 16. Brutalist Medical Facilities as Horror Zones (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Lakehill hospital teased as site of critical confrontation.
    - Effective but well-trodden setting for both horror and moral ambiguity.


 17. Handheld Chaos Aesthetic (Low Risk)
    - Example: Battle sequences use vérité-style chaos to heighten immersion.
    - Gritty and immediate but common in prestige action drama.


 18. Mutated Zombies as Environmental Pressure (Low Risk)
    - Example: New infected types push characters into harder moral or emotional terrain.
    - Consistent with genre, adds novelty but still familiar.


IV. ADDITIONAL MINOR/MISCELLANEOUS TROPES


 19. Secret Immunity Reveal (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Dina learns Ellie is immune only after Ellie is bitten.
    - Delayed revelation is emotionally charged but structurally conventional.


 20. The “Factions Are Just as Bad” Moral (Medium Risk)
    - Example: WLF and Seraphites are both shown as violent and flawed.
    - Thematic complexity risks becoming nihilism if not balanced carefully.


 21. Hidden Infection Vector Returns (Low Risk)
    - Example: Spores return as a subtle nod to fans and an atmospheric danger.
    - Enhances world continuity, but their surprise reintroduction is a classic reset trope.


 22. Flashback-as-Episode Framing (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Isaac’s 2018 backstory opens the episode to contextualize current motives.
    - Adds emotional weight but predictable structural move.


 23. Comedic Actor Cast Against Type (Medium Risk)
    - Example: Catherine O’Hara plays a dramatic role in contrast to concurrent comedy.
    - Works well but fits recent prestige-TV casting trends.


 24. Narrative Anchoring in a Single Object (Low Risk)
    - Example: Ellie leaving coffee beans on Joel’s grave.
    - Simple and poignant, though symbolic-object-as-emotional-anchor is very common.

This analysis takes into account all the categories from I. PROTAGONIST ARCHETYPES to XXI.

User:


I'm going to reiterate my initial request also for your reference:

I'm going to provide a list of story cliches that I'll then need you to compare overly-specified list of cliches from specific properties. You will compare each specific-property-cliche-list to the original list and either decide the specific cliches are close enough to the original, approved list of cliches -- if they are, you'll change them to the approved cliche; or you'll decide the specific-cliches are not close enough to the original cliches and you'll remove them from the specific list.

The goal is to apply the same list of cliches to a diverse range of story-properties I love to see which cliches I'm comfortable with -- so we need a shared list to compare cliches across these story-properties with the ability to make apples-to-apples comparisons.

Understood?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Yes, understood. Here's the approach I'll take:

Your Provided Cliché List (Approved Cliché List): I will reference the overarching list of cliches you've provided, which categorizes and defines various tropes across multiple narrative domains (e.g., protagonist archetypes, relationships, cinematography, etc.).

Specific-Property Cliché Lists: For each property you provide (such as The Last of Us: Season 2), I will analyze and extract the cliches or tropes from that list.

Comparison and Mapping: I will compare each cliche from the specific property list to the approved cliches list. If a cliche is close enough, I will adjust it to fit the approved cliche from your list. If the cliche is too different, I will remove it from the specific-property list.

Shared List Across Properties: The ultimate goal is to create a consistent and comparative framework for analyzing cliches in different properties, allowing us to evaluate and discuss them in a standardized way.

Now, let's proceed with comparing cliches from The Last of Us: Season 2 (or any other property) to your approved cliches list as needed.
