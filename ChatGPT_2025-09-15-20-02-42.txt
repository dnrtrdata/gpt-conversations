I want you to search and find varied examples of popular, highly-enjoyed "islands" that creators have crafted with UEFN for Fortnite (the newer the better) to gain a comprehensive understanding of both things that define a UEFN experience in terms of limitations and parameters for what's possible, and aspects of experiences players have had playing on these islands and moments they loved about that experience.

A. OnlyUp Fortnite – A 50-player vertical parkour gauntlet built in UEFN that tracks altitude and run-time, peaking at 113 933 concurrent players and still drawing 118 000 daily uniques after its May 3 2025 update, showing how high-skill movement maps thrive when creators mix Chapter 1 nostalgia with punishing resets. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  Community chatter highlights that the “OnlyUp trend” now dominates the Parkour tag, crowding out smaller obby creators, proving discoverability can become a self-reinforcing bottleneck. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

B. The Space Inside – Epic’s multi-room escape puzzle demonstrates single-player narrative pacing, custom cameras, and sequenced lighting; players praise its “Portal-like” progression but note its 10-minute length, illustrating how high-fidelity assets and Verse-controlled events stay within the 100 000-unit memory ceiling yet still feel cinematic. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

C. Forest Guardian – A lush one-player combat showcase featuring nanite rocks, Lumen lighting, and a dragon boss fight; Reddit threads cite its PS2-era foliage pop-in on old consoles, spotlighting cross-platform optimization pressure even when the island runs flawlessly on Series S. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

D. Deserted: Domination – An 8 v 8 oil-refinery control-point FPS that rotates weapon loadouts every round, proving UEFN can replicate tight arena pacing while sustaining 16-player networking; the design relies on prefab spawn rooms and device-driven scoreboards rather than custom Verse weapons, reflecting today’s gameplay constraints. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

E. Coachella Pillars – A branded 2-12-player rhythm-brawler with 30 music-powered tools and three rotating arenas suspended over the festival, blending reactive visualizers with knock-off mechanics; its success shows how licensors use UEFN to extend real-world events and how creators can script arena rotations without full HUD overhauls. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

F. ESPN Football Island – Disney’s payload-style “Touchdown Rush” features persistent progression and exclusive cosmetics, illustrating that Verse can now track per-player stats across sessions for sponsored experiences and that asymmetrical objective modes fit comfortably inside current replication limits. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

G. Rocket Racing Custom Tracks – Since Epic opened the Track Spline and Race Manager devices, community tracks like Neon City appear in weekly rotations; builders note that without official curation their maps earn little revenue, prompting calls for a Discover pipeline that graduates tested tracks into Ranked. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

H. Defining UEFN Parameters  
 1. Memory – Islands must keep every 100 m streaming cell under 100 000 memory units; exceeding the cap blocks publishing, though editors on PC may prototype beyond the limit. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
 2. Devices – Heavy use of Conditional Button, HUD, or Timer devices increases both memory and replication cost; creators drop frames on Switch when exceeding roughly 750 active devices. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
 3. Verse – Lacks direct APIs for common checks (e.g., IsHoldingPickaxe), forcing brute-force polling that inflates device count and network RPCs; forthcoming Persona Device will add dialog-driven AI NPCs and broaden Verse hooks. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
 4. Import Size – Custom assets plus textures must stay under a 100 MB build quota per publish iteration, or the Creator Portal rejects the upload (per current documentation footnotes). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
 5. Player Cap – Public islands cap at 100 concurrent players, though most high-fidelity showcases elect 1-50 slots to conserve replication bandwidth.

I. What Defines a Good UEFN Experience Today  
 • Clear genre hook (parkour tower, escape room, 8v8 FPS, concert arena).  
 • Tight Session Length (5-20 min) to maximize retention metrics Epic exposes in the new Data API. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
 • Visual punch balanced against console budgets (nanite when stationary, minimalist meshes when streaming fast).  
 • Discoverability loops—viral TikTok codes, YouTube showcases, or festival branding—to overcome the saturated Discover tab.

J. Moments Players Consistently Celebrate  
 • Reaching the final sky platform in OnlyUp after 30-plus falls, capturing victory screenshots with the altitude meter. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
 • Solving The Space Inside’s color-cipher door where lighting resets tease the answer, an example of Verse-controlled dynamic materials. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
 • Forest Guardian’s dragon lunge that knocks players off the cliff, leveraging sequencer-timed stunt cameras. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
 • Coachella Pillars’ finals where winners rocket skyward onto a virtual main stage as synced beat drops play, marrying event audio with impulse devices. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
 • Deserted: Domination’s overtime clutch when zone B flips at 99-99, echoing classic Call of Duty tension within Fortnite’s economy of prefabs. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
 • ESPN Football Island’s last-yard push where defenders build body blocks while commentators shout via triggered sound cues, showing brand crossover potential. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

K. Near-Term Evolution (announced June 2025)  
 • Scene Graph beta lets Verse traverse hierarchies, replacing many device chains.  
 • General Physics beta will open publishable destruction puzzles and sports sims.  
 • Avatar and Star Wars templates plus LEGO brick-by-brick will arrive over the next year, expanding genre breadth while keeping the same memory and player limits. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
