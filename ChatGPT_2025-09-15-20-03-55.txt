Gregory Alan Maddux (born April 14, 1966), also known as "Mad Dog" and "the Professor," is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily with the Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs. He won the 1995 World Series with the Braves over the Cleveland Indians. Maddux was the first pitcher in MLB history to win the Cy Young Award four consecutive years (1992–1995), matched by only one other pitcher, Randy Johnson. During those four seasons, Maddux had a 75–29 record with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA), while allowing fewer than one baserunner per inning.[1]

Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, Maddux is the only pitcher in MLB history to win at least 15 games for 17 straight seasons.[2][3] He also holds the record for most Gold Gloves by any player with 18, and most putouts by a pitcher with 546, including a tied live-ball-era record of 39 putouts in a season (1990, 1991, 1993). A superb control pitcher, Maddux won more games during the 1990s than any other pitcher and is 8th on the all-time career wins list with 355. Only Warren Spahn (363) recorded more career wins than Maddux since the start of the post-1920 live-ball era. Maddux also has the most wins among pitchers who made their debuts after World War II. He is one of only ten pitchers ever to achieve both 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts, and is the only pitcher to record more than 300 wins, more than 3,000 strikeouts, and fewer than 1,000 walks (exactly 999 walks overall).[4]
Since his retirement as a player, Maddux has also served as a special assistant to the general manager for both the Cubs and Texas Rangers. In 2014, he was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving 97.2% of the votes.[5] In 2012, writer Jason Lukehart coined the term "Maddux" to describe when a pitcher throws a complete game shutout in fewer than 100 pitches; Maddux holds the record for most times accomplishing this feat (13) since pitch counts began to be tracked in 1988. The runner-up for this accomplishment is Zane Smith with seven such games.
Early life
edit
Maddux was born in San Angelo, Texas, and spent much of his childhood in Madrid, Spain, where the United States Air Force stationed his father.[6] His father exposed him to baseball at an early age. Upon his return to Las Vegas, Nevada, Maddux and his brother Mike, who became a pro player himself, trained under the supervision of Ralph Meder, a former scout from the majors.[7] Meder preached the value of movement and location above velocity, and advised throwing softer when in a jam instead of harder. Maddux would later say, "I believed it. I don't know why. I just did."[8]
Though Meder died before Maddux graduated from Valley High School in Las Vegas in 1984, he instilled a firm foundation that would anchor Maddux's future career.[8] At Valley High, he was teammates on the school's baseball team with future Major League pitcher Steve Chitren and helped lead the school to a state championship as a junior in 1983.[9] While in Las Vegas, he played American Legion Baseball with Post 8. He was named the organization's Graduate of the Year in 1984.[10]
His brother, Mike, was drafted in 1982. When scouts went to observe the elder Maddux, their father, Dave, told them, "You will be back later for the little one."[11] Some baseball scouts were unimpressed by Maddux's skinny build, but Chicago Cubs scout Doug Mapson saw past the physique. Mapson wrote a glowing review that read in part, "I really believe this boy would be the number one player in the country if only he looked a bit more physical."[12]
Professional career
edit
Chicago Cubs (1986–1992)
edit
The Chicago Cubs selected Maddux in the second round of the 1984 Major League Baseball draft[13][14] and he chose to sign in lieu of honoring a commitment to play college baseball at the University of Arizona.[15] He made his major league debut on September 3, 1986, the conclusion of the September 2 game which had been postponed due to darkness (lights were not installed at Wrigley Field until 1988). At the time, Maddux was the youngest player in the majors. His first appearance in a major league game was as a pinch runner (for catcher Jody Davis) in the 17th inning against the Houston Astros. Maddux then pitched in the 18th inning, allowing a home run to Billy Hatcher and taking the loss. His first start, five days later, was a complete game win. In his fifth and final start of 1986, Maddux defeated his older brother, who was pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies, marking the first time rookie brothers had pitched against each other. Mike Maddux was well used to his younger brother's competitive spirit, saying of their youth, "If Greg couldn't win, he didn't want to play, plain and simple."[16]
In 1987, his first full season in the majors, Maddux struggled significantly. Entering his start on July 8 against the San Diego Padres, Maddux was warned that if he did not get the win in what was his eighteenth start of the season, he would be sent back to Triple-A. In the bottom of the third inning, Padres starter Eric Show hit Cubs star Andre Dawson in the face with a pitch and triggered a bench clearing brawl. In the home dugout, Maddux had made up his mind that he would retaliate when the Padres came to bat. However, since this would almost certainly result in his ejection from the game and an automatic no decision since the game was not official yet, Cubs ace Rick Sutcliffe tried to talk Maddux out of what he was planning by reminding him of his impending demotion. Sutcliffe recalled Maddux looking back at him with tears in his eyes, saying that he did not care; with two outs in the top of the fourth, Maddux got his revenge by hitting Padres catcher Benito Santiago. Although he was ejected, the Cubs kept Maddux on the roster for several weeks before sending him down; he was quickly recalled after going undefeated in three starts for the Iowa Cubs with an ERA of 0.98, but finished his initial season in Chicago with six wins against fourteen losses and an ERA above 5.00.
Maddux rebounded to make his first All-Star appearance in 1988, winning eighteen games, and then established himself as the Cubs' ace in 1989, winning 19 games, including a September game at Montreal's Olympic Stadium that clinched the Cubs' second-ever National League Eastern Division championship. Manager Don Zimmer tabbed him to start Game One of the National League Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed eight runs and was relieved after surrendering Will Clark's grand slam with two outs in the fourth. Maddux believed that just before the grand slam, when Maddux had a conversation with Zimmer, Clark watched, read Maddux's lips (Maddux said, "Fastball, high, inside), and so knew what pitch to expect. After that incident, Maddux always covered his mouth with his glove during conversations on the mound.[17] Maddux took a no-decision in Game Four; the Cubs ended up losing the NLCS four-games-to-one.

The 1992 Cy Young Award, awarded to Maddux
After consecutive 15-win seasons in 1990 and 1991, Maddux won 20 games in 1992, tied for the NL lead, and was voted his first National League Cy Young Award. Free agency was pending for Maddux, but contract talks with the Cubs became contentious and eventually ceased. Both Chicago general manager Larry Himes and Maddux's agent, Scott Boras, accused the other of failing to negotiate in good faith. The Cubs eventually decided to pursue other free agents, including José Guzmán, Dan Plesac, and Candy Maldonado. After seven seasons in Chicago, Maddux signed a five-year, $28 million deal with the Atlanta Braves.[18]
Atlanta Braves (1993–2003)
edit
Maddux made his debut with the Braves on April 5, 1993, as their opening day starter against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, beating his former teammates 1–0.[19] He finished the regular season with a 20–10 record, led the NL with a 2.36 ERA, and won his second straight Cy Young Award.[20][21] The Braves took their rotation of Maddux, 22-game winner Tom Glavine, 18-game winner Steve Avery, and 15-game winner John Smoltz to the postseason. Maddux won against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game Two of the NLCS, but with Atlanta trailing 3 games to 2, lost the decisive Game Six.

Maddux pitching for the Braves in 1994
During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Maddux posted an ERA of 1.56, the second-lowest since Bob Gibson's historic 1.12 in 1968, the last year of the elevated mound, and the lowest in the majors since Dwight Gooden's 1.53 in 1985. It pleased Maddux that his 1994 batting average (.222) was higher than his ERA.[22] Maddux also led the National League in wins (with 16) and innings pitched (202) in his third Cy Young-winning year. Maddux also finished 5th in National League Most Valuable Player voting in 1994.
In the 1995 season, Maddux was 19–2 and he posted the third-lowest ERA since Gibson's: 1.63. Maddux became the first pitcher to post back-to-back ERAs under 1.80 since Walter Johnson in 1918 (1.27) and 1919 (1.49). Maddux's 1.63 ERA came in a year when the overall league ERA was 4.23. Since the beginning of the live-ball era in 1920, there have only been five pitchers to have full-season ERAs under 1.65: Gibson and Luis Tiant in the anomalous 1968 season, Gooden in 1985, and Maddux, twice. Maddux's 19 wins led the National League, for the third time in four seasons.
On May 28, 1995, he beat the Astros, losing a no-hitter on an eighth-inning home run to Jeff Bagwell. It was the only nine-inning one-hitter of his career.[23] In June and July, Maddux threw 51 consecutive innings without issuing a walk. Maddux pitched effectively in all three of the Braves's postseason series, winning a game in each. His Game One victory in the 1995 World Series involved nine innings, two hits, no walks, and no earned runs with Orel Hershiser pitching for the Cleveland Indians. Maddux took the loss in Game Five, but the Atlanta Braves won their first World Series championship two days later. Following the 1995 season, Maddux won his fourth straight Cy Young Award, a major league record, and his second consecutive unanimous award. Maddux also finished third in that year's National League Most Valuable Player voting. The Atlanta Braves also made good on a pre-season promise to their pitching rotation, installing a putting green in the locker room at the newly built Turner Field following the World Series victory.
From 1996 to 1998, Maddux finished fifth, second, and fourth in the Cy Young voting. In August 1997, Maddux signed a $57.5-million, five-year contract extension that made him the highest-paid player in baseball.[18] In February 2003, he avoided arbitration by signing a one-year $14.75-million deal.[18] Maddux's production remained consistent: a 19–4 record in 1997, 18–9 in 1998, 19–9 in both 1999 and 2000, 17–11 in 2001, 16–6 in 2002, and 16–11 in 2003, his last season as a Brave. From 1993 to 1998, Maddux led the National League in ERA four times, and was second the other two seasons.
On July 22, 1997, Maddux threw a complete game with just 78 pitches (36 strikes, 20 batted balls, 13 balls, 5 hits, and 4 fouls) against the Cubs. Three weeks earlier, he had shut out the defending champion New York Yankees on 84 pitches, and five days before that he had beaten the Phillies with a 90-pitch complete game. Maddux allowed just 20 bases on balls in 1997, including six intentional walks.[24]
Maddux struck out 200+ batters for the only time in his career in 1998. He outdueled the Cubs' Kerry Wood to clinch the NLDS, but the Braves were eliminated in the next round. The Braves returned to the World Series in 1999. Maddux was the Game One starter, and took a 1–0 lead into the eighth inning before a Yankee rally cost him the game and eventually the series as the Braves were swept.
On June 14, 2000, Maddux made his 387th putout to break Jack Morris's career record.[22] In September 2000, he had a streak of 401⁄3 scoreless innings.[23] He pitched poorly in his one playoff start of 2000. In May 2001, Maddux became the first Braves pitcher since 1916 to throw two 1–0 shutouts in the same month. The first included a career-best 14 strikeouts.[23] In July and August of that year, Maddux pitched 721⁄3 consecutive innings without giving up a walk; that streak ended when he intentionally threw four balls to Steve Finley.[25] In 2002, he won his 13th straight Gold Glove Award, a NL record. Maddux tied Jim Kaat's career record of 16 Gold Gloves after the 2006 season.
Throughout most of his years with the Braves, in the tradition of other pitching greats such as Steve Carlton, Maddux often had his own personal catcher. At various times Maddux used Charlie O'Brien, Eddie Pérez, Paul Bako, and Henry Blanco, for the majority of his starts, though regular starter Javy López did sometimes catch Maddux in the postseason.
Maddux was the crown jewel in the much-vaunted Braves trio of Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, who pitched together for over a decade as the core of one of the best pitching staffs in the history of the game. The three were the linchpin of a team that won its division (the National League West in 1993 and the East from then on) every year that Maddux was on the team (1994 had no division champions). The three pitchers were frequently augmented by other strong starters such as Steve Avery, Kevin Millwood, Denny Neagle, and Russ Ortiz. In 1995, they pitched the Braves to a World Series title. In 29 postseason games with Atlanta, Maddux had a 2.81 ERA and a 1.19 WHIP, but just an 11–13 record.

Second stint with the Chicago Cubs (2004–2006)
edit
Maddux returned to the Cubs as a free agent prior to the 2004 season, when he signed with them on February 18, 2004.[26] Maddux got his first win on April 23 after losing 3 consecutive games at the beginning of the season. On August 7, Maddux defeated the San Francisco Giants, 8–4, to garner his 300th career victory. In April 2005, he beat Roger Clemens for his 306th win in the first National League matchup between 300-game winners in 113 years.[18] On July 26, 2005, after a three-hour rain delay, Maddux struck out Omar Vizquel to become the thirteenth member of the 3,000 strikeout club and only the ninth pitcher with both 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts, having reached both marks against the San Francisco Giants. Maddux finished as one of the four pitchers to top 3,000 strikeouts while having allowed fewer than 1,000 walks (he had 999). The other three pitchers who have accomplished this feat are Ferguson Jenkins, Curt Schilling, and Pedro Martínez.
Maddux's 13–15 record in 2005 was his first losing record since 1987, and snapped a string of seventeen consecutive seasons with 15 or more wins. (Cy Young had surpassed the 15-win total for 15 straight years; both Young and Maddux reached 13+ wins for 19 consecutive seasons. This is even more impressive considering that Cy Young pitched in an era with no more than 4 regular starters that would average more than 40+ games per season, whereas Maddux pitched in an era with a 5-man rotation when reaching 40 starts in a season was virtually unheard of.)
Los Angeles Dodgers (2006)
edit
Maddux's second stint with the Chicago Cubs lasted until mid-2006, when he was traded for the first time in his career, to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[27] At the time, the Dodgers were in the thick of a playoff race. In his first Dodger start, Maddux threw six no-hit innings before a rain delay interrupted his debut. In his next start, Maddux needed just 68 pitches to throw eight shutout innings. On August 30, 2006, he won his 330th career game, passing Steve Carlton to take sole possession of 10th on the all-time list. On September 30, 2006, Maddux pitched seven innings in San Francisco, allowing two runs and three hits in a 4–2 victory over the Giants, clinching a postseason spot for the Dodgers and notching another 15-win season. It was Maddux's 18th season among his league's Top 10 for wins, breaking a record he'd shared with Cy Young and Warren Spahn, who did it 17 times apiece. However, the Dodgers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Mets. Maddux started the third and final game, throwing an ineffective no-decision. Maddux was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding pitcher in MLB for 2006.[28]
San Diego Padres (2007–2008)
edit
 
Maddux pitching for the Padres
On December 5, 2006, Maddux agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with the San Diego Padres with a player option for the 2008 season, an option that Maddux later exercised at a reported $10 million.[29] Maddux earned his 338th victory in the game that Trevor Hoffman earned his milestone 500th save. On August 24, 2007, he won his 343rd game to take sole possession of ninth place on the all-time win list. He achieved another milestone with the same win, becoming the only pitcher in the major leagues to have 20 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins and placing him second on the list for most 10-win seasons, tied with Nolan Ryan and behind Don Sutton, who has 21. Also in 2007, Maddux reached 13 wins for the 20th consecutive season, passing Cy Young for that major league record. He finished the season with a career total 347 wins. Maddux won a record 17th Gold Glove award in 2007, surpassing the record held by Brooks Robinson. On May 10, 2008, Maddux won his 350th game. Also in 2008, he became the oldest pitcher to steal a base at 42, incidentally against the Braves.[30]
Second stint with the Los Angeles Dodgers (2008)
edit
Maddux was traded back to the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 19 for two players to be named later or cash considerations by the San Diego Padres.[31] His return to Los Angeles was unlike his debut, though, as he allowed 7 earned runs on 9 hits while taking a loss against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Maddux pitched his 5,000th career inning against the San Francisco Giants on September 19. On September 27, in his final start of the season, he won his 355th game, moving him ahead of Roger Clemens into 8th place in all-time wins. Maddux ranks tenth in career strikeouts with 3,371. His strikeout total is balanced against 999 walks. For the 2008 season, he posted an 8–13 record. His 1.4 walks per 9 innings pitched were the best in the majors.[32]
After the Dodgers won the National League West, Maddux was moved to the bullpen after manager Joe Torre decided to go with a three-man rotation. Maddux pitched three innings of relief during the series (which the Dodgers lost), allowing two runs.[33] Maddux received his 18th Gold Glove Award in November 2008, extending his own major league record.[34] In December, he announced his retirement.[35]
Post-playing career
edit
On January 11, 2010, Maddux was hired by the Chicago Cubs as an assistant to General Manager Jim Hendry. In his return to Chicago, his focus was on developing pitchers' styles and techniques throughout the organization, including minor league affiliates.[36] For the 2012 season Maddux left his position with the Cubs and joined the Texas Rangers organization, where his brother Mike was the pitching coach.
He was announced as the pitching coach for the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[37]
On February 2, 2016, he was hired by the Dodgers as a special assistant to the President of Baseball Operations, Andrew Friedman.[38]
On July 6, 2016, Maddux was hired as an assistant baseball coach for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. For 4 years, he served as the pitching coach. Greg's son, Chase, was a pitcher for the Rebels.[39]
On February 14, 2023, Maddux was hired as a special assistant for Spring Training by the Texas Rangers, joining his brother Mike Maddux, who became the team's new pitching coach.[40]
Pitching style
edit
Maddux relied on his command, composure, and guile to outwit hitters. Though his fastball touched 93 mph in his early years,[41] his velocity steadily declined throughout his career, and was never his principal focus as a pitcher. By the end of his career, his fastball averaged less than 86 mph.[42] Maddux was also noted for the late movement on his sinker (two-seam fastball), which, combined with his control, made him known as an excellent groundball pitcher.[43] While Maddux was not known for his strikeout totals, his strikeout totals have often been undersold because strikeout rate has often been measured per nine innings, rather than per batter faced.[44] Maddux alternated his two-seam fastball with an excellent circle changeup. Though these served as his primary pitches, he also threw a curveball and a cutter.[42][45]
Maddux was renowned for focusing on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, and then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply on the strength of his reputation.[46] In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike.[47] Maddux said of that pitch, "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for me when I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective."[48]
In addition, his propensity for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept his pitch counts low. On July 2, 1997, he won a game against the New York Yankees, for example, with the numbers "nine innings, three hits, no walks, eight strikeouts, one pickoff, one double play, 84 pitches ... [in] two hours and nine minutes".[49] Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux's pitching consistency, saying "It's almost like a guy lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches."[50] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, "This guy can throw a ball in a teacup."[51] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: "It seems like he's inside your mind with you. When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove."[52]
Maddux was also known for intensely studying hitters in preparation for his starts. He would often watch hitters take their warmup swings or read their body language to gauge their mentality.[47] Teammate Tom Glavine said, "I think the hitters think he can go back and recall every pitch he has ever thrown. That's not the case, but I think he's probably better at remembering things than most people are. He's definitely better in the course of the game at making adjustments on a hitter based on what he's seen, whether it's one swing or a guy's last at-bat."[53]
Finally, Maddux has been praised for his superior pitching mechanics, helping him avoid serious arm injuries throughout his lengthy career.[47][54] His only stint on the 15-day disabled list was in 2002, due to nerve inflammation on his back. One analyst of pitching mechanics wrote, "Maddux's sterling reputation for pitching mechanics is more than justified. He could repeat his delivery as well as any pitcher that I have ever seen, with consistent timing and positioning that persisted regardless of pitch type or pitch count, giving the impression that he was never fatigued."[55] Maddux was also a highly durable pitcher, leading the National League in innings pitched in five consecutive years. He pitched at least 194 innings for 21 consecutive seasons, and finished with the lowest BB/9 ratio in the National League nine times.
Pitching profile
edit

Greg Maddux's number 31 was retired by the Chicago Cubs in 2009.

Greg Maddux's number 31 was retired by the Atlanta Braves in 2009.
Maddux has been credited by many of his teammates with a superior ability to out-think his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez tells the story of Maddux, with an eight run lead, intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros' Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again—an inside fastball—which Maddux would then refuse to throw.[56] Maddux did face Bagwell in the playoffs that year, and struck him out with the bases loaded using three changeups.[57] On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, "Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly.[16] On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, "Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track."[58] The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.
 
Maddux in the dugout in 2008
Early in the 2000 season, Maddux was asked by sportswriter Bob Nightengale what had been the most memorable at-bat of his pitching career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him."[16]
Publicly, however, Maddux is dismissive of his reputation, saying, "People think I'm smart? You know what makes you smart? Locate your fastball down and away. That's what makes you smart. You talk to Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, or Tom Seaver. They'll all tell you the same thing. It's not your arm that makes you a great pitcher. It's that thing between both of your ears we call a brain."[59]
To this day, Maddux maintains Koufax, Gibson, and Seaver are the three best pitchers of the "live ball" era of baseball.[60] Informed by The Sporting News he had been voted best pitcher of the 1990s, he replied, "It [the award] could have gone to Glavine or Smoltz just as easily and each would have deserved it. They're both great pitchers."[59]
Maddux never walked more than 82 batters in any season of his career, averaging fewer than 2 walks per game. In 1997, Maddux allowed 20 walks in 232+ innings, or 0.77 per nine innings. In 2001, he set a National League record by going 721⁄3 innings without giving up a walk.[61]
Maddux's low walk totals also kept his pitch counts down, enabling him to go deeper into games. In 31 starts, Maddux threw nine innings with 100 or fewer pitches. Ten of those starts were under 90 pitches, including a 78-pitch complete game in July 1997,[62] the most efficient start by any pitcher since 1979. In recognition of this, the statistic describing a complete game shut-out thrown in less than 100 pitches was named after him. Maddux is the career leader for this stat, having pitched thirteen such games.[63]
He is also known to finish the game quickly. On June 27, 1998, he pitched a complete-game shutout against the Toronto Blue Jays in 102 pitches, but it was his fastest game in terms of time: 106 minutes, or 1 hour 46 minutes. This is including the customary 6th-inning timeout and mound visit.[64]
Awards
edit
In addition to his pitching skills, Maddux was an excellent fielding pitcher. He won 18 Gold Gloves, the record for any position. Of his 18 total awards, Maddux won 10 with the Braves, five with the Cubs, two with the Dodgers and one with the Padres. Maddux was also a good hitting pitcher, with a career .171 batting average, including four seasons batting .200 or better. He hit 5 home runs, with 84 RBIs.[65]
Maddux pitched in 13 Division Series contests, 17 League Championship games and five World Series games. He has a 3.27 ERA in 198 postseason innings, including an outstanding 2.09 ERA in 38+2⁄3 World Series innings. He was chosen for the National League All-Star team eight times.[3]
Maddux won 20 games only twice, in 1992 and 1993.[3] However, he won 19 games five times (including the 1995 season which was reduced to 144 games from the strike of 1994), 18 games twice, and 16 in the strike shortened 1994 season (which was reduced to 115 games).[3] He won four ERA titles (in 1993–1995 and 1998), and led the NL in shutouts five times.[3] He holds the major league record for seasons leading his league in games started (7).[66] He also holds the record for most seasons finishing in the top 10 in the league in wins (18).[67]
In his 2009 book, "The Annual Baseball Gold Mine" baseball statistics guru Bill James found Maddux to be far and away the most underrated player in baseball history. The methodology for this included the fact that though Maddux only won 20 games twice, he won 19 games five times. He also had only one season of 200 or more strikeouts but had seasons of 199, 198 and 197, respectively, which diminished his reputation as a strikeout pitcher. In addition to that James also argued that although he had 18 seasons of 200 or more innings pitched, he also had three seasons of 199+1⁄3, 198 and 194 innings pitched.
In 1999, Maddux ranked 39th on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking pitcher then active. He was also nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. However, when TSN updated their list in 2005, Maddux had fallen to number 51.
The Cubs retired jersey number 31 on May 3, 2009, in honor of Maddux and Ferguson Jenkins. The Atlanta Braves retired Maddux's number 31, on July 17, 2009.
"I get asked all the time was he the best pitcher I ever saw. Was he the smartest pitcher I ever saw? The most competitive I ever saw? The best teammate I ever saw? The answer is yes to all of those", said Braves manager Bobby Cox at the banquet to induct Maddux into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame at the Omni Hotel in Atlanta on July 17, 2009.[68]
On January 8, 2014, Maddux was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The pitcher later announced that he would not have a team logo on his plaque, citing his history with the Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs: "It's impossible for me to choose one of those teams ... as the fans of both clubs in each of those cities were so wonderful", Maddux said.[69]
Personal life
edit
Maddux was born on April 14, 1966, the same day as former Braves teammate David Justice, and shares a birthday with former teammate Steve Avery. He is married to Kathy; the couple has two children; a daughter, Paige Maddux (born December 9, 1993), and a son, Chase Maddux (born April 19, 1997).[70] They reside in Las Vegas.[71]
In 2002, in the episode "Take Me out of the Ballgame", of the TV series Do Over, the main character lost a baseball game to a young Greg Maddux, who was played by Shad Hart.
The song "Movement and Location" from the Punch Brothers album Who's Feeling Young Now? was written about Maddux.[72]

At 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 metres) tall, Johnson was the tallest player in MLB history when he entered the league, contributing to his extremely intimidating persona and pitching style. As a player, he was especially known for his overpowering fastball and devastating slider, a combination that remained effective throughout his lengthy career. While he initially struggled with control in his early seasons, Johnson subsequently established himself as one of the most dominant pitchers of his era, leading his league in strikeouts nine times, and in earned run average, winning percentage, and complete games four times each. Along with teammate, Curt Schilling, Johnson was one of two World Series Most Valuable Players in 2001; in the Series, Johnson won three games and led the Arizona Diamondbacks to a 2001 World Series victory over the New York Yankees in the fourth season of the team's existence. He won the pitching Triple Crown in 2002.
Johnson's 303 career victories are the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his 4,875 strikeouts place him second all time behind Nolan Ryan and first among left-handers. He recorded 300 strikeouts in a season six different times, a Major League record tied with Nolan Ryan. Johnson is a ten-time All-Star, won the Cy Young Award five times, and is one of only two pitchers (the other is Greg Maddux) to win the award in four consecutive seasons (1999–2002). Johnson won Cy Young Awards in both leagues. He is also one of five pitchers to pitch no-hitters in both leagues, and one of 25 pitchers in history to record a win against all 30 MLB franchises.
Johnson enjoyed a career longevity uncommon to pitchers, with his signature fastball-slider combination remaining effective well into his 40s. Four of his six 300-strikeout seasons occurred after his 35th birthday. On May 18, 2004, at 40 years old, he threw Major League Baseball's 17th perfect game, and remains the oldest pitcher to accomplish the feat. Johnson retired at the age of 46, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015 in his first year of eligibility. He is the first member of the Hall to be depicted in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque. Johnson's accomplishments and accolades have led to him being widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.[1]
Early life
edit
Johnson was born in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Walnut Creek, California, to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles "Bud" Johnson.[2] By the time he entered Livermore High School, he was a star in baseball and basketball. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a perfect game in his last high school start.
College career
edit
Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship to play baseball for the University of Southern California. While at USC, he also played two years of basketball.[3] He was a starter at USC (where he was a teammate of Mark McGwire) under coach Rod Dedeaux, but often exhibited control problems.[4]
Professional career
edit
Drafts and minor leagues
edit
After high school, Johnson was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 4th round of the 1982 MLB draft, but did not sign. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the second round of the 1985 Major League Baseball draft. In 1985, he pitched for the Jamestown Expos of the New York-Pennsylvania League.[5] In 1986, he pitched for the West Palm Beach Expos of the Florida State League. In 1987, he pitched for the Jacksonville Expos of the Southern League.[6] In 1988, he pitched for the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association.[7]
Montreal Expos (1988–1989)
edit
He made his major league debut on September 15, 1988, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, earning a 9–4 victory with a five-inning outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim was Orestes Destrade in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3–0 with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw him slip to an 0–4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7. On May 25, 1989, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners in a trade involving five pitchers that brought Mark Langston to Montreal. In 11 total games played with the Expos, he went 3–4 with a 4.69 ERA and one complete game in 55+2⁄3 innings with 51 strikeouts and 33 walks.
Seattle Mariners (1989–1998)
edit
1989–1992
edit
After joining the Mariners during the 1989 season, Johnson led the American League in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990–1992), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993.[8] In July 1991, facing the Milwaukee Brewers, the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.
His untapped talent was explosive: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out Wade Boggs three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with Nolan Ryan late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently.[9] In a September 27, 1992, game against the Texas Rangers, with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.[10] It was during the 1992 off-season when Johnson returned home for Christmas only to lose his father to an aortic aneurysm. His father's death was so devastating that he decided to quit baseball, only to have his mother convince him otherwise.[11]
1993
edit
Johnson broke out in 1993, posting a 19–8 record, 3.24 ERA and one save, his first of six 300-plus strikeout seasons (308), and he was also the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to reach 300 strikeouts in a single season. In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the Minnesota Twins' Chuck Knoblauch. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and Mike Timlin. Toronto general manager Pat Gillick had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager Woody Woodward and one for Rickey Henderson with Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call he said he would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized.[12] At the 1993 All-Star Game in Baltimore, Maryland, in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of Philadelphia Phillies first baseman John Kruk.[13] On October 3, Johnson entered the final game of the season as a defensive substitution, replacing Brian Turang in left field. This made him the tallest player to play the field in baseball history.[14]
1995
edit
After pitching well in the strike-shortened 1994 season, Johnson won the American League Cy Young Award in 1995 with an 18–2 record, 2.48 ERA and 294 strikeouts. His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind Johnny Allen, who had gone 15–1 for the Cleveland Indians in 1937. Johnson became the first regular starting pitcher in history to strike out more than a third of all batters faced. He also became the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the Cy Young Award, and the only one until Félix Hernández took home the honor in 2010. Johnson capped the Mariners' late-season comeback by pitching a three-hitter in the AL West's one-game playoff, crushing the California Angels' hopes with 12 strikeouts. Thus unable to start in the 5-game ALDS series against the Yankees until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2–0 series lead. He defeated the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.
When the series went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from a 2–0 deficit to win both games at the Kingdome, Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest. Entering a 4–4 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the 9th, 10th, and 11th innings. He allowed one run, struck out six, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle's dramatic comeback.
1996−1998
edit
Johnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in 1997 with a 20–4 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53–9, including a 16–0 streak that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8.[15][16]
Another colorful All-Star Game moment proceeded in the 1997 edition involving former Expos teammate Larry Walker, at that point with the Colorado Rockies.[17] When Johnson had started an interleague game versus the Rockies on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that "I faced Randy one time in spring training and he almost killed me."[18] In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters' box to stand right-handed for one pitch. He ended the at bat by drawing a walk.[19] The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and, of course, comparisons to the at bat with Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game.[20] In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson,[21] Walker batted .393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career,[22] nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at .199.[23] When the 1998 season began, Johnson was upset the Mariners would not offer him a contract extension, given his contract was expiring after the season.[24] Though the Mariners initially wanted to keep Johnson, turning down a trade offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers,[25] they fell out of contention, going 8–20 in June.[26] Minutes before the non-waiver trade deadline, on July 31, the Mariners traded Johnson to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers: Freddy García, Carlos Guillén, and John Halama.[26] Johnson was a Mariner for nearly 9 years, his longest tenure with one team.
Houston Astros (1998)
edit
In 11 regular-season starts with the Astros, Johnson posted a 10–1 record, a 1.28 ERA, and 116 strikeouts in 84+1⁄3 innings, and pitched four shutouts. Johnson finished 7th in the National League Cy Young Award voting, despite pitching only two months in the league, and helped Houston win their second straight National League Central division title. During the playoffs, however, the Astros lost the 1998 NLDS to the San Diego Padres, 3–1. Johnson started Games 1 and 4, both losses. He only gave up three earned runs combined in the two games, but received only one run in support (in Game 4).
Arizona Diamondbacks (1999–2004)
edit
Johnson agreed to a four-year contract, with an option for a fifth year, for $52.4 million, with the Arizona Diamondbacks, a second-year franchise.[27] Johnson led the team to the playoffs that year on the strength of a 17–9 record and 2.48 ERA with 364 strikeouts, leading the majors in innings, complete games, and strikeouts. Johnson won the 1999 NL Cy Young Award and Warren Spahn Award as the best left-handed pitcher in MLB.[28] Johnson became the third pitcher in history, after Gaylord Perry and Pedro Martínez, to win the Cy Young Award in both the American and National Leagues; Martínez won the AL Cy Young in the same season that Johnson won its NL counterpart. Johnson finished 2000 with 19 wins, 347 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA, and won his second consecutive NL Cy Young Award[8] and Warren Spahn Award.[29] The Diamondbacks acquired Curt Schilling from the Philadelphia Phillies in July 2000, and the two aces anchored the Diamondbacks rotation.[30]
In the fourth year of the franchise's existence, Johnson and Schilling carried the Arizona Diamondbacks to their first World Series appearance and victory in 2001 against the New York Yankees. Johnson and Schilling shared the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the Babe Ruth Award,[31] and were named Sports Illustrated magazine's 2001 "Sportsmen of the Year." For the first of two consecutive seasons, Johnson and Schilling finished 1–2 in the Cy Young balloting.[32] Johnson also won his third consecutive Warren Spahn Award.[33] Johnson's performance was particularly dominating, striking out 11 in a 3-hit shutout in Game 2, pitching seven innings for the victory in Game 6 and then coming on in relief the following day to pick up the win in Game 7. Of Arizona's eleven post-season wins in 2001, Johnson had five. He is also the last pitcher to win 3 games in a single World Series. Johnson's Game 7 relief appearance was his second of the 2001 season; on July 19, a game against the Padres was delayed by two electrical explosions in Qualcomm Stadium. When the game resumed the following day, Johnson stepped in as the new pitcher and racked up 16 strikeouts in seven innings, technically setting the record for the most strikeouts in a relief stint.[34]
 
In 2001, Johnson struck a bird with a pitched ball, resulting in what ABC News described as a "sea of feathers."[35]
In a freak accident on March 24, 2001, at Tucson Electric Park, during the 7th inning of a spring training game against the San Francisco Giants, Johnson threw a fastball to Calvin Murray that struck and killed a dove. The ball was ruled dead, and it was ruled "no pitch."[36] The event was not unique in baseball history, but it became one of Johnson's most-remembered baseball moments;[37] a news story 15 years later remarked, "the event remains iconic, and the Big Unit says he gets asked about the incident nearly as much as he does about winning the World Series later that year with the Arizona Diamondbacks."[38]
Johnson struck out 20 batters in a game on May 8, 2001, against the Cincinnati Reds.[39] Johnson recorded all 20 strikeouts in the first nine innings and was replaced before the start of the tenth, but because the game went into extra innings, he is ineligible to share the nine-inning game strikeout record. On August 23, 2001, Johnson struck out three batters on nine pitches in the 6th inning of a 5–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the 30th pitcher in major league history to pitch an immaculate inning. Johnson's 2001 season was the 2nd time in MLB history where a starting pitcher had more than twice as many strikeouts in a season (372) as hits allowed (181) (first accomplished by Pedro Martinez in the 2000 season with 284 strikeouts and 128 hits and later also accomplished by Max Scherzer in 2017, and both Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander in 2019). He also became the second pitcher to strike out 300 more batters than he walked, walking 71 batters against 372 strikeouts (first accomplished by Sandy Koufax who struck out 382 batters against 71 walks in 1965).
In 2002, Johnson won the pitching Triple Crown, leading the NL in wins, ERA, and strikeouts, and was voted his fourth consecutive Cy Young and Warren Spahn Awards.[40] It was Johnson's fourth consecutive 300-strikeout season with the Diamondbacks, and fifth consecutive overall, extending his own MLB record from the previous season in which he set the record for the most consecutive seasons with 300 or more strikeouts in a season by a pitcher.[41] He also became the first pitcher in baseball history to post a 24–5 record.[42]
Johnson spent the majority of the 2003 season on the disabled list and was ineffective in the few injury-hampered starts he did make.[43] He hit the only home run of his career on September 19, 2003, against the Milwaukee Brewers.[44] Johnson was a .125 hitter over 625 career at-bats.[8]
Perfect game
edit
Main article: Randy Johnson's perfect game
On May 18, 2004, Johnson pitched the 17th perfect game in MLB history. At 40 years of age, he was the oldest pitcher to accomplish this feat. Johnson had 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2–0 victory against the Atlanta Braves. The perfect game made him the fifth pitcher in Major League history (after Cy Young, Jim Bunning, Nolan Ryan, and Hideo Nomo) to pitch a no-hitter in both leagues. He also became the fifth pitcher in Major League history to throw both a no-hitter and a perfect game in his career (after Young, Bunning, Addie Joss, and Sandy Koufax; since Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Roy Halladay have joined this group).
Johnson struck out Jeff Cirillo of the San Diego Padres on June 29, 2004, to become only the fourth MLB player to reach 4,000 strikeouts in a career.[45]
He finished the 2004 season with a 16–14 record, though his poor record was partially due to a lack of run support as his ERA that year was 2.60. Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290) and finished second to Roger Clemens for the Cy Young Award. In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13–2. As his team only won 51 games that year, his ratio of winning 31.3% of his team's games was the highest for any starting pitcher since Steve Carlton in 1972 (who won 27 of the Phillies' 59 wins for an all-time record ratio of 45.8%).
New York Yankees (2005–2006)
edit
 
Johnson with the Yankees
The Diamondbacks traded Johnson to the New York Yankees for Javier Vázquez, Brad Halsey, Dioner Navarro, and cash in January 2005.[46] Johnson pitched Opening Day for the Yankees on April 3, 2005, against the Boston Red Sox. Johnson was inconsistent through 2005, allowing 32 home runs; however, he regained his dominance in late 2005. He was 5–0 against the Yankees' division rival Red Sox and finished the season 17–8 with a 3.79 ERA, and was second in the AL with 211 strikeouts.
In 2005, The Sporting News published an update of their 1999 book Baseball's 100 Greatest Players. Johnson did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher and his 2001 World Championship season taken into account, he was ranked at Number 60.[47]
Johnson was a disappointment in Game 3 of the 2005 Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs in 3 innings. He avoided being charged with the loss when the Yankees rallied, but eventually lost. In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance with 4 1/3 scoreless innings after Mike Mussina gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5–2 lead, but the Yankees were unable to come back in the series.
After an inconclusive year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17–11 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with only 172 strikeouts. It was revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure caused him to miss his last start of 2006. After being given epidural anesthesia and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS; however, he gave up 5 runs in 52⁄3 innings and being saddled with the loss.
Second stint with the Arizona Diamondbacks (2007–2008)
edit
 
Johnson pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
In January 2007, the Yankees traded Johnson back to the Diamondbacks, almost two years to the day that Arizona had traded him to New York, for a package of Luis Vizcaíno, Alberto González, Steven Jackson, and Ross Ohlendorf.[8] The Yankees' decision to trade Johnson was primarily based on a pre-season conversation he had with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman about the importance of being closer to his family in Phoenix after the death of his brother.[48]
Johnson missed most of April, rehabilitating his injured back before returning on April 24, 2007. Johnson allowed six runs in 5 innings and took the loss, but struck out seven. He returned to form, and by his tenth start of the season was among the NL's top ten strikeout pitchers. But on July 3, his surgically repaired disc from the previous season was reinjured. Johnson had season-ending surgery on the same disc, this time removing it completely. Reporting that the procedure went "a little better than expected", Arizona hoped that Johnson would be ready for the 2008 season.[49]
Johnson made his season debut on April 14, 2008, against the San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park eight months following his back surgery. On June 3, 2008, Johnson struck out Mike Cameron of the Milwaukee Brewers for career strikeout number 4,673. With this strikeout Johnson surpassed Roger Clemens for the number two spot on the all-time strikeout leaders list.[50] Johnson struck out 8 in the game but could not get the win as the Diamondbacks lost 7–1.
Johnson got his 4,700th career strikeout on July 6, 2008.[51] On July 27, 2008, Fred Lewis became the first left-handed batter to get four hits against Johnson in a game.[52] In the first at-bat in this game, a fog horn went off as Johnson was releasing his pitch, causing him to throw an eephus pitch which fell for a strike.[52][53] He finished the season with an 11–10 record and an ERA of 3.91, recording his 100th career complete game in a 2–1 victory over the Colorado Rockies.[54]
San Francisco Giants (2009)
edit
 
Johnson with the Giants in 2009
On December 26, 2008, Johnson signed a one-year deal with his hometown San Francisco Giants for a reported $8 million, with a possible $2.5 million in performance bonuses and another $2.5 million in award bonuses.[55][56] Johnson became the 24th pitcher to reach 300 wins, beating the Washington Nationals (the team that he first played for when they were known as the Montreal Expos) on June 4 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.[57] He became the seventh left-handed pitcher to achieve the 300-win milestone and the fifth pitcher in the last 50 years to get his 299th and 300th win in consecutive starts, joining Warren Spahn, Steve Carlton, Gaylord Perry, and Tom Seaver. Johnson was placed on the 60-day disabled list with a torn rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder on July 28, 2009.[58] Johnson was activated by the Giants on September 16, 2009, and assigned to the Giants bullpen.[59] On September 19, 2009, Johnson made his first relief appearance in 4 years, facing the Los Angeles Dodgers for 3 batters.[60] At age 46, he was at the time the second oldest player in Major League Baseball, trailing only former Mariners teammate Jamie Moyer.[61]
Retirement
edit
 
Randy Johnson's number 51 was retired by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2015.
On January 5, 2010, he announced his retirement from professional baseball.[62] The Mariners invited Johnson to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Seattle Mariners home opener at Safeco Field on April 12, 2010,[63] and inducted Johnson into the Mariners Hall of Fame on January 17, 2012.[64] The Diamondbacks invited Johnson and former teammate Curt Schilling to both throw out the ceremonial first pitches for the Arizona Diamondbacks' recognition of the 10th anniversary of the 2001 World Series team that defeated the New York Yankees.[65]
Johnson was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2015.[66] The Diamondbacks retired his number on August 8, 2015.[67] At the retirement ceremony, Johnson was presented with a replica of the drum set used by Neil Peart, drummer for the Canadian band Rush, during their 30th anniversary tour.[68]
Johnson has participated in over 40 trips with the United Service Organizations. He also supports initiatives to fight homelessness. In recognition of all his charitable efforts, he was the Hall of Fame recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award in 2019.[69]
In January 2015, Johnson was named a Special Assistant to the team president of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Derrick Hall.
In 2020, The Athletic ranked Johnson at number 28 on its "Baseball 100" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.[70] In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, The Sporting News named Johnson on their "Phoenix Mount Rushmore of Sports", along with Arizona Cardinals football player Larry Fitzgerald, Phoenix Suns basketball player Steve Nash, Phoenix Mercury basketball player Diana Taurasi.[71]
On June 2, 2025, the Seattle Mariners announced that the franchise will retire Johnson's number for their forthcoming 2026 season. This will be the fifth number retired by the franchise.[72]
Photography career
edit
Since retiring from baseball, Johnson has pursued a second career as a photographer. He had studied photojournalism at the University of Southern California, and photography remained a passion. He has done photography work for NFL games, a tour of the rock band Rush, and has done wildlife photography.[73][74]
Pitching style
edit
In the prime of his career, Johnson's fastball was clocked as high as 102 mph (164 km/h), with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm).[75] His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late break; hitters often believed they were thrown a fastball until the ball broke just before it crossed home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot.[76] Johnson dubbed his slider "Mr. Snappy".[77] In later years, his fastball declined to the 96 mph (154 km/h) range and his slider clocked at around 87 mph (140 km/h). Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like a change-up, and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs.[78] In a June 27, 2012, appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. "Honestly, Randy Johnson when he was good. It's hopeless. It's like a hopeless feeling. The first time you face him you feel like he's going to hit you right in the back of the neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going to hit you in the back of the neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike and you just have to trust it's going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn't lose one out there and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek."[79]

Personal life
edit
Johnson has four children with his wife Lisa: Sammy (born 1994), Tanner (born 1996), Willow (born 1998), and Alexandria (born 1999). He also has a daughter from a previous relationship with Laurel Roszell named Heather Renee Roszell (born 1989).[86] He is a resident of Paradise Valley, Arizona.[87][88]
"Big Unit" nickname
edit
During batting practice in 1988, the 6-foot-10-inch (2.08 m) Johnson, then with the Montreal Expos, collided head-first with outfielder Tim Raines, prompting his teammate to exclaim, "Damn! You're a big unit!"[89] The nickname stuck.
Throughout much of his career, Johnson held the title of tallest player in MLB history. Former pitchers Eric Hillman, Andrew Sisco, Andrew Brackman, and Chris Young have also been measured at 6'10". After his retirement, the title of tallest player was held by Johnson's former Diamondback teammate Jon Rauch, a relief pitcher who is 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m).[90]
Acting career
edit
Johnson guest-starred in The Simpsons episode "Bart Has Two Mommies", which aired on March 19, 2006. Johnson appeared in the movie Little Big League, playing himself.[91]
Johnson appeared in a Just for Men commercial where he had a grey beard and his neighbors told him "Your beard is weird." Johnson also appeared in a Right Guard commercial where he fired dodgeballs at Kyle Brandt, who represented odor. Johnson also appeared in several commercials for Nike in 1998. The spots comedically portrayed him taking batting practice (swinging ineptly at balls from a pitching machine) in his hope that he would break Roger Maris's then-single-season record for home runs. He made a cameo appearance in a commercial for MLB 2K9 with teammate Tim Lincecum. Johnson made an appearance in a GEICO insurance commercial.[92] In 2012, he appeared in a TV ad for Pepsi Max.[93] In 2016, Johnson appeared in a TV ad for the Mini Clubman.[94]
In 2022, Johnson appeared with his former teammates Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez as well as Hall of Famer David Ortiz in a commercial for the streaming service DirecTV Stream parodying Ghostbusters, as the group (titled Goatbusters) battles a giant Mr. Redlegs destroying a baseball stadium.[95]
Johnson has been featured as a playable character in various Backyard Baseball games.
Johnson appeared in the episode "Control" on Franklin & Bash as himself.[96]

The Royals selected Greinke in the first round with the sixth pick of the 2002 MLB draft, after he won the Gatorade National Player of the Year Award as a high school senior. After playing in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2004. His career was nearly derailed by his battles with depression and anxiety in 2005 and 2006, and he missed most of the 2006 season. He returned in 2007 as a relief pitcher, before rejoining the starting rotation in 2008 and developing into one of the top pitchers in the game. In 2009, he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game, led the major leagues in earned run average (ERA), and won the American League Cy Young Award.
Following his first stint with the Royals, Greinke played for the Brewers, Angels, Dodgers, Diamondbacks, and Astros across 2011 to 2021. During this time, he won six consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 2014 to 2019, and led MLB in ERA for a second time in 2015 with the Dodgers. In 2022 he returned to the Royals.
A dedicated competitor often described as unique in his talent and demeanor by teammates, Greinke was a six-time All-Star, six-time Gold Glove Award winner, two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, two-time earned run average leader, and an American League Cy Young Award recipient.[3]
Greinke is one of only five pitchers (Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux, and Roger Clemens) to strike out 1,000 different batters, with his 1,000th strikeout coming against Joey Wiemer on May 14, 2023.[4]
Early life
edit
Greinke was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of teachers Donald and Marsha Greinke. He is of German descent, and was active in Little League and also excelled in tennis and golf tournaments as a youth.[5][6] As a teenager, Greinke helped lead his team to the Senior League World Series title in 1999. He played shortstop for the team, and his coach estimated that he hit close to .700 in the tournament.[7]
Greinke was primarily a shortstop when he started playing baseball at Apopka High School. He hit over .400 with 31 home runs in his high school career.[8] He worked as a relief pitcher as a sophomore and junior, before becoming a starting pitcher as a senior.[8] During his senior season, in 2002, Greinke compiled a 9–2 win–loss record, a 0.55 earned run average (ERA), and 118 strikeouts in 63 innings. He also held opposing batters to a .107 average.[8] He led his team to a 32–2 record and their third straight district title, and was selected as Gatorade National Player of the Year.[9] After the high school season ended, he played in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association All-Star Classic and impressed pro scouts with his performance against some of the best hitters in the country.[10]
Professional career
edit
Draft and minor leagues
edit
The Kansas City Royals selected Greinke in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft.[11] They felt Greinke was a polished player who could move quickly through their system.[8] Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University[12][13] to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.[14]
Greinke pitched in six minor league games (five starts) for the Royals farm teams in 2002: three games for the Gulf Coast Royals, two for the Low-A Spokane Indians, and two innings for the High-A Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. He had a 3.97 ERA in 11+1⁄3 innings.[15]
In 2003, Greinke opened the season with Wilmington, where he was 11–1 with a 1.14 ERA in 14 starts.[16] Those numbers earned spots on both the Carolina League mid-season[17] and post-season all-star teams as well as Carolina League Pitcher of the Year award.[18] The Blue Rocks' manager, Billy Gardner, Jr., remarked that Greinke was "the best pitcher I've ever seen at this level of the minor leagues."[19] He was promoted in July to the Double-A Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League,[19] where in nine starts he was 4–3 with a 3.23 ERA.[20] He had a couple of games where he struggled at Wichita and gave up a lot of runs. However, he bounced back and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the season.[19]
Greinke was named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year for 2003.[21] He was promoted by the Royals in 2004 to the Triple-A Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League, where he was 1–1 with a 2.51 ERA in six starts.[22]
Kansas City Royals (2004–2010)
edit
 
Greinke pitching for the Kansas City Royals in 2009
Greinke was called up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, allowing two earned runs in five innings. At 20 years old, he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.[23][24]
Greinke recorded his first career win on June 8, when he pitched seven scoreless innings against the Montreal Expos.[25] In 24 starts, Greinke finished the 2004 season with an 8–11 record and a 3.97 ERA.[26]
On June 10, 2005, Greinke recorded his first major league hit; a home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Russ Ortiz in a 12–11 loss. However, he also allowed 15 hits and 11 runs in that game. The 15 hits allowed tied a franchise record, while the 11 runs set a club record.[27] In 2005, Greinke led the American League in losses, finishing with a 5–17 record and a 5.80 ERA in 33 starts.[26]
Greinke was sometimes quiet and awkward in the clubhouse. To alleviate some of his anxiety and solitude, the Royals made arrangements for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett.[28] Still, by the 2005–2006 off-season he nearly quit baseball; Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he did not expect to return.[29] He left spring training for personal reasons in late February 2006.[30] It was later revealed that he was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder.[31] He reported back to the Royals' spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, on April 17, where he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely.[32] He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication.[28] Greinke only made three appearances out of the bullpen in 2006, and finished the year 1–0 with a 4.26 ERA.[26]
In 2007, Greinke returned to the Royals rotation at the start of the season, but was assigned to the bullpen in early May.[33] In 52 appearances (14 starts), Greinke finished 2007 with a 7–7 record, one save, and a 3.69 ERA.[26]
Greinke returned to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13–10 record along with 183 strikeouts.[26] His 3.47 ERA was the best by a full-time Royals starter in 11 years.[34] On January 26, 2009, he agreed to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38 million.[34]
After ending the 2008 season with 15 scoreless innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not allowing a run in his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run.[35] Greinke was named American League (AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors.[36] On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game.[37] On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.[38]
Greinke's record for the 2009 season was 16–8, and he posted an ERA of 2.16, the lowest in MLB.[26] On October 21, he was named American League Pitcher of the Year by Sporting News.[39] On October 28, Greinke was awarded the MLBPA Players Choice AL Pitcher of the Year. On November 17, 2009, he won the AL Cy Young Award.[40] Greinke credited some of his performance to his use of "modern pitching metrics" — statistics on team defense and defense independent pitching statistics — to calibrate his own approach to pitching. Greinke specifically mentioned FIP (fielding independent pitching), an indicator developed by sabermetrician Tom Tango, as his favorite statistic. "That's pretty much how I pitch, to try to keep my FIP as low as possible.[41]
Despite a stellar 2009 season, his performance in 2010 began to regress as he finished the year 10–14 with a 4.17 ERA and 181 strikeouts.[26]
Milwaukee Brewers (2011–2012)

On December 17, 2010, Greinke reportedly asked the Royals to trade him, claiming that he was not motivated to play for a rebuilding team.[42] The Royals were unlikely to afford signing Greinke to a long-term deal once he became a free agent, so they agreed to trade him for some quality prospects.[43] On December 19, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with Yuniesky Betancourt and $2 million for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. He was given the number 13, instead of his preferred number 23, due to number 23 already being issued to Rickie Weeks.[44] Greinke would later admit that he handled the trade request poorly, saying that he was "pretty rude" on the way out,[45] but the deal worked out well for both teams.[46]
In February 2011, before reporting to his first spring training with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball.[47] He started the 2011 season on the disabled list.[48]
 
Greinke with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2011
Greinke made his Brewers debut in the second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011.[49] Despite missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke finished second on the team in wins with a 16–6 record in 28 starts. He also had a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts (seventh in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched while surrendering just 45 walks.[26][50] Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost percentage (.727) and sixth in wins.[50] He went a perfect 11–0 in his starts at Miller Park, the Brewers' home stadium.[51]
On April 7, 2012, the Brewers defeated the Cardinals 6–0 in Greinke's first start of the season after he pitched seven scoreless innings while giving up four hits and striking out seven.[52]
In an oddity, Greinke became the first pitcher to start three straight games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just four pitches for angrily throwing the ball into the ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning.[53] The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after five innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day.[54]
To begin 2012, Greinke made 21 starts with the Brewers and had a 9–3 record, 120 strikeouts, and a 3.44 ERA.[55]
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2012)
edit
Despite his success with the Brewers, the team was struggling and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27, 2012, in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked that it was one of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was fond of Greinke.[55]
Greinke made his first start for the Angels on July 29.[56] After a stretch of four unproductive starts from August 3–19 (1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs — all of them wins. In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in 28+1⁄3 innings.[56]
Greinke became the first pitcher since 1920 to record 13 strikeouts in five innings or less in a game against the Seattle Mariners on September 25. He then combined with four other Angels pitchers to tie an American League record by striking out 20 batters in a nine-inning game.[57] He finished his time with the Angels with a 6–2 record and a 3.53 ERA in 13 starts.[56] Overall in 2012, combined with both teams, Greinke made 34 starts with a 15–5 record, 200 strikeouts, and a 3.48 ERA.[26]
Los Angeles Dodgers (2013–2015)
edit
Greinke agreed to a six-year free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher at the time it was signed.[58] It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year, $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners.[59] Greinke later explained that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.[60]
On April 11, 2013, Greinke fractured his left collarbone in a brawl with Carlos Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin was hit by an inside pitch and charged the mound.[61] He was placed on the disabled list and it was revealed that he would require surgery,[62] which was performed on April 13.[63] It was estimated that he would miss eight weeks of the season. However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.[64] He returned to the Dodgers on May 15, tossing 5+1⁄3 innings of one-run ball and striking out four to earn the win.[65]
On June 11, 2013, Greinke was hit in the head and neck area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not participate in the brawl, he was unaffected.[66]
 
Greinke with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2013
Greinke picked up his 100th career win on August 5, 2013, against the St. Louis Cardinals.[67] He was 5–0 with a 1.23 ERA during the month of August and was selected as National League Pitcher of the Month.[68] Greinke finished his first season with the Dodgers with a 15–4 record and 2.63 ERA in 28 starts. He also batted .328, the highest batting average for a Dodgers pitcher since Orel Hershiser in the 1993 season.[69] He was awarded with the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the National League.[70]
Greinke began the 2014 season by setting an MLB record with 22 straight starts (dating back to July 2013) where he allowed two or fewer earned runs.[71][72] He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game[73] and finished the season with a 17–8 record and a 2.71 ERA in 32 starts, the highest win total in his career.[26] He won the Gold Glove Award as the best fielding pitcher in the National League.[74]
When Justin Upton of the San Diego Padres homered against Greinke in the eighth inning on June 13, 2015, it was the last run he surrendered until the All-Star break.[75] Greinke was then selected to the All-Star Game, his second straight appearance,[76] and chosen to be the starting pitcher for the National League squad. At that point in the season, Greinke carried a major league-leading 1.48 ERA with a 7–2 record.[77] After Greinke retired 28 consecutive batters over a span of two starts, Nationals outfielder Michael Taylor ended the streak in the third inning on July 19.[78]
Greinke's recorded a scoreless innings streak which reached 45 innings; it started on June 18 and ended on July 26 start against the New York Mets at Citi Field and is the sixth-longest streak in MLB history. He shared the NL Player of the Week honors with his teammate Clayton Kershaw for July 13–19.[79] Greinke finished the 2015 season with a 19–3 record, 200 strikeouts, and a major-league-best 1.66 ERA.[80] His ERA was the second lowest in Dodgers history behind Rube Marquard in 1916, and his ERA+ (225) and major-league-leading WHIP (0.844) were the best in franchise history.[81][82] He led all major league pitchers in left on base percentage, stranding 86.5% of base runners.[83]
Greinke pitched in two games in the 2015 National League Division Series against the New York Mets. He allowed five runs in 13+2⁄3 innings and took the loss in the deciding fifth game in the series.[84] At the conclusion of the series, it was announced that he would opt out of the last three years of his contract with the Dodgers and become a free agent.[85] He officially opted out on November 3.[86]
After the season, Greinke was selected as the Outstanding National League Pitcher at the Players Choice Awards,[87] and won his second Gold Glove Award.[88] Greinke finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting to Jake Arrieta.[89]
Arizona Diamondbacks (2016–2019)
edit
 
Greinke with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2016
On December 8, 2015, Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[90] Greinke started on Opening Day 2016 at Chase Field against the Colorado Rockies; he gave up seven runs in four innings, including two home runs to rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who was making his MLB debut. The Diamondbacks lost the game 10–5.[91] In his second start, on April 9, Greinke matched up against Kyle Hendricks and the Chicago Cubs. He allowed three runs in the first inning, and struggled through the rest of his outing. The Diamondbacks lost the game 4–2.[92] Greinke got his first win as a Diamondback on April 19, 2016, against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just one run in over six innings of work.[93][94] On July 3, 2016, Greinke was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left oblique strain.[95][96] On August 24, 2016, he recorded his 2000th career strikeout in the Diamondbacks' 10–9 win over Atlanta Braves.[97] Greinke made 26 starts in his first season with Arizona, and he had a 13–7 record and a 4.37 ERA in 158+2⁄3 innings.[26] He won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award after the season.[98]
In 2017, Greinke was selected to the NL All-Star team, his fourth All-Star selection. At the time of his selection he was 10–4 with a 3.05 ERA in 109+1⁄3 innings, 128 strikeouts (10.21 strikeouts per nine innings), WHIP of 1.02 and a .219 opponents batting average.[99] On September 16 versus the San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park, he completed eight shutout innings with two hits allowed and eight strikeouts as Arizona won, 2−0. His game score of 90 was the second-best of his career, and he also hit two doubles at the plate.[100] In 32 starts in 2017, Greinke finished with a 17–7 record, 215 strikeouts, and a 3.20 ERA in 202+1⁄3 innings.[26] The Diamondbacks finished with a 93–69 record and clinched a Wild Card spot, but lost to the Dodgers in the Division Series. Greinke won his fourth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award after the 2017 season. He also finished fourth in the Cy Young voting behind Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and Stephen Strasburg.[101]
Greinke was once again named an All-Star in 2018.[102] He finished the season with a 15–11 record and a 3.21 ERA in 33 starts.[103] Following the season, he won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award.[104]
On April 2, 2019, Greinke hit two home runs and struck out 10 as the Diamondbacks won 8–5 against the Padres.[105] In 2019 with Arizona before he was traded, he was 10–4 with a 2.90 ERA.[26]
Greinke batted .271 with three home runs and 8 RBI with the Diamondbacks in 2019, earning him his second career Silver Slugger Award.[106]
Houston Astros (2019–2021)
edit
On July 31, 2019, the Diamondbacks traded Greinke to the Houston Astros with cash considerations for four minor league prospects: Corbin Martin, J. B. Bukauskas, Seth Beer, and Joshua Rojas.[107] The Diamondbacks also agreed to pay $24 million of Greinke's remaining $77 million salary.
On September 14, 2019, against the Kansas City Royals, Greinke became the 19th pitcher in MLB history to win a game against all 30 MLB franchises.[108] In 2019 with the Astros, he was 8–1 with a 3.02 ERA.[26] Between the two teams, in 2019 he was 18–5 with a 2.93 ERA, as in 208.2 innings (sixth in the majors) over 33 starts he walked only 30 batters (1.3 walks per nine innings, the best ratio of his career and third-best in the major leagues), and had a WHIP of 0.982 (fifth-best in the major leagues).[26] At the plate, he batted .280/.308/.580 with three home runs and 8 RBI in 50 at bats.[26] Greinke started Games 3 and 7 of the 2019 World Series for Houston. Greinke allowed two runs on two hits in 6+1⁄3 innings in his Game 7 start.[109][110] He was pulled by manager A. J. Hinch in the seventh inning after surrendering a one-out home run to Anthony Rendon, followed by a walk to Juan Soto, with the Astros leading 2–1.[109][110] He was replaced by Will Harris, who allowed a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick. The Astros lost the game 6–2, prompting questions by members of the media about Hinch's decision to pull Greinke.[109][110][111]
In 2020, Greinke produced a 3–3 record with a 4.03 ERA in 12 starts spanning 67 innings, and was second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.209) and fourth in home runs per nine innings (0.806).[26][112]
On April 1, 2021, Greinke earned his first Opening Day win and 209th win overall as the Astros defeated the Oakland Athletics, 8–1, at the Oakland Coliseum. He pitched six scoreless innings, the 65th time his career he has produced at least six scoreless innings.[113] In the May 25 contest versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, he reached 3,000 career innings, the 135th pitcher in major league history to achieve this milestone.[114] On June 4, 2021, Greinke threw a complete game for the first time since April 19, 2017. He allowed six hits with one run and one walk and three strikeouts in a 13–1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York.[115]
In 2021, Greinke finished with an 11–6 record and 4.16 ERA over 30 games (29 starts).[26] He ranked second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.895) and fifth in WHIP (1.170) and home runs (30).[116] In the World Series versus the Atlanta Braves, Greinke started Game 4, recording four scoreless innings. At the plate, he singled in the second inning to become the first Astros pitcher to get a hit in World Series play.[117] In Game 5, he was called in as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning and recorded a single, becoming the first pitcher to record a pinch hit in the World Series since Jack Bentley in 1923.[118] On November 3, 2021, Greinke was declared a free agent.[119]
Return to Kansas City Royals (2022–2023)
edit
 
Greinke pitching for the Kansas City Royals against the Cardinals in 2023.
Greinke expressed interest in finishing his career with the Royals, which he mentioned to George Brett during the 2021-22 lockout.[120] On March 16, 2022, Greinke signed a one-year, $13 million contract to return to the Royals.[121] On March 31, Greinke was announced as the Royals' Opening Day starter, the first time he'd been given the role for the Royals since 2010, marking the largest gap between Opening Day pitching starts for the same team.[122] He made his 500th career start on June 29 versus the Texas Rangers, going six innings in a 2−1 win.[123] Greinke finished 4–9 with a 3.68 ERA in 26 starts with the Royals in 2022.[26]
Greinke re-signed with the Royals on a one-year contract worth $8.5 million on February 3, 2023.[124] On March 24, Greinke was named the Royals' Opening Day starter for the second consecutive year.[125] On May 15, Greinke became the fifth pitcher (after Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, and Greg Maddux) to strike out 1,000 unique batters over his career.[126] He became a free agent following the season.
Pitching style
edit
Greinke throws six different pitches:
Four-seam fastball — 88–92 miles per hour (142–148 km/h)
Two-seam fastball — 86–91 miles per hour (138–146 km/h)
Cutter — 85–89 miles per hour (137–143 km/h)
Slider — 85–87 miles per hour (137–140 km/h)
Curveball — 66–77 miles per hour (106–124 km/h)
Changeup — 86–90 miles per hour (138–145 km/h)[127]
His curveball has two speeds with different types of movement, and he will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is thrown only to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common two-strike pitch.[128]
Greinke's slider has been one of his more effective pitches. Hitters have only a .154 batting average and .230 slugging percentage against the pitch. It has produced 51% of his strikeouts. Its whiff rate is 42%, and more than half the pitches put in play are ground balls.[129] However, he limits the use of the slider in order not to put excessive strain on his arm.[130]
Greinke has produced good strikeout-to-walk ratios throughout his career, finishing in his league's top 10 five times[26] and ranking eighth among active pitchers in the category, at 3.76:1 as of the end of the 2017 regular season.[131]
Greinke has been described as a "scientist as a pitcher" and is known for preparing for each start more extensively than most.[132]
Owing to his upright overhand pitching style, with a pause where the ball is hidden down next to his right knee before release, a forward-facing follow-through, and late movement that reaches the lower third of the strike zone, he is in an excellent position for fielding soft, short hits coming at him, which helped him gain many assists and six consecutive NL Gold Glove Awards as a pitcher. He was still awarded an NL Gold Glove in 2019 because he started the 2019 season in Arizona before being traded.

Batting
edit
Greinke is a good hitting pitcher, having won two Silver Slugger Awards in his career with a .225 batting average. He has also amassed nine stolen bases over his career (on ten stolen base attempts), and he has expressed a desire to end his career with ten home runs and ten stolen bases; he has nine of each, with his last home run and stolen base each being in 2019. He entered Game 5 of the 2021 World Series as a pinch-hitter and recorded a hit, being the first pitcher to have a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in 1923.[133] As of 2025, he is the last pitcher to have a hit in a postseason game, as the designated hitter was introduced in the National League in 2022, meaning that the pitcher is not required to hit at any point. In his fourth at-bat as a major leaguer, Greinke hit his first home run. Years later, when teammate Alex Gordon was in a slump, Greinke had the idea to take him into the video room and show the clip of his home run multiple times before leaving by saying, "Do more of that."[134]
Personal life
edit
Greinke is married to Emily Kuchar, whom he met while attending Apopka High School. Kuchar is a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and was Miss Daytona Beach USA 2008.[135][136] Their sons were born in 2015, 2017, and 2021.[137][138] They reside in Orlando, Florida.
Greinke's younger brother, Luke, was also a pitcher who played college baseball at Auburn University.[139] Luke was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 12th round (380th overall) of the 2008 MLB draft,[140] but was out of baseball a year later because of injuries.[141]

The Royals selected Greinke in the first round with the sixth pick of the 2002 MLB draft, after he won the Gatorade National Player of the Year Award as a high school senior. After playing in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2004. His career was nearly derailed by his battles with depression and anxiety in 2005 and 2006, and he missed most of the 2006 season. He returned in 2007 as a relief pitcher, before rejoining the starting rotation in 2008 and developing into one of the top pitchers in the game. In 2009, he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game, led the major leagues in earned run average (ERA), and won the American League Cy Young Award.
Following his first stint with the Royals, Greinke played for the Brewers, Angels, Dodgers, Diamondbacks, and Astros across 2011 to 2021. During this time, he won six consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 2014 to 2019, and led MLB in ERA for a second time in 2015 with the Dodgers. In 2022 he returned to the Royals.
A dedicated competitor often described as unique in his talent and demeanor by teammates, Greinke was a six-time All-Star, six-time Gold Glove Award winner, two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, two-time earned run average leader, and an American League Cy Young Award recipient.[3]
Greinke is one of only five pitchers (Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux, and Roger Clemens) to strike out 1,000 different batters, with his 1,000th strikeout coming against Joey Wiemer on May 14, 2023.[4]
Early life
edit
Greinke was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of teachers Donald and Marsha Greinke. He is of German descent, and was active in Little League and also excelled in tennis and golf tournaments as a youth.[5][6] As a teenager, Greinke helped lead his team to the Senior League World Series title in 1999. He played shortstop for the team, and his coach estimated that he hit close to .700 in the tournament.[7]
Greinke was primarily a shortstop when he started playing baseball at Apopka High School. He hit over .400 with 31 home runs in his high school career.[8] He worked as a relief pitcher as a sophomore and junior, before becoming a starting pitcher as a senior.[8] During his senior season, in 2002, Greinke compiled a 9–2 win–loss record, a 0.55 earned run average (ERA), and 118 strikeouts in 63 innings. He also held opposing batters to a .107 average.[8] He led his team to a 32–2 record and their third straight district title, and was selected as Gatorade National Player of the Year.[9] After the high school season ended, he played in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association All-Star Classic and impressed pro scouts with his performance against some of the best hitters in the country.[10]
Professional career
edit
Draft and minor leagues
edit
The Kansas City Royals selected Greinke in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft.[11] They felt Greinke was a polished player who could move quickly through their system.[8] Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University[12][13] to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.[14]
Greinke pitched in six minor league games (five starts) for the Royals farm teams in 2002: three games for the Gulf Coast Royals, two for the Low-A Spokane Indians, and two innings for the High-A Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. He had a 3.97 ERA in 11+1⁄3 innings.[15]
In 2003, Greinke opened the season with Wilmington, where he was 11–1 with a 1.14 ERA in 14 starts.[16] Those numbers earned spots on both the Carolina League mid-season[17] and post-season all-star teams as well as Carolina League Pitcher of the Year award.[18] The Blue Rocks' manager, Billy Gardner, Jr., remarked that Greinke was "the best pitcher I've ever seen at this level of the minor leagues."[19] He was promoted in July to the Double-A Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League,[19] where in nine starts he was 4–3 with a 3.23 ERA.[20] He had a couple of games where he struggled at Wichita and gave up a lot of runs. However, he bounced back and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the season.[19]
Greinke was named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year for 2003.[21] He was promoted by the Royals in 2004 to the Triple-A Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League, where he was 1–1 with a 2.51 ERA in six starts.[22]
Kansas City Royals (2004–2010)
edit
 
Greinke pitching for the Kansas City Royals in 2009
Greinke was called up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, allowing two earned runs in five innings. At 20 years old, he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.[23][24]
Greinke recorded his first career win on June 8, when he pitched seven scoreless innings against the Montreal Expos.[25] In 24 starts, Greinke finished the 2004 season with an 8–11 record and a 3.97 ERA.[26]
On June 10, 2005, Greinke recorded his first major league hit; a home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Russ Ortiz in a 12–11 loss. However, he also allowed 15 hits and 11 runs in that game. The 15 hits allowed tied a franchise record, while the 11 runs set a club record.[27] In 2005, Greinke led the American League in losses, finishing with a 5–17 record and a 5.80 ERA in 33 starts.[26]
Greinke was sometimes quiet and awkward in the clubhouse. To alleviate some of his anxiety and solitude, the Royals made arrangements for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett.[28] Still, by the 2005–2006 off-season he nearly quit baseball; Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he did not expect to return.[29] He left spring training for personal reasons in late February 2006.[30] It was later revealed that he was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder.[31] He reported back to the Royals' spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, on April 17, where he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely.[32] He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication.[28] Greinke only made three appearances out of the bullpen in 2006, and finished the year 1–0 with a 4.26 ERA.[26]
In 2007, Greinke returned to the Royals rotation at the start of the season, but was assigned to the bullpen in early May.[33] In 52 appearances (14 starts), Greinke finished 2007 with a 7–7 record, one save, and a 3.69 ERA.[26]
Greinke returned to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13–10 record along with 183 strikeouts.[26] His 3.47 ERA was the best by a full-time Royals starter in 11 years.[34] On January 26, 2009, he agreed to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38 million.[34]
After ending the 2008 season with 15 scoreless innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not allowing a run in his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run.[35] Greinke was named American League (AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors.[36] On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game.[37] On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.[38]
Greinke's record for the 2009 season was 16–8, and he posted an ERA of 2.16, the lowest in MLB.[26] On October 21, he was named American League Pitcher of the Year by Sporting News.[39] On October 28, Greinke was awarded the MLBPA Players Choice AL Pitcher of the Year. On November 17, 2009, he won the AL Cy Young Award.[40] Greinke credited some of his performance to his use of "modern pitching metrics" — statistics on team defense and defense independent pitching statistics — to calibrate his own approach to pitching. Greinke specifically mentioned FIP (fielding independent pitching), an indicator developed by sabermetrician Tom Tango, as his favorite statistic. "That's pretty much how I pitch, to try to keep my FIP as low as possible.[41]
Despite a stellar 2009 season, his performance in 2010 began to regress as he finished the year 10–14 with a 4.17 ERA and 181 strikeouts.[26]
Milwaukee Brewers (2011–2012)
edit
On December 17, 2010, Greinke reportedly asked the Royals to trade him, claiming that he was not motivated to play for a rebuilding team.[42] The Royals were unlikely to afford signing Greinke to a long-term deal once he became a free agent, so they agreed to trade him for some quality prospects.[43] On December 19, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with Yuniesky Betancourt and $2 million for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. He was given the number 13, instead of his preferred number 23, due to number 23 already being issued to Rickie Weeks.[44] Greinke would later admit that he handled the trade request poorly, saying that he was "pretty rude" on the way out,[45] but the deal worked out well for both teams.[46]
In February 2011, before reporting to his first spring training with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball.[47] He started the 2011 season on the disabled list.[48]
 
Greinke with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2011
Greinke made his Brewers debut in the second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011.[49] Despite missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke finished second on the team in wins with a 16–6 record in 28 starts. He also had a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts (seventh in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched while surrendering just 45 walks.[26][50] Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost percentage (.727) and sixth in wins.[50] He went a perfect 11–0 in his starts at Miller Park, the Brewers' home stadium.[51]
On April 7, 2012, the Brewers defeated the Cardinals 6–0 in Greinke's first start of the season after he pitched seven scoreless innings while giving up four hits and striking out seven.[52]
In an oddity, Greinke became the first pitcher to start three straight games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just four pitches for angrily throwing the ball into the ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning.[53] The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after five innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day.[54]
To begin 2012, Greinke made 21 starts with the Brewers and had a 9–3 record, 120 strikeouts, and a 3.44 ERA.[55]
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2012)
edit
Despite his success with the Brewers, the team was struggling and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27, 2012, in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked that it was one of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was fond of Greinke.[55]
Greinke made his first start for the Angels on July 29.[56] After a stretch of four unproductive starts from August 3–19 (1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs — all of them wins. In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in 28+1⁄3 innings.[56]
Greinke became the first pitcher since 1920 to record 13 strikeouts in five innings or less in a game against the Seattle Mariners on September 25. He then combined with four other Angels pitchers to tie an American League record by striking out 20 batters in a nine-inning game.[57] He finished his time with the Angels with a 6–2 record and a 3.53 ERA in 13 starts.[56] Overall in 2012, combined with both teams, Greinke made 34 starts with a 15–5 record, 200 strikeouts, and a 3.48 ERA.[26]
Los Angeles Dodgers (2013–2015)
edit
Greinke agreed to a six-year free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher at the time it was signed.[58] It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year, $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners.[59] Greinke later explained that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.[60]
On April 11, 2013, Greinke fractured his left collarbone in a brawl with Carlos Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin was hit by an inside pitch and charged the mound.[61] He was placed on the disabled list and it was revealed that he would require surgery,[62] which was performed on April 13.[63] It was estimated that he would miss eight weeks of the season. However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.[64] He returned to the Dodgers on May 15, tossing 5+1⁄3 innings of one-run ball and striking out four to earn the win.[65]
On June 11, 2013, Greinke was hit in the head and neck area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not participate in the brawl, he was unaffected.[66]
 
Greinke with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2013
Greinke picked up his 100th career win on August 5, 2013, against the St. Louis Cardinals.[67] He was 5–0 with a 1.23 ERA during the month of August and was selected as National League Pitcher of the Month.[68] Greinke finished his first season with the Dodgers with a 15–4 record and 2.63 ERA in 28 starts. He also batted .328, the highest batting average for a Dodgers pitcher since Orel Hershiser in the 1993 season.[69] He was awarded with the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the National League.[70]
Greinke began the 2014 season by setting an MLB record with 22 straight starts (dating back to July 2013) where he allowed two or fewer earned runs.[71][72] He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game[73] and finished the season with a 17–8 record and a 2.71 ERA in 32 starts, the highest win total in his career.[26] He won the Gold Glove Award as the best fielding pitcher in the National League.[74]
When Justin Upton of the San Diego Padres homered against Greinke in the eighth inning on June 13, 2015, it was the last run he surrendered until the All-Star break.[75] Greinke was then selected to the All-Star Game, his second straight appearance,[76] and chosen to be the starting pitcher for the National League squad. At that point in the season, Greinke carried a major league-leading 1.48 ERA with a 7–2 record.[77] After Greinke retired 28 consecutive batters over a span of two starts, Nationals outfielder Michael Taylor ended the streak in the third inning on July 19.[78]
Greinke's recorded a scoreless innings streak which reached 45 innings; it started on June 18 and ended on July 26 start against the New York Mets at Citi Field and is the sixth-longest streak in MLB history. He shared the NL Player of the Week honors with his teammate Clayton Kershaw for July 13–19.[79] Greinke finished the 2015 season with a 19–3 record, 200 strikeouts, and a major-league-best 1.66 ERA.[80] His ERA was the second lowest in Dodgers history behind Rube Marquard in 1916, and his ERA+ (225) and major-league-leading WHIP (0.844) were the best in franchise history.[81][82] He led all major league pitchers in left on base percentage, stranding 86.5% of base runners.[83]
Greinke pitched in two games in the 2015 National League Division Series against the New York Mets. He allowed five runs in 13+2⁄3 innings and took the loss in the deciding fifth game in the series.[84] At the conclusion of the series, it was announced that he would opt out of the last three years of his contract with the Dodgers and become a free agent.[85] He officially opted out on November 3.[86]
After the season, Greinke was selected as the Outstanding National League Pitcher at the Players Choice Awards,[87] and won his second Gold Glove Award.[88] Greinke finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting to Jake Arrieta.[89]
Arizona Diamondbacks (2016–2019)
edit
 
Greinke with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2016
On December 8, 2015, Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[90] Greinke started on Opening Day 2016 at Chase Field against the Colorado Rockies; he gave up seven runs in four innings, including two home runs to rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who was making his MLB debut. The Diamondbacks lost the game 10–5.[91] In his second start, on April 9, Greinke matched up against Kyle Hendricks and the Chicago Cubs. He allowed three runs in the first inning, and struggled through the rest of his outing. The Diamondbacks lost the game 4–2.[92] Greinke got his first win as a Diamondback on April 19, 2016, against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just one run in over six innings of work.[93][94] On July 3, 2016, Greinke was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left oblique strain.[95][96] On August 24, 2016, he recorded his 2000th career strikeout in the Diamondbacks' 10–9 win over Atlanta Braves.[97] Greinke made 26 starts in his first season with Arizona, and he had a 13–7 record and a 4.37 ERA in 158+2⁄3 innings.[26] He won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award after the season.[98]
In 2017, Greinke was selected to the NL All-Star team, his fourth All-Star selection. At the time of his selection he was 10–4 with a 3.05 ERA in 109+1⁄3 innings, 128 strikeouts (10.21 strikeouts per nine innings), WHIP of 1.02 and a .219 opponents batting average.[99] On September 16 versus the San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park, he completed eight shutout innings with two hits allowed and eight strikeouts as Arizona won, 2−0. His game score of 90 was the second-best of his career, and he also hit two doubles at the plate.[100] In 32 starts in 2017, Greinke finished with a 17–7 record, 215 strikeouts, and a 3.20 ERA in 202+1⁄3 innings.[26] The Diamondbacks finished with a 93–69 record and clinched a Wild Card spot, but lost to the Dodgers in the Division Series. Greinke won his fourth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award after the 2017 season. He also finished fourth in the Cy Young voting behind Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and Stephen Strasburg.[101]
Greinke was once again named an All-Star in 2018.[102] He finished the season with a 15–11 record and a 3.21 ERA in 33 starts.[103] Following the season, he won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award.[104]
On April 2, 2019, Greinke hit two home runs and struck out 10 as the Diamondbacks won 8–5 against the Padres.[105] In 2019 with Arizona before he was traded, he was 10–4 with a 2.90 ERA.[26]
Greinke batted .271 with three home runs and 8 RBI with the Diamondbacks in 2019, earning him his second career Silver Slugger Award.[106]
Houston Astros (2019–2021)
edit
On July 31, 2019, the Diamondbacks traded Greinke to the Houston Astros with cash considerations for four minor league prospects: Corbin Martin, J. B. Bukauskas, Seth Beer, and Joshua Rojas.[107] The Diamondbacks also agreed to pay $24 million of Greinke's remaining $77 million salary.
On September 14, 2019, against the Kansas City Royals, Greinke became the 19th pitcher in MLB history to win a game against all 30 MLB franchises.[108] In 2019 with the Astros, he was 8–1 with a 3.02 ERA.[26] Between the two teams, in 2019 he was 18–5 with a 2.93 ERA, as in 208.2 innings (sixth in the majors) over 33 starts he walked only 30 batters (1.3 walks per nine innings, the best ratio of his career and third-best in the major leagues), and had a WHIP of 0.982 (fifth-best in the major leagues).[26] At the plate, he batted .280/.308/.580 with three home runs and 8 RBI in 50 at bats.[26] Greinke started Games 3 and 7 of the 2019 World Series for Houston. Greinke allowed two runs on two hits in 6+1⁄3 innings in his Game 7 start.[109][110] He was pulled by manager A. J. Hinch in the seventh inning after surrendering a one-out home run to Anthony Rendon, followed by a walk to Juan Soto, with the Astros leading 2–1.[109][110] He was replaced by Will Harris, who allowed a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick. The Astros lost the game 6–2, prompting questions by members of the media about Hinch's decision to pull Greinke.[109][110][111]
In 2020, Greinke produced a 3–3 record with a 4.03 ERA in 12 starts spanning 67 innings, and was second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.209) and fourth in home runs per nine innings (0.806).[26][112]
On April 1, 2021, Greinke earned his first Opening Day win and 209th win overall as the Astros defeated the Oakland Athletics, 8–1, at the Oakland Coliseum. He pitched six scoreless innings, the 65th time his career he has produced at least six scoreless innings.[113] In the May 25 contest versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, he reached 3,000 career innings, the 135th pitcher in major league history to achieve this milestone.[114] On June 4, 2021, Greinke threw a complete game for the first time since April 19, 2017. He allowed six hits with one run and one walk and three strikeouts in a 13–1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York.[115]
In 2021, Greinke finished with an 11–6 record and 4.16 ERA over 30 games (29 starts).[26] He ranked second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.895) and fifth in WHIP (1.170) and home runs (30).[116] In the World Series versus the Atlanta Braves, Greinke started Game 4, recording four scoreless innings. At the plate, he singled in the second inning to become the first Astros pitcher to get a hit in World Series play.[117] In Game 5, he was called in as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning and recorded a single, becoming the first pitcher to record a pinch hit in the World Series since Jack Bentley in 1923.[118] On November 3, 2021, Greinke was declared a free agent.[119]
Return to Kansas City Royals (2022–2023)
edit
 
Greinke pitching for the Kansas City Royals against the Cardinals in 2023.
Greinke expressed interest in finishing his career with the Royals, which he mentioned to George Brett during the 2021-22 lockout.[120] On March 16, 2022, Greinke signed a one-year, $13 million contract to return to the Royals.[121] On March 31, Greinke was announced as the Royals' Opening Day starter, the first time he'd been given the role for the Royals since 2010, marking the largest gap between Opening Day pitching starts for the same team.[122] He made his 500th career start on June 29 versus the Texas Rangers, going six innings in a 2−1 win.[123] Greinke finished 4–9 with a 3.68 ERA in 26 starts with the Royals in 2022.[26]
Greinke re-signed with the Royals on a one-year contract worth $8.5 million on February 3, 2023.[124] On March 24, Greinke was named the Royals' Opening Day starter for the second consecutive year.[125] On May 15, Greinke became the fifth pitcher (after Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, and Greg Maddux) to strike out 1,000 unique batters over his career.[126] He became a free agent following the season.
Pitching style
edit
Greinke throws six different pitches:
Four-seam fastball — 88–92 miles per hour (142–148 km/h)
Two-seam fastball — 86–91 miles per hour (138–146 km/h)
Cutter — 85–89 miles per hour (137–143 km/h)
Slider — 85–87 miles per hour (137–140 km/h)
Curveball — 66–77 miles per hour (106–124 km/h)
Changeup — 86–90 miles per hour (138–145 km/h)[127]
His curveball has two speeds with different types of movement, and he will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is thrown only to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common two-strike pitch.[128]
Greinke's slider has been one of his more effective pitches. Hitters have only a .154 batting average and .230 slugging percentage against the pitch. It has produced 51% of his strikeouts. Its whiff rate is 42%, and more than half the pitches put in play are ground balls.[129] However, he limits the use of the slider in order not to put excessive strain on his arm.[130]
Greinke has produced good strikeout-to-walk ratios throughout his career, finishing in his league's top 10 five times[26] and ranking eighth among active pitchers in the category, at 3.76:1 as of the end of the 2017 regular season.[131]
Greinke has been described as a "scientist as a pitcher" and is known for preparing for each start more extensively than most.[132]
Owing to his upright overhand pitching style, with a pause where the ball is hidden down next to his right knee before release, a forward-facing follow-through, and late movement that reaches the lower third of the strike zone, he is in an excellent position for fielding soft, short hits coming at him, which helped him gain many assists and six consecutive NL Gold Glove Awards as a pitcher. He was still awarded an NL Gold Glove in 2019 because he started the 2019 season in Arizona before being traded.

Batting
edit
Greinke is a good hitting pitcher, having won two Silver Slugger Awards in his career with a .225 batting average. He has also amassed nine stolen bases over his career (on ten stolen base attempts), and he has expressed a desire to end his career with ten home runs and ten stolen bases; he has nine of each, with his last home run and stolen base each being in 2019. He entered Game 5 of the 2021 World Series as a pinch-hitter and recorded a hit, being the first pitcher to have a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in 1923.[133] As of 2025, he is the last pitcher to have a hit in a postseason game, as the designated hitter was introduced in the National League in 2022, meaning that the pitcher is not required to hit at any point. In his fourth at-bat as a major leaguer, Greinke hit his first home run. Years later, when teammate Alex Gordon was in a slump, Greinke had the idea to take him into the video room and show the clip of his home run multiple times before leaving by saying, "Do more of that."[134]
Personal life
edit
Greinke is married to Emily Kuchar, whom he met while attending Apopka High School. Kuchar is a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and was Miss Daytona Beach USA 2008.[135][136] Their sons were born in 2015, 2017, and 2021.[137][138] They reside in Orlando, Florida.
Greinke's younger brother, Luke, was also a pitcher who played college baseball at Auburn University.[139] Luke was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 12th round (380th overall) of the 2008 MLB draft,[140] but was out of baseball a year later because of injuries.[141]

The Royals selected Greinke in the first round with the sixth pick of the 2002 MLB draft, after he won the Gatorade National Player of the Year Award as a high school senior. After playing in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2004. His career was nearly derailed by his battles with depression and anxiety in 2005 and 2006, and he missed most of the 2006 season. He returned in 2007 as a relief pitcher, before rejoining the starting rotation in 2008 and developing into one of the top pitchers in the game. In 2009, he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game, led the major leagues in earned run average (ERA), and won the American League Cy Young Award.
Following his first stint with the Royals, Greinke played for the Brewers, Angels, Dodgers, Diamondbacks, and Astros across 2011 to 2021. During this time, he won six consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 2014 to 2019, and led MLB in ERA for a second time in 2015 with the Dodgers. In 2022 he returned to the Royals.
A dedicated competitor often described as unique in his talent and demeanor by teammates, Greinke was a six-time All-Star, six-time Gold Glove Award winner, two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, two-time earned run average leader, and an American League Cy Young Award recipient.[3]
Greinke is one of only five pitchers (Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux, and Roger Clemens) to strike out 1,000 different batters, with his 1,000th strikeout coming against Joey Wiemer on May 14, 2023.[4]
Early life
edit
Greinke was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of teachers Donald and Marsha Greinke. He is of German descent, and was active in Little League and also excelled in tennis and golf tournaments as a youth.[5][6] As a teenager, Greinke helped lead his team to the Senior League World Series title in 1999. He played shortstop for the team, and his coach estimated that he hit close to .700 in the tournament.[7]
Greinke was primarily a shortstop when he started playing baseball at Apopka High School. He hit over .400 with 31 home runs in his high school career.[8] He worked as a relief pitcher as a sophomore and junior, before becoming a starting pitcher as a senior.[8] During his senior season, in 2002, Greinke compiled a 9–2 win–loss record, a 0.55 earned run average (ERA), and 118 strikeouts in 63 innings. He also held opposing batters to a .107 average.[8] He led his team to a 32–2 record and their third straight district title, and was selected as Gatorade National Player of the Year.[9] After the high school season ended, he played in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association All-Star Classic and impressed pro scouts with his performance against some of the best hitters in the country.[10]
Professional career
edit
Draft and minor leagues
edit
The Kansas City Royals selected Greinke in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft.[11] They felt Greinke was a polished player who could move quickly through their system.[8] Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University[12][13] to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.[14]
Greinke pitched in six minor league games (five starts) for the Royals farm teams in 2002: three games for the Gulf Coast Royals, two for the Low-A Spokane Indians, and two innings for the High-A Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. He had a 3.97 ERA in 11+1⁄3 innings.[15]
In 2003, Greinke opened the season with Wilmington, where he was 11–1 with a 1.14 ERA in 14 starts.[16] Those numbers earned spots on both the Carolina League mid-season[17] and post-season all-star teams as well as Carolina League Pitcher of the Year award.[18] The Blue Rocks' manager, Billy Gardner, Jr., remarked that Greinke was "the best pitcher I've ever seen at this level of the minor leagues."[19] He was promoted in July to the Double-A Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League,[19] where in nine starts he was 4–3 with a 3.23 ERA.[20] He had a couple of games where he struggled at Wichita and gave up a lot of runs. However, he bounced back and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the season.[19]
Greinke was named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year for 2003.[21] He was promoted by the Royals in 2004 to the Triple-A Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League, where he was 1–1 with a 2.51 ERA in six starts.[22]
Kansas City Royals (2004–2010)
edit
 
Greinke pitching for the Kansas City Royals in 2009
Greinke was called up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, allowing two earned runs in five innings. At 20 years old, he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.[23][24]
Greinke recorded his first career win on June 8, when he pitched seven scoreless innings against the Montreal Expos.[25] In 24 starts, Greinke finished the 2004 season with an 8–11 record and a 3.97 ERA.[26]
On June 10, 2005, Greinke recorded his first major league hit; a home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Russ Ortiz in a 12–11 loss. However, he also allowed 15 hits and 11 runs in that game. The 15 hits allowed tied a franchise record, while the 11 runs set a club record.[27] In 2005, Greinke led the American League in losses, finishing with a 5–17 record and a 5.80 ERA in 33 starts.[26]
Greinke was sometimes quiet and awkward in the clubhouse. To alleviate some of his anxiety and solitude, the Royals made arrangements for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett.[28] Still, by the 2005–2006 off-season he nearly quit baseball; Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he did not expect to return.[29] He left spring training for personal reasons in late February 2006.[30] It was later revealed that he was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder.[31] He reported back to the Royals' spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, on April 17, where he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely.[32] He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication.[28] Greinke only made three appearances out of the bullpen in 2006, and finished the year 1–0 with a 4.26 ERA.[26]
In 2007, Greinke returned to the Royals rotation at the start of the season, but was assigned to the bullpen in early May.[33] In 52 appearances (14 starts), Greinke finished 2007 with a 7–7 record, one save, and a 3.69 ERA.[26]
Greinke returned to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13–10 record along with 183 strikeouts.[26] His 3.47 ERA was the best by a full-time Royals starter in 11 years.[34] On January 26, 2009, he agreed to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38 million.[34]
After ending the 2008 season with 15 scoreless innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not allowing a run in his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run.[35] Greinke was named American League (AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors.[36] On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game.[37] On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.[38]
Greinke's record for the 2009 season was 16–8, and he posted an ERA of 2.16, the lowest in MLB.[26] On October 21, he was named American League Pitcher of the Year by Sporting News.[39] On October 28, Greinke was awarded the MLBPA Players Choice AL Pitcher of the Year. On November 17, 2009, he won the AL Cy Young Award.[40] Greinke credited some of his performance to his use of "modern pitching metrics" — statistics on team defense and defense independent pitching statistics — to calibrate his own approach to pitching. Greinke specifically mentioned FIP (fielding independent pitching), an indicator developed by sabermetrician Tom Tango, as his favorite statistic. "That's pretty much how I pitch, to try to keep my FIP as low as possible.[41]
Despite a stellar 2009 season, his performance in 2010 began to regress as he finished the year 10–14 with a 4.17 ERA and 181 strikeouts.[26]
Milwaukee Brewers (2011–2012)
edit
On December 17, 2010, Greinke reportedly asked the Royals to trade him, claiming that he was not motivated to play for a rebuilding team.[42] The Royals were unlikely to afford signing Greinke to a long-term deal once he became a free agent, so they agreed to trade him for some quality prospects.[43] On December 19, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with Yuniesky Betancourt and $2 million for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. He was given the number 13, instead of his preferred number 23, due to number 23 already being issued to Rickie Weeks.[44] Greinke would later admit that he handled the trade request poorly, saying that he was "pretty rude" on the way out,[45] but the deal worked out well for both teams.[46]
In February 2011, before reporting to his first spring training with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball.[47] He started the 2011 season on the disabled list.[48]
 
Greinke with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2011
Greinke made his Brewers debut in the second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011.[49] Despite missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke finished second on the team in wins with a 16–6 record in 28 starts. He also had a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts (seventh in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched while surrendering just 45 walks.[26][50] Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost percentage (.727) and sixth in wins.[50] He went a perfect 11–0 in his starts at Miller Park, the Brewers' home stadium.[51]
On April 7, 2012, the Brewers defeated the Cardinals 6–0 in Greinke's first start of the season after he pitched seven scoreless innings while giving up four hits and striking out seven.[52]
In an oddity, Greinke became the first pitcher to start three straight games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just four pitches for angrily throwing the ball into the ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning.[53] The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after five innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day.[54]
To begin 2012, Greinke made 21 starts with the Brewers and had a 9–3 record, 120 strikeouts, and a 3.44 ERA.[55]
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2012)
edit
Despite his success with the Brewers, the team was struggling and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27, 2012, in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked that it was one of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was fond of Greinke.[55]
Greinke made his first start for the Angels on July 29.[56] After a stretch of four unproductive starts from August 3–19 (1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs — all of them wins. In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in 28+1⁄3 innings.[56]
Greinke became the first pitcher since 1920 to record 13 strikeouts in five innings or less in a game against the Seattle Mariners on September 25. He then combined with four other Angels pitchers to tie an American League record by striking out 20 batters in a nine-inning game.[57] He finished his time with the Angels with a 6–2 record and a 3.53 ERA in 13 starts.[56] Overall in 2012, combined with both teams, Greinke made 34 starts with a 15–5 record, 200 strikeouts, and a 3.48 ERA.[26]
Los Angeles Dodgers (2013–2015)
edit
Greinke agreed to a six-year free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher at the time it was signed.[58] It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year, $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners.[59] Greinke later explained that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.[60]
On April 11, 2013, Greinke fractured his left collarbone in a brawl with Carlos Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin was hit by an inside pitch and charged the mound.[61] He was placed on the disabled list and it was revealed that he would require surgery,[62] which was performed on April 13.[63] It was estimated that he would miss eight weeks of the season. However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.[64] He returned to the Dodgers on May 15, tossing 5+1⁄3 innings of one-run ball and striking out four to earn the win.[65]
On June 11, 2013, Greinke was hit in the head and neck area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not participate in the brawl, he was unaffected.[66]
 
Greinke with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2013
Greinke picked up his 100th career win on August 5, 2013, against the St. Louis Cardinals.[67] He was 5–0 with a 1.23 ERA during the month of August and was selected as National League Pitcher of the Month.[68] Greinke finished his first season with the Dodgers with a 15–4 record and 2.63 ERA in 28 starts. He also batted .328, the highest batting average for a Dodgers pitcher since Orel Hershiser in the 1993 season.[69] He was awarded with the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the National League.[70]
Greinke began the 2014 season by setting an MLB record with 22 straight starts (dating back to July 2013) where he allowed two or fewer earned runs.[71][72] He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game[73] and finished the season with a 17–8 record and a 2.71 ERA in 32 starts, the highest win total in his career.[26] He won the Gold Glove Award as the best fielding pitcher in the National League.[74]
When Justin Upton of the San Diego Padres homered against Greinke in the eighth inning on June 13, 2015, it was the last run he surrendered until the All-Star break.[75] Greinke was then selected to the All-Star Game, his second straight appearance,[76] and chosen to be the starting pitcher for the National League squad. At that point in the season, Greinke carried a major league-leading 1.48 ERA with a 7–2 record.[77] After Greinke retired 28 consecutive batters over a span of two starts, Nationals outfielder Michael Taylor ended the streak in the third inning on July 19.[78]
Greinke's recorded a scoreless innings streak which reached 45 innings; it started on June 18 and ended on July 26 start against the New York Mets at Citi Field and is the sixth-longest streak in MLB history. He shared the NL Player of the Week honors with his teammate Clayton Kershaw for July 13–19.[79] Greinke finished the 2015 season with a 19–3 record, 200 strikeouts, and a major-league-best 1.66 ERA.[80] His ERA was the second lowest in Dodgers history behind Rube Marquard in 1916, and his ERA+ (225) and major-league-leading WHIP (0.844) were the best in franchise history.[81][82] He led all major league pitchers in left on base percentage, stranding 86.5% of base runners.[83]
Greinke pitched in two games in the 2015 National League Division Series against the New York Mets. He allowed five runs in 13+2⁄3 innings and took the loss in the deciding fifth game in the series.[84] At the conclusion of the series, it was announced that he would opt out of the last three years of his contract with the Dodgers and become a free agent.[85] He officially opted out on November 3.[86]
After the season, Greinke was selected as the Outstanding National League Pitcher at the Players Choice Awards,[87] and won his second Gold Glove Award.[88] Greinke finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting to Jake Arrieta.[89]
Arizona Diamondbacks (2016–2019)
edit
 
Greinke with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2016
On December 8, 2015, Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[90] Greinke started on Opening Day 2016 at Chase Field against the Colorado Rockies; he gave up seven runs in four innings, including two home runs to rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who was making his MLB debut. The Diamondbacks lost the game 10–5.[91] In his second start, on April 9, Greinke matched up against Kyle Hendricks and the Chicago Cubs. He allowed three runs in the first inning, and struggled through the rest of his outing. The Diamondbacks lost the game 4–2.[92] Greinke got his first win as a Diamondback on April 19, 2016, against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just one run in over six innings of work.[93][94] On July 3, 2016, Greinke was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left oblique strain.[95][96] On August 24, 2016, he recorded his 2000th career strikeout in the Diamondbacks' 10–9 win over Atlanta Braves.[97] Greinke made 26 starts in his first season with Arizona, and he had a 13–7 record and a 4.37 ERA in 158+2⁄3 innings.[26] He won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award after the season.[98]
In 2017, Greinke was selected to the NL All-Star team, his fourth All-Star selection. At the time of his selection he was 10–4 with a 3.05 ERA in 109+1⁄3 innings, 128 strikeouts (10.21 strikeouts per nine innings), WHIP of 1.02 and a .219 opponents batting average.[99] On September 16 versus the San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park, he completed eight shutout innings with two hits allowed and eight strikeouts as Arizona won, 2−0. His game score of 90 was the second-best of his career, and he also hit two doubles at the plate.[100] In 32 starts in 2017, Greinke finished with a 17–7 record, 215 strikeouts, and a 3.20 ERA in 202+1⁄3 innings.[26] The Diamondbacks finished with a 93–69 record and clinched a Wild Card spot, but lost to the Dodgers in the Division Series. Greinke won his fourth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award after the 2017 season. He also finished fourth in the Cy Young voting behind Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and Stephen Strasburg.[101]
Greinke was once again named an All-Star in 2018.[102] He finished the season with a 15–11 record and a 3.21 ERA in 33 starts.[103] Following the season, he won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award.[104]
On April 2, 2019, Greinke hit two home runs and struck out 10 as the Diamondbacks won 8–5 against the Padres.[105] In 2019 with Arizona before he was traded, he was 10–4 with a 2.90 ERA.[26]
Greinke batted .271 with three home runs and 8 RBI with the Diamondbacks in 2019, earning him his second career Silver Slugger Award.[106]
Houston Astros (2019–2021)
edit
On July 31, 2019, the Diamondbacks traded Greinke to the Houston Astros with cash considerations for four minor league prospects: Corbin Martin, J. B. Bukauskas, Seth Beer, and Joshua Rojas.[107] The Diamondbacks also agreed to pay $24 million of Greinke's remaining $77 million salary.
On September 14, 2019, against the Kansas City Royals, Greinke became the 19th pitcher in MLB history to win a game against all 30 MLB franchises.[108] In 2019 with the Astros, he was 8–1 with a 3.02 ERA.[26] Between the two teams, in 2019 he was 18–5 with a 2.93 ERA, as in 208.2 innings (sixth in the majors) over 33 starts he walked only 30 batters (1.3 walks per nine innings, the best ratio of his career and third-best in the major leagues), and had a WHIP of 0.982 (fifth-best in the major leagues).[26] At the plate, he batted .280/.308/.580 with three home runs and 8 RBI in 50 at bats.[26] Greinke started Games 3 and 7 of the 2019 World Series for Houston. Greinke allowed two runs on two hits in 6+1⁄3 innings in his Game 7 start.[109][110] He was pulled by manager A. J. Hinch in the seventh inning after surrendering a one-out home run to Anthony Rendon, followed by a walk to Juan Soto, with the Astros leading 2–1.[109][110] He was replaced by Will Harris, who allowed a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick. The Astros lost the game 6–2, prompting questions by members of the media about Hinch's decision to pull Greinke.[109][110][111]
In 2020, Greinke produced a 3–3 record with a 4.03 ERA in 12 starts spanning 67 innings, and was second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.209) and fourth in home runs per nine innings (0.806).[26][112]
On April 1, 2021, Greinke earned his first Opening Day win and 209th win overall as the Astros defeated the Oakland Athletics, 8–1, at the Oakland Coliseum. He pitched six scoreless innings, the 65th time his career he has produced at least six scoreless innings.[113] In the May 25 contest versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, he reached 3,000 career innings, the 135th pitcher in major league history to achieve this milestone.[114] On June 4, 2021, Greinke threw a complete game for the first time since April 19, 2017. He allowed six hits with one run and one walk and three strikeouts in a 13–1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York.[115]
In 2021, Greinke finished with an 11–6 record and 4.16 ERA over 30 games (29 starts).[26] He ranked second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.895) and fifth in WHIP (1.170) and home runs (30).[116] In the World Series versus the Atlanta Braves, Greinke started Game 4, recording four scoreless innings. At the plate, he singled in the second inning to become the first Astros pitcher to get a hit in World Series play.[117] In Game 5, he was called in as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning and recorded a single, becoming the first pitcher to record a pinch hit in the World Series since Jack Bentley in 1923.[118] On November 3, 2021, Greinke was declared a free agent.[119]
Return to Kansas City Royals (2022–2023)
edit
 
Greinke pitching for the Kansas City Royals against the Cardinals in 2023.
Greinke expressed interest in finishing his career with the Royals, which he mentioned to George Brett during the 2021-22 lockout.[120] On March 16, 2022, Greinke signed a one-year, $13 million contract to return to the Royals.[121] On March 31, Greinke was announced as the Royals' Opening Day starter, the first time he'd been given the role for the Royals since 2010, marking the largest gap between Opening Day pitching starts for the same team.[122] He made his 500th career start on June 29 versus the Texas Rangers, going six innings in a 2−1 win.[123] Greinke finished 4–9 with a 3.68 ERA in 26 starts with the Royals in 2022.[26]
Greinke re-signed with the Royals on a one-year contract worth $8.5 million on February 3, 2023.[124] On March 24, Greinke was named the Royals' Opening Day starter for the second consecutive year.[125] On May 15, Greinke became the fifth pitcher (after Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, and Greg Maddux) to strike out 1,000 unique batters over his career.[126] He became a free agent following the season.
Pitching style
edit
Greinke throws six different pitches:
Four-seam fastball — 88–92 miles per hour (142–148 km/h)
Two-seam fastball — 86–91 miles per hour (138–146 km/h)
Cutter — 85–89 miles per hour (137–143 km/h)
Slider — 85–87 miles per hour (137–140 km/h)
Curveball — 66–77 miles per hour (106–124 km/h)
Changeup — 86–90 miles per hour (138–145 km/h)[127]
His curveball has two speeds with different types of movement, and he will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is thrown only to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common two-strike pitch.[128]
Greinke's slider has been one of his more effective pitches. Hitters have only a .154 batting average and .230 slugging percentage against the pitch. It has produced 51% of his strikeouts. Its whiff rate is 42%, and more than half the pitches put in play are ground balls.[129] However, he limits the use of the slider in order not to put excessive strain on his arm.[130]
Greinke has produced good strikeout-to-walk ratios throughout his career, finishing in his league's top 10 five times[26] and ranking eighth among active pitchers in the category, at 3.76:1 as of the end of the 2017 regular season.[131]
Greinke has been described as a "scientist as a pitcher" and is known for preparing for each start more extensively than most.[132]
Owing to his upright overhand pitching style, with a pause where the ball is hidden down next to his right knee before release, a forward-facing follow-through, and late movement that reaches the lower third of the strike zone, he is in an excellent position for fielding soft, short hits coming at him, which helped him gain many assists and six consecutive NL Gold Glove Awards as a pitcher. He was still awarded an NL Gold Glove in 2019 because he started the 2019 season in Arizona before being traded.

Batting
edit
Greinke is a good hitting pitcher, having won two Silver Slugger Awards in his career with a .225 batting average. He has also amassed nine stolen bases over his career (on ten stolen base attempts), and he has expressed a desire to end his career with ten home runs and ten stolen bases; he has nine of each, with his last home run and stolen base each being in 2019. He entered Game 5 of the 2021 World Series as a pinch-hitter and recorded a hit, being the first pitcher to have a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in 1923.[133] As of 2025, he is the last pitcher to have a hit in a postseason game, as the designated hitter was introduced in the National League in 2022, meaning that the pitcher is not required to hit at any point. In his fourth at-bat as a major leaguer, Greinke hit his first home run. Years later, when teammate Alex Gordon was in a slump, Greinke had the idea to take him into the video room and show the clip of his home run multiple times before leaving by saying, "Do more of that."[134]
Personal life
edit
Greinke is married to Emily Kuchar, whom he met while attending Apopka High School. Kuchar is a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and was Miss Daytona Beach USA 2008.[135][136] Their sons were born in 2015, 2017, and 2021.[137][138] They reside in Orlando, Florida.
Greinke's younger brother, Luke, was also a pitcher who played college baseball at Auburn University.[139] Luke was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 12th round (380th overall) of the 2008 MLB draft,[140] but was out of baseball a year later because of injuries.[141]
