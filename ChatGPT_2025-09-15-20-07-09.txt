Give me a single exhaustive & verbose sentence that lays out the user-visible purpose and possibilities of every respective function and setting available for OpenAI's new Codex platform.

Clarification:one-sentence-per-function/setting.

The previous prompt resulted in an error message reading "The network connection was lost." with a "Retry" button 3 times in a row. How could I reword my prompt to avoid a 4 error?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Here are a few re-phrasings (and why they’re less likely to trip the system) —pick whichever best matches what you need:

Goal	Safer re-worded prompt	Why it helps
Keep everything but remove the “single sentence” strain	“For each user-visible function and setting in OpenAI Codex, give me one clear sentence that states its main purpose and typical uses.”	Removes the “exhaustive & verbose single sentence” constraint, so the model can respond in shorter chunks and stay within token limits.
Allow multi-step output if there are many items	“List all user-visible functions and settings in OpenAI Codex and, for each, add one explanatory sentence about its purpose and possibilities. You can respond in multiple numbered chunks if needed.”	Grants permission to break the answer into several messages, avoiding oversized replies that sometimes cause connection drops.
Split the request into two manageable parts	Part 1: “Name every user-visible function and setting in OpenAI Codex.” Part 2 (after it answers): “Now give me one descriptive sentence for each item.”	Reduces complexity per call; you only risk network issues on much smaller messages.
If you truly need one giant sentence per item (but not one mega-sentence overall)	“Produce a paragraph in which each sentence (no commas or semicolons inside) describes one distinct user-visible function or setting of OpenAI Codex: state purpose + possibilities.”	Clarifies that you want multiple sentences, each short, instead of one monster sentence; still satisfies “one-sentence-per-function.”
When detail matters more than completeness	“Summarise the most important user-visible functions/settings of OpenAI Codex, giving one concise explanatory sentence apiece.”	Narrows scope so the model can answer without hitting maximum length or timing out.

Extra tips

Avoid words like “exhaustive & verbose” and “single sentence”—they push the model toward very long outputs that sometimes exceed internal limits.

Explicitly allow multi-message or chunked replies if the list might be long.

Break big requests into sequential steps whenever you see recurrent network-connection errors; you can recombine the answers yourself afterward.

Remember that occasional “network connection was lost” pop-ups can be front-end glitches—retry once, then simplify or shorten if it happens repeatedly.

Try one of the re-wordings above and you should sidestep the fourth error.
