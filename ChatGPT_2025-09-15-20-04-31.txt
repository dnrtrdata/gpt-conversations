A pitcher can do magic with a baseball.
He can throw it harder than 100 mph, or slower than 70 mph. He can make it break to the left, or the right, or make it look like it's rising or sinking. It's amazing to watch.
Now here's how to tell which of the magician's tricks is which.
There are a whole array of pitch types, and each one has its own unique qualities, its own combinations of grip and speed and movement.
So here's your guide to the different pitches you might see in an MLB game -- and how to tell them apart.
Four-seam fastball
Let's start with the fastballs.
This one's easy. A four-seam fastball is the fundamental pitch of baseball. It's straight, and it's hard. Heck, if it's a really good one, it might even look like it's rising. That's an optical illusion -- one of the cooler ones a pitcher can pull off with a baseball. Justin Verlander is one of the best at it.

Statcast: Verlander's 11-K start
Here's how it works: A four-seamer is thrown with straight backspin. When the ball is spinning that way, it will resist the pull of gravity slightly longer. So if a pitcher does it just right, a four-seam fastball will look like it's "exploding" up and past the hitter. The hitter will swing under it and miss. Ask any hitter who's had to face Max Scherzer, and they'll tell you what that feels like.

Two-seam fastball / sinker
A four-seamer is your basic fastball. The two-seamer and sinker are the main variations. They're pretty similar, so we group them together. Two-seamers and sinkers have basically the same speed as a four-seamer; the big difference is the way they move. A four-seamer is straight, sometimes so straight it looks like it's rising. Two-seamers and sinkers move side to side, or down. Or both.

If the pitch moves more horizontally -- and it'll be in the "tailing" direction, running from left to right for a right-handed pitcher or right to left for a left-handed pitcher -- then it's a two-seamer. If the pitch has more vertical drop, it's a sinker.
See how this pitch from Yu Darvish moves hard from left to right? How Matt Carpenter thinks it will be inside, and then it runs back over the plate for a strikeout? That's a two-seamer.

Cutter
There's a third type of fastball, but it's a little different from four-seamers, two-seamers and sinkers. It's the cutter.
The main difference, again, is the direction of the movement. Four-seamers carry. Two-seamers run. Sinkers drop. Cutters, well, cut. "Cutting" movement means horizontal, in the opposite direction of a two-seamer. A cutter from a right-handed pitcher takes a turn from right-to-left; from a lefty, that cut is left to right. A lot of the time, a cutter doesn't even break all that much. The movement isn't wide and sweeping, it's sharp and tight.
Here's Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen throwing a nasty one for a game-ending strikeout. He's probably the best known cutter user today.

Slider
Now we move on to the breaking balls -- the pitch types whose defining quality is movement, rather than speed. Let's start with a slider.
The slider moves sideways, in the same direction as a cutter -- right to left for a right-handed pitcher, left to right for a righty. And actually, sometimes those two pitch types can be hard to tell apart. But here's the best way to do it: Usually, a slider's movement is more sweeping, and larger, than a cutter's, and it can also include more vertical as well as horizontal break. Here's one from Chris Archer.

Freddy Peralta strikes out swinging.
A cutter will head straight like a fastball and then take a sudden left or right turn. With a slider, you should see the break happening from the beginning to the end.
That's especially true when you have someone who throws from a lower arm angle, like sidearming lefty Chris Sale. Look at how his slider "sweeps" across the plate, in addition to breaking down. This is the pitch that ended the 2018 World Series.

Curveball
Many a baseball fan will tell you that the curveball is the game's most aesthetically pleasing pitch. When you see one done perfectly, it's easy to understand why.

Aug 28, 2018 · 0:16

A curveball's break is loopy and large. It goes up, and then down. You can see it jump up out of the pitcher's hand, and then tumble almost in slow motion back to earth. Faced with a great curveball, a hitter might often be rendered unable to swing, watching helplessly as it falls for a strike. Maybe his knees will even buckle.
A curve is slower than a slider. Its movement direction is more up and down. It can look like it will sail over a hitter's head, and then end up dropping in at their knees. A curveball can look like a rainbow. Watch Clayton Kershaw's, and you might say it's even more beautiful.

Changeup
Lastly, we come to the "offspeed" pitches. The changeup is the main type. Changeups are pitches that are supposed to look like a fastball … only they're slow, not fast. They fool the hitter into swinging too soon, expecting a harder pitch. Different pitchers throw their changeups at different speeds -- the key isn't the specific velocity, but the differential in speed between the pitcher's changeup and his fastball.
Changeups do have movement, too. They make the hitter swing not only too early, but also in the wrong spot. The kind of movement might best be described as "fade."

Oct 28, 2018 · 0:24
Max Muncy strikes out swinging.
First of all, because a changeup is slower than a fastball, it tends to have some drop. Second, because of how a pitcher throws a changeup, it can also have some horizontal run, in the direction of his pitching arm side. That's because a pitcher will often let a changeup "tumble" out of his fingertips, leaving it to fade away from his body.
Watch someone like "King" Felix Hernandez throw his changeup, or go back and watch old highlights of a changeup legend like Johan Santana, and you'll have seen among the best.

Hernandez's 6th straight K
Splitter
There's one other key type of offspeed pitch, but you wouldn't be able to tell from its name. "Splitter" is short for "split-fingered fastball."
Which turns out to be ironic, because a splitter doesn't function as a fastball at all. It's really a complement to a pitcher's primary fastball. A splitter looks just like that fastball until the bottom drops out, and hoodwinks a hitter into flailing too early and over the top of the ball.
The splitter's defining characteristic, which gives it its name, is how the pitcher grips it: with pointer and middle finger spread wide around the baseball, in a "V" shape. That "split-fingered" grip allows the pitcher to throw the ball with the exact same arm motion as a fastball -- only the result will be a slower pitch that dives down, or down and away.
Need a visual demonstration? Here, just watch Masahiro Tanaka.

They are two of the biggest stars in the game. And they will both be in Atlanta next week for the MLB All-Star Game presented by Mastercard.
But Aaron Judge of the Yankees and Pete Crow-Armstrong of the Cubs are first spending the weekend together at Yankee Stadium.
In the bottom of the fourth inning on Friday night, Crow-Armstrong launched a deep drive to right field on a 1-1 pitch from Carlos Rodón. Judge, inching back toward the wall, leaped at the last possible moment -- and took a home run away from the young Cubs sensation. It kept the score 3-0 Yankees.
And it also kept Judge with 34 home runs and Crow-Armstrong with 25.

Pitch Name: Four-seam fastball
Verbose Description: The fundamental pitch of baseball. It's straight, hard, and thrown with straight backspin. The spin resists gravity slightly longer, creating an optical illusion that the pitch is "exploding" upward past the hitter. Typical velocity is high, sometimes over 100 mph. Commonly thrown by pitchers like Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer.

Pitch Name: Two-seam fastball
Verbose Description: A variation of the fastball, similar in speed to a four-seamer but with lateral movement. It "tails" from left to right for a right-handed pitcher or right to left for a left-handed pitcher. The movement is caused by the grip and spin, and it makes the ball run toward the pitching arm side of the plate. Example: Yu Darvish's two-seamer.

Pitch Name: Sinker
Verbose Description: Another fastball variation grouped with the two-seamer. The sinker has more vertical drop than lateral movement. Thrown with similar speed as a four-seamer but designed to drop as it approaches the plate, making hitters swing over the ball. Example: Zack Britton's sinker.

Pitch Name: Cutter
Verbose Description: A fastball variant that "cuts" in the opposite direction of a two-seamer. From a right-handed pitcher, it moves from right to left; from a lefty, left to right. The cutter's movement is sharper and tighter, not wide or sweeping. It maintains fastball speed with subtle late break. Famously used by Kenley Jansen and Mariano Rivera.

Pitch Name: Slider
Verbose Description: A breaking ball characterized by both horizontal and vertical movement. The break is larger and more sweeping than a cutter, starting from the moment the pitch is released. Moves right to left for a right-handed pitcher. Thrown slower than a fastball, it combines sideways and downward action. Examples include Chris Archer and Chris Sale's sliders.

Pitch Name: Curveball
Verbose Description: A breaking ball known for its large, loopy movement. It travels up and then down in a pronounced arc, slower than a slider. The pitch can appear as though it will sail over the batter’s head before dropping sharply into the strike zone. Often described as looking like a rainbow. Clayton Kershaw's curveball is a well-known example.

Pitch Name: Changeup
Verbose Description: An offspeed pitch meant to look like a fastball but thrown slower to deceive the hitter. Its key feature is speed differential from the pitcher’s fastball. It also exhibits "fade" movement: some drop combined with arm-side horizontal movement. The grip and release cause it to tumble out of the pitcher’s hand. Felix Hernandez and Johan Santana are noted changeup throwers.

Pitch Name: Splitter (Split-fingered fastball)
Verbose Description: An offspeed pitch gripped with the index and middle fingers spread wide around the ball in a "V" shape. Although thrown with a fastball arm motion, it behaves like an offspeed pitch with a dramatic downward drop as it nears the plate. The defining visual is a fastball look that suddenly drops out of the zone, fooling hitters into swinging over it. Masahiro Tanaka is a noted splitter thrower.

Baseball Pitch Grips: The Ultimate Guide For Players & Coaches
June 2, 2025
Reading Time: 21 minutes

Baseball pitch grips set the foundation for every pitcher’s arsenal. New pitchers often start with a basic fastball grip. To be effective on the mound and keep hitters on their toes, you typically need more than one pitch. 

There’s a wide selection of pitch grips – ranging from a basic four-seam fastball to specialty pitches like a knuckleball. Because all baseballs are designed to a specific standard, the way a pitcher grips the ball impacts its spin direction, trajectory, and velocity. Finger positioning, pressure, depth, and dexterity determine the flight path of a pitch. 

You can alter the grip of any pitch, making small changes to affect movement and speed. Understanding not just how but why you grip the baseball a certain way is key to becoming a strategic, effective pitcher. 

When learning new pitch grips, practice and baseball pitching drills are essential. You don’t have to be on the mound to practice. Pick up a ball whenever you have spare time at home (or anywhere else) and practice new grips. Use a mirror to mimic your motion and release. As a coach, it’s important to set aside time in your baseball practice plans to work on grips with your pitching staff. 

This ultimate guide will teach you:

Different types of pitch grips
How to hold them
Grip variations, and
How to use them in game settings
Different Types of Baseball Pitch Grips 
A few different types of pitches are commonly taught to young players and new pitchers. When you reach the high school, college, and professional levels of baseball, you’ll see an expanded variation of pitch grips and pitch types. 



You can break most pitch grips into three categories: fastballs, off-speed pitches, and breaking balls. 

There’s overlap between the categories at times, but the different types of baseball pitch grips include: 

Fastballs
Four-seam fastball
Two-seam fastball (or sinker) 
Cutter
Off-speed pitches and breaking balls
Changeup 
Curveball
Slider

How To Grip Common Baseball Pitches 
Four-Seam Fastball


A four-seam fastball is the most basic baseball pitch grip and the first to teach young players new to pitching. 

Because there is little movement, command and velocity is the key to an effective four-seam fastball. A powerful, precise four-seamer serves as the core of a pitcher’s arsenal. 

How to grip a four-seam fastball

Place your index and middle fingers perpendicular across the c-shaped “horseshoe” with your fingertips slightly overtop the seams. 
For a basic four-seam fastball grip, your index and middle fingers are spread apart slightly. There should be roughly half-an-inch to an inch – about a finger’s width – of separation between the two. 
Your index and middle fingers have four points of contact with the “horseshoe” seam – the top of each finger touches the upper seam and the bottom of each finger touches the lower seam. 
Place your thumb beneath the ball, resting against the bottom seam directly underneath your index and middle fingers.
Your ring and pinky fingers rest lightly tucked on the outside of the baseball. 
Hold the ball with a relaxed grip to achieve maximum velocity. Your grip should be firm enough that you have control, but loose enough that you don’t choke it. 
Keep the ball in your fingers. Gripping with your palm – or holding the ball too deep in your fingers – will choke it and reduce your velocity. 
Four-seam fastball grip variations 

Hold the ball with the “horseshoe” facing either direction. For right-handed pitchers, that means the opening on the arm side (glove side for lefties) forming a proper “C” or the opening on the glove side (arm side for lefties), forming a backwards “C” shape. 
Change the space between your index and middle fingers. While the basic grip separates the two by a finger’s width, you can mess around with spacing. Try spreading them further apart or bringing them closer together. 
Place your fingertips directly on the seam instead of placing them just above. 
Thumb position can vary – either tucked further inside the ball or resting more on the outside. 
Grip depth varies based on hand size, comfort, and personal preference.


Tips for delivery and release 

As you deliver the pitch, pull down through the ball with your index and middle fingers to generate backspin. At the point of release, the index and middle fingertips should be the last point of contact with the ball. 

Pure back spin maximizes velocity and keeps the ball on a straight trajectory – key for a powerful, accurate delivery. 

How to use four-seam fastballs 

Use a four-seam fastball to get ahead of batters and set up the rest of your pitches. If you can locate a powerful and straight four-seamer, your secondary and off-speed pitches are more effective. 

A four-seam fastball is your go-to when you need a strike. If you’re behind in the count, rely on the accuracy and precision to climb back. It’s also useful when you’re ahead – a high four-seam fastball up and out of the zone can get the batter to chase. 

It’s important to learn to throw your four-seam fastball accurately to all parts of the strike zone – high, low, inside, and out. Complete command of this pitch enables you to work batters and control the game. 

Two-Seam Fastball (Sinker) 


A two-seam fastball – also known as a sinker – is a fastball variation that maintains velocity but incorporates movement. Some pitchers possess both a two-seam fastball and a sinker in their repertoire, each with different types of movement and grips. 

Two-seam fastballs typically possess either: 

Hard downward movement or drop
Horizontal arm-side movement, referred to as “arm-side run” or “tail”
A combination of both downward and lateral pitch movement
While it’s still one of the fastest pitches in a player’s pitch mix, two-seam fastballs are typically lower in velocity than four-seam fastballs. What you sacrifice in velocity, you gain in movement. 

How to grip a two-seam fastball

Place your index and middle fingers along the narrow seams of the baseball that run parallel at the top of the “horseshoe” seam. 
The “horseshoe” is vertically oriented in a two-seam grip, with the index finger placed along the inside seam and the middle finger along the outside seam. 
Place your thumb beneath the ball – similar to the placement on a four-seam fastball – with your ring and pinky fingers tucked to the outside once again. 
Finger pressure plays a role in the grip and effectiveness of your two-seamer. Increase the pressure of your index finger to create side-spin that causes the ball to drop and/or tail. 


Two-seam fastball and sinker grip variations

Alternatively grip across the seams or perpendicular instead of gripping along or with the seams.
Grip the wide “horseshoe” seam instead of the narrow seams if it’s more comfortable or to test movement.
Adjust the placement of your fingers slightly depending on hand size, personal preference, or other factors. 


Tips for delivery and release 

With pressure on your index finger, focus on pronating your wrist as you release down on the ball. That pronation – with your palm turning toward your arm-side – helps maximize the spin necessary for your ball to “tail” horizontally. 

If you’re looking to throw more of a sinker, don’t place as much emphasis on pronation. Focus more on releasing down on the ball. 

How to use two-seam fastballs

Because of the movement – either horizontal “tail” or “sinking” downward drop – two-seam fastballs are used to initiate weak contact and ground balls. Aim lower in the zone to try and create ground balls with this pitch. A two-seam fastball can induce a timely double play in situations with one or more runners on base. 

Leverage the arm-side run to jam batters that share your dominant hand or tail away from the opposite. 

Ex. A right-handed pitcher wants their two-seamer to tail inside and jam right-handed batters or tail outside and away from left-handed batters. 
A two-seam fastball can also be used as a strike out pitch or to fool batters into thinking it’s outside the zone. In this use-case, start your pitch outside of the strike zone and have it tail back in. Think of it as the opposite of the previous example. Instead of using arm-side run to jam batters, start your pitch on the edge of the opposite batters box (off the outer edge of the strike zone) and have it tail back into the strike zone. 

Ex. A right-handed pitcher facing a right-handed hitter starts the pitch on the edge of the left-hand batters box. The batter thinks it’s a fastball outside the zone, until it tails back across the outer-edge and into the strike zone. For a left-handed batter, it looks like the pitch is coming directly at their belt, until it tails back onto the inner-edge of the strike zone.
Cutter


A cutter grip is another fastball variation with late movement and elements of a breaking ball. The ball moves towards the pitcher’s glove side as it reaches the plate. As with a two-seamer, a cutter has slightly lower velocity than a four-seam fastball. It makes up for the loss of velocity with lateral movement. 

Depending on the velocity and movement, a cutter can look more like a hard slider than a fastball. If you’re looking for an effective bridge between fastball and breaking ball, a cutter is a great pitch to add to your arsenal. 

How to grip a cutter 

From a base fastball grip, move your middle and index fingers closer together and slightly off-center toward the outside of the baseball. 
Place your thumb beneath the ball, with your ring and pinky fingers tucked to the outside once again. 
Put more pressure on your middle finger to initiate spin that causes late glove-side break. 
Cutter grip variations

There are two main approaches to gripping a cutter, either positioning the ball like a four-seam or two-seam grip. Whichever variation you choose, the grip is similar. 
Slightly rotate or offset the ball positioning in your hand to affect the movement or cut. 
Tuck your thumb further underneath the ball to affect the movement. 


Tips for delivery and release 

Maintain the same motion and arm speed as your fastball. That stands true for all of these baseball pitch grips. To best disguise what you’re throwing, every repetition through your motion should look the same to the batter – whether a four-seam fastball or a knuckleball. 

As you release, focus on middle finger pressure and rotate your wrist ever-so-slightly toward your glove side. You want your middle finger to be the last point of contact with the ball. Think of it as throwing a regular four-seam fastball, but the pressure of your middle finger helps initiate a subtle, subconscious wrist rotation. 

You don’t want to force wrist rotation – you shouldn’t even think about it. If you twist aggressively or force too much rotation on the ball, you’ll lose velocity and delve into breaking ball territory. 

How to use a cutter

Use a cutter for late break away from batters that share your dominant hand, or break inside to batters with the opposite dominant hand. 

Ex. A right-handed pitcher throws a cutter that breaks away from a right-handed batter, or breaks inside to a left-handed batter. And the opposite for left-handed pitchers. 
A cutter serves two main purposes:

When it breaks away from the batter, it forces weak contact at the end of the bat and ground balls.
When it breaks towards the batter, it jams their hands and can break the bat if using wooden bats. 
Because they resemble the same pitch out of the hand, a cutter is a good pitch to keep batters honest with your fastball. This is especially true if batters catch onto your fastball and start to time it. Mix in a cutter and the late break will throw batters off their anticipation. 

Changeup 


The changeup is one of the most popular pitches in baseball and the first off-speed pitch to introduce young or inexperienced pitchers. Changeups are off-speed pitches that look like a fastball out of the hand but with significantly lower velocity.  Because they’re thrown with the same motion as a fastball, changeups are the safest off-speed pitch for young players to use. 

Though the difference in velocity is most important, changeups also move. A good changeup grip induces a touch of movement down and off to the arm side. This is often referred to as “fading” or “falling off the table” when describing a changeup’s movement. 

How to grip a changeup 

There is no “one-size-fits-all” changeup. That’s true about any pitch, but as we delve into off-speed and breaking pitches we’ll see more options for “base” grips or starting points. 

No matter the grip you opt for, all changeups require you hold the ball deeper in your hand. The depth – from slightly back in your fingers to all the way in your palm – and grip pressure (firm or loose) varies by player and preference. You can test out different combinations of grip depth and pressure to see how they impact velocity and movement.



Changeup grip variations

There are four “base” grip variations when it comes to changeups: fastball, five-finger, three-finger, and circle changeup. 

Fastball grip: Grip the ball like a fastball (four-seam or two-seam), but hold the ball tighter and deeper in your hand. This grip is the easiest to learn and most closely resembles your fastball, but the difference in velocity might not be enough to fool batters. 
Five-finger grip: Wrap all five fingers around the ball – either two-seam or four-seam alignment. Position your middle and ring fingers on top of the ball, pinky finger on the outside, index finger on the inside, and thumb on the bottom. 
Three-finger grip: Place your index, middle and ring fingers on the seams. Tuck your thumb underneath and rest your pink on the outside of the ball. 
Circle changeup: Place your middle and ring fingers on the seams – two-seam or four-seam orientation. Rest your pinky on the outside of the ball. Wrap your index finger and thumb on the inside of the ball, creating a circle.  


Tips for delivery and release

When throwing a changeup, use the same motion and arm speed as a fastball. As you finish your release you want subtle wrist pronation. Try to have your palm face out toward your arm side. This helps induce the “fading” movement of a changeup. 

You don’t want to force too much wrist rotation. That can affect your release, accuracy, and effectiveness. So don’t over-pronate – naturally release with your palm facing your arm side.



How to use a changeup 

Sometimes called a “contrast pitch”, changeups disrupt the hitter’s timing after facing fastball velocity. It can be used in any scenario after a fastball to force weak contact or swing and misses. 

If a player is sitting on your fastball, mixing in a changeup helps you deceive the batter and keep them honest. That can be the first pitch of an at-bat, after one or more hard hit foul balls, or anytime you notice a player timing your fastball. If you fall behind 1-0 or 2-0, mixing in a changeup can fool a batter that’s anticipating a “get me over” fastball. 

Changeups can be used as strikeout pitches, especially to batters of the opposite dominant hand. When properly located on the outside corner of the plate, the combined deception of a fastball lookalike and “fading” movement results in swing and misses as it falls off the table.

Curveball


Curveballs are one of the most popular secondary and off-speed pitches. A curveball is a breaking ball. The rotation is opposite of a fastball – instead of creating backspin, it creates top spin.

The goal is to get forward spin and depth, causing a sharp, downward breaking movement right before reaching home plate. A curveball should move late, hard, down, and potentially across the plate. It’s traditionally referred to as a 12-6 curveball, because the downward break travels in a similar trajectory as twelve o’clock to six o’clock on a clock. 

How to grip a curveball

Your curveball’s success relies on your grip. It’s key to master the grip so you get enough break while maintaining control of where you’re throwing. You can orient the ball like a four-seam or a two-seam grip. 

No matter the orientation of the ball, move your index and middle fingers closer together and slightly off-center toward the outside of the ball. 
Rest your thumb on the inside seam underneath the ball, with your ring and pinky fingers tucked on the outside of the ball. 
Apply slight pressure with your middle finger and thumb to squeeze the ball and help maximize spin. Because these fingers are placed on seams, you have a better grip to pull down and achieve proper spin. 
Curveball grip variations

An alternative version of the standard curveball is the spiked curve – sometimes referred to as the knuckle curve. The spiked curve can have more dramatic movement, breaking later and harder. 

Use the exact same finger placement as a regular curveball
Bend your index finger and press the fingertip (or knuckle) into the ball
Because the spiked curve is an advanced pitch, the exact grip will depend on the pitcher 


Tips for delivery and release 

You want to get in front of the ball and generate spin with your middle finger. When throwing a fastball, your palm faces the plate at your point of release. For a curveball, you want the top of your middle finger facing the plate. 

At your release point, roll your hand forward, snapping your wrist and arm down. Think of it as a shorter, chopping motion to pull down and create spin. This causes the downward drop. 

How to use a curveball

Your curveball affects hitters from two core components: change in velocity and movement. As an off-speed pitch, there’s a significant difference in velocity between a fastball and a curveball leading batters to swing too early. The downward movement causes hitters to swing over the top of the ball. 

Curveballs can be used at any point. You can throw them early in the count to surprise hitters, disrupt their timing, and get ahead. If a player is sitting on your fastball, mix in the curve to force weak contact or a swing and miss. 

When you’re ahead in the count, a curveball is a classic strikeout pitch. Because they’re defending the plate, the late break causes batters to chase outside of the zone. You can also start your curveball outside of the zone — especially if you have horizontal movement on yours – and cause batters to watch it break into the zone for a strikeout looking. 

Slurve


A hybrid secondary, off-speed pitch, the slurve bridges a gap between curveballs and sliders. The velocity of a slurve is somewhere between a fastball and a curveball. Combining horizontal and vertical break gives it the signature slider/curveball hybrid. 

How to grip a slurve 

You grip a slurve the same as your curveball. The difference in movement comes from your motion and release. 

Slurve grip variations

As with curveballs and sliders, there’s variation in how you grip the ball. 

Tips for delivery and release 

Instead of snapping your wrist and pulling down, you want to release at a diagonal motion. This leads to a combination of side spin and top spin. 

You still want to rotate your hand, but not as drastic of a snap. Think of it as throwing from the upper arm side to the lower glove side in a diagonal line. 

The key is to find a balance between throwing it harder like a slider, releasing with spin like a curveball, and using a diagonal angle to generate break down and out. 

How to use a slurve 

You can use a slurve in the same way you use a slider or curveball. 

Slider


A slider is another common secondary, off speed pitch combining the elements of a fastball and breaking ball. It tends to be faster than a curveball, but has less overall movement. Because it has a faster, sharp break, sliders can be confused as fastballs. 

It’s a pitch that bridges that gap between a cutter and a curveball. There’s more movement than a cutter and more velocity than a curveball. Pitchers that struggle with breaking ball command may opt for a slider over a curveball because it’s easier to control. 

How to grip a slider

Place your middle finger on the outside third of the ball, either on the seam or close to it. 
Your index finger sits next to your middle finger, with little to no space between the two.
Place your thumb on the inside seam underneath the ball, tucking your ring and pinky fingers on the outside of the ball. 
This grip is similar to the curveball grip, but with potentially more space between the index and middle fingers. 
Put a little bit of pressure on your index finger, middle finger, and thumb. 
Slider grip variations

Like curveballs, you can throw spiked sliders. Take the same finger placement you’re using and bend your index finger, pressing the fingertip or knuckle into the ball. 



Tips for delivery and release

When releasing a slider, slightly cock your wrist and think of throwing it like a football. That creates “bullet spin” which leads to late side-to-side break. 

The most important thing is that your motion and arm speed for a slider remain identical to that of a fastball. That way, you don’t tip off batters. 

How to use a slider

Because a slider has velocity and break, it’s used to deceive batters. Like all secondary pitches, sliders force weak contact or swings and misses. 

A slider can be used to set up a fastball or switch things up when a batter is timing your fastball. It’s a common strikeout pitch – when batters are behind in the count and protecting the plate, they’re more likely to chase a slider that breaks away late. 

Sweeper 


A sweeper is a secondary, off-speed pitch closely related to a slider. It has the same grip as a slider, but more total movement and less velocity. Because it’s so closely related, pitchers often possess either a sweeper or a slider. 

Due to the lower velocity and spin, a sweeper looks less like a fastball than a slider. The movement of the pitch throws hitters off balance. 

How to grip a sweeper 

Hold the baseball with the same grip you use for a slider 
Put more pressure on your middle finger than you would for a slider 
Sweeper grip variations

You can hold a sweeper more like a fastball, but with pressure on your middle finger 


Tips for release and delivery 

The key to an effective sweeper is your release. It’s here where you create sidespin that causes the “sweeping” horizontal movement. 

Your arm speed and motion are identical to a fastball. At release, rotate your hand so your thumb faces you and the back of your hand faces the catcher. 

How to use a sweeper 

You can use a sweeper the same way you use your other breaking balls. The movement initiates weak contact or swings and misses. 

To a batter that shares your dominant hand, the sweeper breaks away and leads to weak contact off the end of the bat. Hitters with opposite dominant hands get jammed inside by a sweeper, again forcing weak contact and potentially breaking the bat (if using wooden bats).

A sweeper is useful in multiple scenarios: 

Early in the count to fool a batter and get ahead 
Mixing it up to throw off a batter that’s timing your fastball
As a strikeout pitch, getting the batter to chase when they’re behind in the count and protecting the plate
Force a ground ball with one or more runners on base, inducing a double play
Splitter


A splitter, also called a split-finger fastball, is another secondary, off-speed pitch. Although it’s sometimes called a “fastball”, a splitter has movement and lower velocity. The velocity of a splitter is often between that of a fastball and a changeup. 

Splitters offer late, significant movement. The grip creates less spin, causing the ball to break down. Because of the grip, the ball drops suddenly and dramatically as it reaches home plate.  

Not every pitcher can throw a splitter. If you have small hands and short fingers, it can be a difficult pitch to throw because you need to get around the ball to have control. 

How to grip a splitter

With the ball oriented like a two-seam fastball, split your middle and index fingers on opposite sides of the ball to form a “V” formation or shape. 
Your index finger sits on the inside (glove side) of the ball with the middle finger on the outside (arm side). 
The amount of separation between fingers depends on the pitcher and personal preference 
The outside of your index finger and inside of your middle finger can touch the outer edge of the seams, or you can split them further apart so neither touches the seams. 


Splitter grip variations

You can modify how far back in your fingers and towards your palm you want to hold the ball. If you go too deep in your hand, you approach “forkball” territory (which we’ll cover in the next section). 

Tips for delivery and release 

Throw your splitter with the same arm speed, motion, and release as your fastball. Let the grip do the work. 

How to use a splitter

Use a splitter the same way you would a changeup or breaking ball. It’s another secondary pitch that looks like a fastball out of the hand but possesses the movement and difference in velocity of an off-speed pitch. 

The downward drop can lead batters to swing overtop and miss or initiate weak ground balls. 

Forkball


A forkball is similar to a splitter, but with a more dramatic downward break. Forkballs are less common than splitters in a pitcher’s repertoire. The grip is more difficult to master and it’s harder to control.

How to grip a forkball

Grip the ball the same way you would hold a splitter, but spread the index and middle fingers farther apart.
The outside of your index finger should be on the inside of the baseball. 
The inside of your middle finger should be on the outside of the baseball.
Neither finger should touch the laces
Push the ball far back in your fingers, as far as you feel comfortable


Forkball grip variations

Orient the baseball however you prefer. The only “grip variation” is how far back in your fingers to place the ball. You can also try throwing a forkball with your thumb off the ball. 



Tips for release and delivery

Use the same motion and arm speed as your fastball. At your release, you want to snap your wrist to create the downward movement.

How to use a forkball

A forkball is used similar to off-speed or breaking pitches. The dramatic movement and velocity difference throws off the batter’s timing. Like many off-speed pitches, a forkball can be used as a strikeout pitch, to force weak ground balls, or to set up a fastball. 

Some pitchers who lack velocity – or those later in their career who experience a dip in peak velocity – use a forkball remain competitive. 

Knuckleball


One of the rarest pitches in baseball, a knuckleball serves as a secondary, off-speed type of pitch. Knuckleballs have little-to-no spin, creating a fluttering motion with unpredictable movement. 

A knuckleball has a much lower velocity than most other pitches, but the erratic movement makes it extremely difficult to hit. The big part is movement. If your knuckleball doesn’t flutter unpredictably, it’s served up on a silver platter for batters to tee off on. 

How to grip a knuckleball

Hold the ball like a two-seam or four-seam fastball, whatever your preference
Bend your index and middle fingers, digging your fingernails or fingertips into the surface (either on the seams or just off)
Don’t grip too tight. You want to have a controlled grip but aren’t trying to push your fingertips or knuckles with any notable force. 
Knuckleball grip variations 

Some players have their knuckles on the ball, while others leave their knuckle hovering overtop.
You can place however many fingers you prefer on the ball. Some pitchers throw a two-finger knuckleball where others use four fingers.


Tips for release and delivery 

Use the same motion and arm speed as your fastball. At release, you want all fingers to let go of the ball at the same time. You can think of a “push” forward when releasing, but you don’t want to overthink the motion. Try to keep your wrist stiff up until your release. 

How to use a knuckleball

Many knuckleball pitchers use it as their primary pitch. Because of the unpredictable movement, difficulty to master, and lack of wear on the arm, many pitchers who possess a knuckleball use it exclusively. 

You can mix a knuckleball in with the rest of your arsenal, using it as you would any breaking pitch. 

Baseball Pitch Grip Variations 
In all of the baseball pitch grip descriptions, there are variations. That’s because there’s not always a one-size-fits-all approach to pitch grips. When learning a new grip or experimenting with your existing ones, consider testing the following variations for different movements and changes in velocity. 

Ball position and tilt 
Where you position the ball in your hand can greatly affect the pitch. Many of the base pitch grips start with a four-seam or two-seam position, but you can rotate – or tilt – the ball. 



Grip pressure 
How much pressure you place on your grip impacts the flight of the ball. If you grip a fastball as tight as possible, it won’t reach maximum velocity.

Grip pressure can be manipulated to change the movement of a pitch. Many of the breaking pitches emphasize pressure on certain fingers to initiate spin. You can test gripping with pressure on different fingers to adjust the break of your pitches. 

Thumb position 
Your thumb position – or where you place your thumb on the ball – can change the trajectory of a pitch. Some players prefer to keep their thumb underneath the ball for maximum control. 

Others like to tuck their thumb completely underneath and off the seam to create more movement. Another option is to rest your thumb on the outside of the baseball. 



Grip depth 
Depth of grip is about comfort and preference. It’s how deep you hold the ball in your fingers or hand. The deeper the grip, the less velocity.

You can test different depths for all baseball pitch grips, especially off-speed and breaking pitches. Some pitchers throw their changeup with the same grip but varying depth to achieve different velocities. 



FAQs About Baseball Pitch Grips 
What are the different pitch grips in baseball?
Numerous pitch grips exist in baseball, though there are a handful of common grips that most pitchers learn. Typically, common pitch grips are grouped into fastballs, off-speed pitches, and breaking balls.

Some of the most common baseball pitch grips include: 

Four-seam fastball
Two-seam fastball (or sinker) 
Changeup (or circle changeup) 
Curveball
Slider
What is the best grip to throw a baseball?
The best grip to throw a baseball is the four-seam grip. This grip keeps the ball on a straight trajectory and gives players the most control. The straight path and ability to control the ball make it easy for fielders to throw accurately to their intended target. 

What is the most accurate fastball grip?
The most accurate fastball grip is the four-seam fastball. A four-seam fastball is the most basic fastball grip, with a straight trajectory and full control of the ball. Where other fastballs offer slight movement, a four-seam fastball travels straight toward the intended target. The finger placement offers more control than any other grip. 

What is the difference between a slider and a curveball grip?
While curveballs and sliders have similar grips, there are a few differences. The most prominent difference between a curveball and slider grip is that you put less pressure on your middle finger and leave more space between your index and middle fingers. 

Your release plays more of an impact than grip in differentiating a slider and curveball. Curveballs involve snapping the wrist and rotating your hand, while a slider involves more of a wrist cock.

Pitch Name: Four-seam fastball
Alternate Names: 4-seam fastball
Verbose Description: The most basic and fundamental pitch in baseball, known for its straight trajectory and maximum velocity. It’s gripped with the index and middle fingers placed across the horseshoe seam, thumb underneath. The grip and release create pure backspin, allowing the ball to resist gravity slightly longer and sometimes appear to rise. Four-seam fastballs are typically the most accurate and are used to get ahead in counts or challenge hitters with speed. Variations include adjusting finger spacing, grip depth, and seam orientation.

Pitch Name: Two-seam fastball
Alternate Names: Sinker
Verbose Description: A fastball variant that incorporates movement along with speed. Thrown slightly slower than a four-seam fastball but with tailing horizontal and/or downward movement. The grip uses the two parallel seams (narrow seams on the baseball). The pitcher can adjust finger pressure and wrist pronation to increase run (tail) or drop (sink). Some pitchers distinguish between a two-seamer and a sinker by intent or subtle grip differences, but they are often grouped together. Used to induce weak contact and ground balls.

Pitch Name: Cutter
Alternate Names: Cut fastball
Verbose Description: A fastball variant that combines elements of a breaking ball. It moves late toward the pitcher’s glove side with sharp, tight horizontal break. Gripped similar to a four-seam fastball but with the fingers placed slightly off-center and more pressure on the middle finger. Arm motion mimics a fastball to deceive hitters. Used to break bats, jam hitters, and disrupt timing. Famously used by Mariano Rivera.

Pitch Name: Slider
Verbose Description: A breaking ball that bridges the gap between a cutter and a curveball. It has sharper, quicker horizontal break than a curveball and is thrown faster. Gripped with the middle finger on the outside third of the ball, the index finger beside it, thumb underneath. Variations include the spiked slider. The release involves wrist cocking similar to throwing a football, producing "bullet spin." Sliders are often used as strikeout pitches and to fool batters expecting a fastball.

Pitch Name: Sweeper
Alternate Names: Sweeping slider
Verbose Description: A variation of the slider with more exaggerated horizontal movement and less velocity. Thrown with the same grip as a slider but with more middle finger pressure and adjusted wrist action at release. The sweeper is designed to break farther across the plate than a standard slider, with arm speed that mimics a fastball. Used to initiate weak contact or swings and misses, particularly against same-handed batters.

Pitch Name: Curveball
Alternate Names: 12-6 curveball, Spiked curve, Knuckle curve
Verbose Description: A classic breaking ball known for its top-spin and significant downward break. Gripped with fingers close together on the seams, thumb underneath. Variants include the spiked curve or knuckle curve, where the index finger is bent. The release involves snapping the wrist downward, creating a "12-6" break. Used to change speed and induce weak contact or strikeouts. It’s slower than a slider, with a loopy, rainbow-like trajectory.

Pitch Name: Slurve
Verbose Description: A hybrid pitch combining characteristics of a slider and a curveball. Thrown with a curveball grip but released with a diagonal wrist angle, creating both horizontal and vertical break. The slurve’s velocity is between that of a slider and curveball. It’s used to confuse batters with its dual-plane break and can replace either a slider or curveball in a pitcher’s repertoire.

Pitch Name: Changeup
Alternate Names: Circle changeup, Three-finger changeup, Five-finger changeup
Verbose Description: An off-speed pitch meant to mimic a fastball’s appearance but thrown at lower velocity to disrupt timing. Gripped deeper in the hand than a fastball. There are multiple grip variations:
- Fastball grip changeup: standard fastball grip but deeper and tighter.
- Circle changeup: index finger and thumb create a circle, middle and ring fingers control the ball.
- Three-finger changeup: index, middle, and ring fingers on top.
- Five-finger changeup: all five fingers in contact with the ball.
All changeups have arm-side fade and some drop, designed to make hitters swing early and miss or make weak contact.

Pitch Name: Splitter
Alternate Names: Split-finger fastball
Verbose Description: An off-speed pitch gripped with a wide spread between the index and middle fingers forming a “V.” Thrown with fastball arm speed, but the ball drops sharply as it reaches the plate due to reduced spin. Velocity is between a fastball and a changeup. The splitter is difficult to throw for players with smaller hands. It’s used to fool batters by looking like a fastball before dropping out of the zone for swing-and-miss or weak ground balls.

Pitch Name: Forkball
Verbose Description: A more extreme version of the splitter with an even wider finger spread and deeper grip. Fingers are placed farther apart and pushed deeper into the ball. The forkball has a more dramatic downward drop than a splitter but is harder to control. Thrown with fastball arm speed, it’s used to create off-speed deception and induce weak contact or strikeouts. Forkballs are rare due to the difficulty of the grip.

Pitch Name: Knuckleball
Verbose Description: A rare, off-speed pitch characterized by little-to-no spin, creating unpredictable, fluttering movement. Gripped by digging the fingertips or knuckles into the ball. There are several variations, including two-finger, four-finger, and hovering knuckle grips. Released with a stiff wrist and equal finger pressure, all fingers let go simultaneously. The knuckleball’s primary value is its erratic motion, making it difficult to hit despite very low velocity. Often used as a primary pitch by knuckleball specialists.

Keep a pitch's name and alternative names on the same line; separate with "/". Also, don't differentiate between numerals and the written form of the numeral -- use the numerical form (e.g., use "4-Seam Fastball"; don't use Four-Seam Fastball").

Good. Try to include individual steps in how to perform every step of every pitch for future compare/contrast purposes. Keep the instructions for steps in (as close as possible to) the same order for every respective pitch, separating aspects so they can later be mixed and matched for both analysis and experimentation purposes.

If an alternative pitch name is nearly the same as the proper pitch name, use the more casual version (for example, use "4-Seamer" and not "4-Seam Fastball"). On that note, you don't have include the "Fastball" part on individual pitches -- as long as the pitch is in the correct section, the reader will know it's a type of Fastball.

Imagine you're writing this list as a guide for a Little League player to follow in order to learn the pitches and learn the individual parts of each pitch so they have a sense of the "language" well enough to make adjustments to parts of each pitch to customize them for the current batter -- this means modularizing on a small enough scale to mix and match as the current batter requires, but also keeping the tone, organization, and vernacular simple and concise enough that a young man/young woman who's 12 years old or younger can understand and practice routinely. Take your time -- this is a complicated task and I want you to consider every possible aspect of it. If you think any particular source of info would be helpful to empower you to accomplish this task, tell me what you need and I'll try to find it for you. I, and my son, and counting on you.

Heads-up for young pitchers & parents

The Pitch Smart guidelines from MLB and USA Baseball say players ages 9-12 should focus on fastballs and change-ups and hold off on heavier breaking stuff until the body is stronger.
MLB.com

That means the 4-Seamer, 2-Seamer, and Change-Up are your safe everyday pitches. Feel free to read about the others here, but only try them with a qualified coach once you’re older.

Category: Off-Speed Pitches

Pitch Name: Change-Up / Circle Change / 3-Finger Change / 5-Finger Change
1 Seams however feels comfy (4- or 2-seam)
2 Circle: make “OK” sign; or cover ball with 3 or 5 fingers up top
3 Thumb under or just off center
4 Squeeze a little deeper into the hand to slow it down
5 Throw exactly like a fastball
6 Let the palm turn slightly toward arm side (natural pronation)
7 Fingers roll off; middle & ring finish last
8 Slower with arm-side “fade”—best friend after you’ve shown your heater

Pitch Name: Knuckleball (RARE / SPECIALTY)
1 Seams don’t matter much
2 Tip-joints or knuckles of 2-4 fingers poke into surface
3 Thumb rests underneath or off the ball
4 Gentle grip—no twist
5 Smooth, easy arm motion
6 Keep wrist stiff—no snap
7 Push ball forward; fingers release together
8 Little to no spin—ball flutters unpredictably; master only with lots of practice

HOW TO PRACTICE

• Warm Up – Jog, stretch, then throw easy before any pitching.
• Bull-Pen Routine – Pick one pitch, throw 5–10 reps of each step slowly (grip, wrist, release) before throwing at full speed.
• Mix & Match – Need more drop? Keep Step 6 the same but tweak Step 2 (finger spots) on your change-up. Want more run? Hold 2-Seamer but add a little more Step 6 pronation.
• Log Your Work – Write which steps you changed and how the ball moved.
• Rest & Limits – Follow pitch-count rules and rest days; your arm grows with you.

Have fun, throw smart, and remember: every pitch starts with a good 4-Seamer!

**Practice Plan for Kids**

1. **Warm-Up** – light jog, arm circles, easy catch.  
2. **Drill** – choose one pitch, walk through Steps 1-4 slowly, then Steps 5-8 at 50 % speed, then full speed.  
3. **Notebook** – jot which step you tweaked and how the ball moved.  
4. **Pitch Counts** – follow Little League limits; rest your arm.  
5. **Have Fun** – master the 4-Seamer first; every other pitch is just a remix of the eight steps!

Okay I'm going to add more sources. Keep incorporating any new info or alternative perspectives from the new sources. It's okay to be verbose so long as we only add info and not lose any info to incorporate the new info/perspectives. I have no problem with too much info for now because the more info/perspectives we have now, the more thorough and comprehensive choices we have when we're again streamlining the guide for Little Leaguers to use in a later step. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to gain and gather knowledge right now. Here's the next source:

BASEBALL PITCHES ILLUSTRATED


A fan's guide to identifying pitches

I'm a baseball fan. I've watched my share of televised games and attended a few handful. After all this, I was still in the dark about the difference between pitches. I knew a curveball broke downwards, but what exactly was a circle changeup?

The diagrams below are the results of skimming through baseball books and doing online research. This is not a complete guide. I've picked twelve of the more common pitches:

Fastballs: Four-seam, Two-seam, Cutter, Splitter, and Forkball
Breaking Balls: Curveball, Slider, Slurve, and Screwball
Changeups: Changeup, Palmball, Circle Changeup
Learning to identify pitches

The list of pitches might seem like a lot to keep track of, but remember that each pitcher utilizes only a selection of these pitches. For example, Pedro Martinez throws a curveball, circle-changeup, an occasional slider, and a fastball. Do a little research on the pitcher before the game.

Things to watch for that will help you identify a pitch:

Speed
Movement - the general direction the ball is moving
Break - a sudden shift in direction
There are a few other things that can help you identify a pitch: ball rotation, point of release, and grip. For a casual fan though, it might be a bit much and I don't illustrate or discuss any of the latter three items.

Reading the diagrams

Take note of the speed, movement, and break of the ball. Don't worry about where the baseball is shown in the the strike zone. You can throw a fastball in the middle of the strike-zone like the one illustrated, or you can throw one high and away from the batter. It's still a fastball. Location doesn't determine the pitch.


Four-seam Fastball

85-100 mph

Fastest, straightest pitch. Little to no movement.


Two-seam Fastball

80-90 mph

Also known as a Sinker. Moves downward, and depending on the release, will sometimes run in on a right handed hitter (RHH).


Cutter

85-95 mph

Breaks away from a right handed hitter (RHH) as it reaches the plate. Mix of a slider and a fastball. Faster than a slider but with more movement than a fastball.


Splitter

80-90 mph

Breaks down suddenly before reaching plate.


Forkball

75-85 mph

Like a splitter, but with a less dramatic, more gradual downward movement.


Curveball

70-80 mph

Commonly called a 12-6 curveball. The 12-6 refers to the top to bottom movement (picture a clock with hands at 12 and 6).


Slider

80-90 mph

Breaks down and away from a RHH. Between a fastball and a curve.


Slurve

70-80 mph

11-5 movement. Similar to a curve but with more lateral movement.


Screwball

65-75 mph

1-7 movement. Opposite of the slurve.


Changeup

70-85 mph

Slower than a fastball, but thrown with the same arm motion.


Palmball

65-75 mph

Ball is gripped tightly in palm. Just like a changeup, this pitch is slower than a fastball, but thrown with the same arm motion.


Circle Changeup

70-80 mph

A changeup with 1-7 moment like the screwball.

STEP LEGEND  (uniform eight-part “mix-and-match” recipe)

i     SEE THE SEAMS      – how the horseshoe “C” sits in your hand  
ii    FINGER SPOTS       – pointer & middle finger landings  
iii   THUMB SPOT         – where the thumb supports the ball  
iv    GRIP SQUEEZE       – how tight or loose to hold it  
v     ARM PATH           – overall throwing motion  
vi    WRIST MOVE         – twist / pronation / snap details  
vii   LET-GO CUE         – which finger leaves last, verbal cue if helpful  
viii  BALL PATH & USE    – movement, mph window, game purpose  

CATEGORY: FASTBALLS

I 4-SEAMER
i seams sideways across fingers
ii pointer & middle across seam, thumb-width apart
iii thumb under center
iv light grip—don’t choke it
v full-speed throw
vi wrist straight

iii thumb wraps around bottom edge
iv very loose finger tips; palm does the work to kill speed
v arm speed mimics fastball
vi little or no wrist action
vii ball oozes out of palm; full hand releases together
viii 65–75 mph. SUPER-SLOW change variant—minimal spin, gentle sink; great timing disruptor.

### Extra perspective just added from the new fan guide
- **Speed windows** now accompany every Step viii for quick visual ID.  
- **Clock-face language** (12-6, 11-5, 1-7) included for break direction.  
- **Screwball** and **Palmball** join the roster with full eight-step recipes.  
- For the *2-Seamer* we clarified the “also called Sinker” note, and for *Forkball* we emphasized its smoother, longer drop versus the Splitter’s sudden chop.  
- Movement notes now specify “toward RHH” / “away from RHH” concepts implicitly via clock or glove/arm-side wording.

Feel free to feed more sources—everything will keep stacking into this master list before we trim it for 12-year-old clarity later on.

Use punctuation to make the writing more comprehensible. Also, use typical numerals (indented) instead of roman numerals for the steps to each pitch (with a period after each numeral). Also put a period after each UPPERCASE ROMAN NUMERAL for each listed pitch.

I.  Four-Seamer  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Horseshoe is sideways across the fingers.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Pointer and middle lie straight across the seam, thumb-width apart.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Thumb rests under the center of the ball.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Light; don’t choke it.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Full-speed fastball motion.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Keep wrist straight.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – Snap straight down; pointer and middle fingers leave last.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 90–100 mph; flies straight with a slight “rise” illusion. Primary strike pitch or “high heat.”  

II.  Two-Seamer  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Horseshoe is upright; two narrow seams on top.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Pointer rides inner seam; middle rides outer seam.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Centered under the ball.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Light, with extra pinch on the pointer.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Standard fastball motion.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Tiny inward turn (pronation).  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – Pointer finger finishes last.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 80–94 mph; arm-side run or sink (called a *Sinker* when drop is main feature). Great for ground balls and jamming like-handed hitters.  

III. Cutter

    7.  LET-GO CUE – Both fingers release together.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 80–90 mph; sudden late drop for strikeouts or weak contact. (Advanced.)  

V.  Forkball  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Any comfortable alignment.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Pointer and middle even wider; ball buried deep.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Under or slightly off to the side.

    7.  LET-GO CUE – Full hand releases together.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 65–75 mph; gentle sink, maximum timing disruption.  

III. Knuckleball – A slow fluttering pitch of pure chaos. Use it only if you can control it and want to keep hitters totally guessing.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Seams are irrelevant.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Tips or knuckles of 2–4 fingers press into the surface.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Supports underneath or off to the side.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Gentle; no twist.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Smooth, easy motion.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Stiff; avoid snapping.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – Push ball forward; all gripping fingers leave together.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 60–70 mph; near-zero spin and unpredictable flutter.

BASEBALL PITCHES ILLUSTRATED


A fan's guide to identifying pitches

I'm a baseball fan. I've watched my share of televised games and attended a few handful. After all this, I was still in the dark about the difference between pitches. I knew a curveball broke downwards, but what exactly was a circle changeup?

The diagrams below are the results of skimming through baseball books and doing online research. This is not a complete guide. I've picked twelve of the more common pitches:

Fastballs: Four-seam, Two-seam, Cutter, Splitter, and Forkball
Breaking Balls: Curveball, Slider, Slurve, and Screwball
Changeups: Changeup, Palmball, Circle Changeup
Learning to identify pitches

The list of pitches might seem like a lot to keep track of, but remember that each pitcher utilizes only a selection of these pitches. For example, Pedro Martinez throws a curveball, circle-changeup, an occasional slider, and a fastball. Do a little research on the pitcher before the game.

Things to watch for that will help you identify a pitch:

Speed
Movement - the general direction the ball is moving
Break - a sudden shift in direction
There are a few other things that can help you identify a pitch: ball rotation, point of release, and grip. For a casual fan though, it might be a bit much and I don't illustrate or discuss any of the latter three items.

Reading the diagrams

Take note of the speed, movement, and break of the ball. Don't worry about where the baseball is shown in the the strike zone. You can throw a fastball in the middle of the strike-zone like the one illustrated, or you can throw one high and away from the batter. It's still a fastball. Location doesn't determine the pitch.


Four-seam Fastball

85-100 mph

Fastest, straightest pitch. Little to no movement.


Two-seam Fastball

80-90 mph

Also known as a Sinker. Moves downward, and depending on the release, will sometimes run in on a right handed hitter (RHH).


Cutter

85-95 mph

Breaks away from a right handed hitter (RHH) as it reaches the plate. Mix of a slider and a fastball. Faster than a slider but with more movement than a fastball.


Splitter

80-90 mph

Breaks down suddenly before reaching plate.


Forkball

75-85 mph

Like a splitter, but with a less dramatic, more gradual downward movement.


Curveball

70-80 mph

Commonly called a 12-6 curveball. The 12-6 refers to the top to bottom movement (picture a clock with hands at 12 and 6).


Slider

80-90 mph

Breaks down and away from a RHH. Between a fastball and a curve.


Slurve

70-80 mph

11-5 movement. Similar to a curve but with more lateral movement.


Screwball

65-75 mph

1-7 movement. Opposite of the slurve.


Changeup

70-85 mph

Slower than a fastball, but thrown with the same arm motion.


Palmball

65-75 mph

Ball is gripped tightly in palm. Just like a changeup, this pitch is slower than a fastball, but thrown with the same arm motion.


Circle Changeup

70-80 mph

A changeup with 1-7 moment like the screwball.

How to Throw a 4-seam Fastball (Grips, Cues, Types, etc.)


Welcome back to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even a top MLB comparison for reference when looking at a given pitch. Next up, how to throw a 4-seam fastball.

Overview



The 4-seam fastball is typically the “staple” of a pitcher’s arsenal. From youth to professional athletes, pitchers at all levels commonly throw a 4-seam fastball. It is often the fastest pitch that a pitcher will throw. In addition, it will maintain a good amount of vertical break (VB) and slight amounts of horizonal break (HB). The more separation between the two, favoring the vertical break will be the most advantageous for this pitch. Obviously, the amount of break in the vertical and horizontal plane will be dependent on the arm slot.

Although we will dive into this topic more later on in the article, it is important to state that the most effective 4-seam fastballs maintain high degrees of induced VB which causes the pitch to “carry” or “jump” on the hitter more than they would expect it to. Higher degrees of induced VB can cause more swings and misses, fly outs, and pop ups compared to other pitches.

Desired Movement Profile

Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a better 4-seam fastball, let’s continue to discuss how we want this pitch to move. Typically, depending on the arm slot, we look for 15+ inches of VB on a 4-seam fastball. However, can ELITE 4-seam fastball will maintain 18 or more inches of VB. In addition, we typically look for <10 inches of HB with this pitch.



So what are some factors that can help you increase your VB on your 4-seam fastball?

Changes to the spin axis
Increased spin efficiency
By being aware of your spin axis when throwing the 4-seam fastball, it could allow you to get more “on top” of the baseball. Being more “on top” will allow you to increase the true backspin and overall spin efficiency of the pitch. These two metrics can both positively increase induced VB on your 4-seam fastball. By increasing induced VB on your 4-seam fastball, it could result in:

Generate more swings and misses
Generate more flyouts and pop ups
Creating a “carry” or “jump” effect that can catch hitters off-guard
Ideal 4-seam Fastball Location on a Movement Chart

A movement chart is a tool that players and coaches can use to analyze the ideal movement and placement of a given pitch.



What each zone represents:

The grey circle in the center of the chart represents the “gyro zone” which is no movement in either the vertical or horizontal plane
The upper right quadrant represents positive vertical movement and positive horizontal movement
The upper left-hand quadrant represents positive vertical movement and negative horizontal movement
The lower right-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and positive horizontal movement
The lower left-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and negative horizontal movement
The chart pictured above is representative of a right-handed pitcher’s ideal placement for each pitch. This puts the 4-seam fastball in the upper right-hand quadrant as the most ideal location for amount of movement. For lefties, the VB would stay the same. But the horizontal movement that would be desired would have negative value. Therefore, making the upper left-hand quadrant as the most ideal for a left-handed 4-seam fastball.

4-seam Fastball Grip

Now let’s dive into how to grip the 4-seam fastball. The grip for the 4-seam fastball is pretty standard:

The index and middle finger will be placed on top of the baseball, with the fingertips slightly over the seams of the horseshoe
The ring and pinky finger will be off to the side
The thumb positioning will be flat or tucked – depending on preferred feel and how it influences induced VB
Horseshoe will either be to the inside or outside – depending on preferred feel and how it influences induced VB
Below are several variations for the 4-seam fastball grip we use with our athletes:

Grip 1 – Horseshoe inside w/ flat thumb



Grip 2- Horseshoe inside w/ tucked thumb



Grip 3- Horseshoe outside w/ flat thumb



Grip 4- Horseshoe outside w/ tucked thumb



Cues to Help you Throw a 4-seam Fastball

Let’s start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!!

There are many different cues that people use when teaching pitchers how to throw each pitch. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your 4-seam fastball more effectively.  Some of the cues we use with our athletes are:

“Stay behind the ball”
“Get on top of it”
“Rip the seams straight down”
“Set your sights high”


What we like to see:

A spin efficiency of 90% or higher (the higher the spin efficiency the better)
No specific spin axis (because pitchers use different arm slots)
Relatively consistent spin axis
Good command around the zone
Hardest pitch in your arsenal
What we don’t like to see:

Spin efficiency under 80%
Getting the “cut action” or glove-side movement
Somewhat inconsistent spin-axis
Somewhat inconsistent spin-efficiency from pitch-to-pitch (the more inconsistent the spin-axis and spin-efficiency, the more inconsistent the break, implying less overall command of the pitch)
Tunneling tips and When, Where to Throw a 4-seam Fastball

Being a staple in a pitcher’s arsenal, it’s important to be able to effectively tunnel this pitch with the off-speed pitches in your arsenal and create deception against the hitter. The 4-seam fastball tunnels well off the following: Cutters, Curveballs, Gyro sliders, Dropping change-ups and Splitters.

All of these pitches operate in the vertical plane or have lesser vertical movement than the 4-seam fastball. Thus, they will tunnel well out of the pitcher’s release and eventually move in a different direction than the 4-seam fastball. This deception will allow the pitcher to disrupt the hitters timing at the plate.



Elite MLB 4-seam fastball

Carlos Rodon is a great example of someone who throws an ELITE 4-seam fastball. Last year, Rodon had one of the best 4-seam fastballs in all of baseball. Coming in at 95+ MPH with a ton of induced VB, Rodon used this elite pitch 61% of the time in 2022. Rodon’s 4-seam fastball produced a .213 BA, .284 wOBA, 27.9 whiff %, and 24.1 K %. He is a great example to look at when trying to emulate an ELITE 4-seam fastball.

How to Throw a Sinker or 2-seam (Grips, Cues, Types, etc.)


Welcome back to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even top MLB comparisons for reference when looking at a given pitch. Next up, how to throw a sinker or 2-seam.

Overview



The sinker and 2-seam are both classified as “fastballs” due to the similarity in velocity to the 4-seam. However, they are different due to the amount of side spin these pitches have compared to the 4-seam. This differentiation in added side spin will cause the sinker and 2-seam to “run” and “dive”. The sinker and 2-seam are two variations of a very similar pitch. Sinkers and 2-seam will typically possess similar amounts of horizonal break and “arm side run”. However, a sinker pitch will have less vertical break than the 2-seam causing it to appear more like its “diving” or “sinking” as opposed to the 2-seam that “runs” or “rides”.

In this article, we will be taking a deep dive into a few different grips and cues to help you throw your sinker and 2-seam more effectively and efficiently.

Desired Movement Profile

Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a sinker and 2-seam, let’s review how we want this pitch to move.

As we have discussed already, sinkers and 2-seam will have more horizontal break to the pitcher’s arm side than a 4-seam. We ideally look for 15+ inches of HB. The differentiator between these two pitches will be the amount of vertical break the pitch has. Ideally, both pitches will possess substantially less vertical break than the 4-seam within your arsenal. Typically, a 2-seam will have around 10 inches of VB whereas the sinker will have < 10 inches of VB (often between 5-9).

Example of Sinker Movement



Example of 2-seam Movement



Ideal Sinker and 2-seam Location on a Movement Chart 

A movement chart is a tool that players and coaches can use to analyze the ideal movement and placement of a given pitch.



What each zone represents:

The grey circle in the center of the chart represents the “gyro zone” which is no movement in either the vertical or horizontal plane.
The upper right quadrant represents positive vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The upper left-hand quadrant represents positive vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The lower right-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The lower left-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The chart pictured above is representative of a right-handed pitcher’s ideal placement for each pitch. A sinker pitch or 2-seam are pitches you want to “run”, “dive”, or “sink” out of the pitcher’s hand. This means it will have positive horizontal break towards the pitcher’s arm-side and maintain some degree of positive vertical break as well. This puts the upper right-hand quadrant as the most ideal for right-handed sinker and 2-seam.

For lefties, the vertical break would stay the same. But the horizontal movement that would be desired would have negative value. Therefore, making the upper left-hand quadrant the most ideal for a left-handed sinker and 2-seam.

Sinker and 2-Seam Grips

Due to the similarities between the sinker and 2-seam, the grips utilized to throw these pitches often overlap. The differentiator between getting sinker movement vs. 2-seam movement will come from how you release the pitch.

Grip #1: Standard

For this grip, the athlete will grip the baseball inside the seams pictured below with their pointer and middle fingers. The thumb should be placed directly underneath the baseball opposite these fingers. The ring and pinky finger should be tucked off to the side.



Grip #2: On-seam

For this grip, the athlete will grip the baseball with the same fingers and along the same seams as the standard grip. The only difference will be that the fingers will rest on the seams, instead of inside them. This grip can give the athlete a different feel from the traditional 4-seam which can help differentiate the release of the pitch as well.



Grip #3: Off-set

For this grip, the athlete will grip the baseball with the same fingers and along the same seams as the standard grip. The only difference will be that the ball will rest offset slightly to the traditional grip. This grip can give the athlete more of a seam to rip off and create more middle finger pressure during release. Both of these added feels can help the athlete create more movement on this pitch.



Cues to Help You Throw a Sinker or 2-seam

Let’s start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!

There are several different cues that one can use when teaching pitchers how to throw each pitch. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your pitch more effectively.

As mentioned earlier, the goal when throwing a sinker or 2-seam is to generate side spin. The side spin is what will help the pitch move more within the horizonal plane. With some athletes, applying different finger pressure will naturally allow them to create this side spin, and sometimes it takes a verbal cue to allow the athlete to feel how this pitch is supposed to be released.

Some cues that we use with our guys are:

Throw the pitch with more pointer finger pressure
Swipe the ball leading with your pointer finger
Feel your fingers coming off the ball horizontally (compared to vertically with a 4-seam)
Throw your sinker or 2-seam with a similar feel to your change-up


Sinker (left) vs. 2-seam (right)

 Sinker or 2-seam Data

 What we like… What we don’t like… (Specifically for athletes who have access to data tracking devices such as Rapsodo, Trackman, Pitch Logic, etc.)

What we like to see:

More horizontal and less vertical movement compared to 4-seam
More tilt on spin-axis vs. 4-seam
Relatively consistent spin axis from pitch-to-pitch
Needs to have a different “break path” than our 4-seam
What we do not like to see:

A pitch that too closely resembles the 4-seam (in terms of movement)
Path that stays straight, or cut action on it
Tunneling Tips – When and Where to Throw a Sinker or 2-seam

 The sinker plays well off of the following off-speed pitches:

“Running” changeups
“Gyro” sliders
Splitters


Sinker Overlay

The 2-seam plays well off of the following off-speed pitches:

“Running” changeups
“Sweeping” sliders


2-seam Overlay

All these pitches operate on the horizontal plane and try to limit vertical movement and capitalize on increased amounts of horizonal movement. This means that it will be easier for the pitcher to tunnel these pitches out of release and create a sense of deception to fool the hitter.

Sinkers, having more “dive” will play better of the “gyro” slider and splitter which also have more downward movement. And the 2-seam, having more “run” will play better of the “running” changeup and “sweeping” slider which have more lateral movement.

Throwing sinkers or 2-seam before or after these off-speed pitches could trick the hitter into guessing the wrong pitch is coming. This could be advantageous when trying to fool hitters.

Elite MLB Examples

Sinker

Clay Holmes throws an ELITE sinker pitch. In 2022, Holmes threw his sinker 80% of the time. Coming in at 97-100 MPH, with some serious “dive” and “sink”, it profiles as one of the best sinkers in all of baseball. In 2022, Holmes’ sinker produced .200 BA, .257 wOBA, 26.3 whiff%, and 22.7 K%. Holmes plays his sinker off of a devastating gyro slider which causes major timing issues for hitters.



 2-seam

Dustin May throws an ELITE 2-seam. In 2022, May threw this pitch 28.9% of the time. (Highest usage in his arsenal.) Coming in as high as 101 MPH, with ridiculous run, it profiles as one of the best in all of baseball. In 2022, this pitch produced a .200 BA, .319 wOBA, 14.8 whiff%, and 21.4 K%.

How to Throw a Cutter (Grips, Cues, Movement, Types, etc.)


Welcome back to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even a top MLB comparison for reference when looking at a given pitch. Next up, how to throw a Cutter.



Overview

The cutter, a variation of the 4SFB, is a pitch that relies on a combination of backspin and gyro spin. By combining backspin and gyro spin, the pitch will move similarly to a 4SFB out of the pitcher’s hand, and eventually “cut” a few inches horizontally towards the pitcher’s glove side.

Generally speaking, a cutter will be thrown 3-6 mph slower than the 4SFB. The cutter isn’t considered an “off – speed” pitch due to the smaller discrepancy in velocity to the 4SFB compared to a pitch such as a curveball.

Ideally, when throwing both the 4SFB and cutter in your arsenal, the ability to tunnel both pitches is very desirable due to the similarities of the pitches out of the pitcher’s hand during ball release. However, some pitchers rely on the cutter as their primary fastball (Such as Corbin Burnes), and some use it later in counts to try and throw off hitters timing and generate strike outs. (Such as Kenley Jansen)



In this article, we will be taking a deep dive into a few different cutter grips and cues to help you throw your cutter more effectively and efficiently.

Desired Movement Profile

Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a better cutter, lets continue to discuss how we want this pitch to move.

Like we spoke about earlier, we look for the cutter to maintain backspin, while incorporating gyro spin into the mix as well. This means we will be looking for the pitch to maintain (+) vertical break, while also having a few inches of horizontal break towards the pitcher’s glove side.

The ideal movement for a cutter would have: VB > HB, more specifically:

Around (+) 10 VB
Around (+/-) 3-5 HB (Depending on R/L Pitcher)


Ideal Cutter Location on a Movement Chart

A movement chart is a tool that players and coaches can use to analyze the ideal movement and placement of a given pitch.



What each zone represents:

The grey circle in the center of the chart represents the “gyro zone” which is no movement in either the vertical or horizontal plane.
The upper right quadrant represents positive vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The upper left-hand quadrant represents positive vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The lower right-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The lower left-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The chart pictured above is representative of right-handed pitcher’s ideal placement for each pitch. A cutter is a pitch that you want to maintain (+) vertical break, meaning it should always fall in the upper quadrants of the movement chart. In addition, the cutter will move horizontally 3-5 inches towards the pitcher’s glove side. (In this case, into the negatives) This puts the upper left-hand quadrant as the most ideal for right-handed cutter.

For lefties, the (+) vertical break would stay the same, but the horizontal movement that would be desired would have positive value. Therefore, making the upper right-hand quadrant the most ideal for a left-handed cutter.

Cutter Grips

Below are various cutter grips we have used with success.  You can try them all and see which is most comfortable.

Cutter grip #1:



Cutter grip #2:



Cutter grip #3:



For an expanded discussion on cutter grips click here.

Cues to Help You Throw a Cutter

Let’s start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!!

There are many different cues that people use when teaching pitchers how to throw each pitch. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your cutter more effectively.

Some of the cues that we like to tell our guys are:

Trust the grip, throw it like a fastball
Middle finger pressure, throw it like a fastball
Come off the side of the ball, throw it hard
Throw it like a football spiral
Another thing to focus on when throwing the cutter is where you will last touch the ball right before release.

If you cut the ball into 4 quadrants, you want to release the cutter off of the bottom right quadrant of the baseball. This will allow the pitcher to create backspin with the pitch while still adding some degree of side / gyro spin that will create the “cut” action you are looking for.



See video below for a visual example of what we are referring too…



Cutter Data: What we like… What we don’t like… (Specifically for athletes who have access to data tracking devices such as Rapsodo, Trackman, Pitch Logic, etc.)

What we like to see:

Spin efficiency of 35-40% (or slightly higher)
Velocity drop vs. 4-seam of about 3-6 mph
A greater VERTICAL break (+) than HORIZONTAL (+/-)
Glove-side lateral movement
Relatively consistent spin axis from pitch-to-pitch
Consistent spin efficiency
What we don’t like to see:

Spin efficiency lower than 35% (as it begins to approach a slider)
No glove-side break
Somewhat inconsistent spin-axis from pitch-to-pitch
Somewhat inconsistent spin-efficiency from pitch-to-pitch (the more inconsistent the spin-axis and spin-efficiency, the more inconsistent the break. This in turn implies less overall command of the pitch)
Tunneling Tips – When and Where to Throw a Cutter

The cutter is a great pitch to play off a 4SFB or SL.

Cutter / 4SFB – Both the cutter and 4SFB possess (+) VB. This allows both pitches to look similar coming out of the pitcher’s hand. Considering that the cutter will move horizontally towards the pitcher’s glove side causes the pitches to eventually separate and move differently in the later part of decent towards the plate. This can cause some serious deception between the two pitches and cause hitters to misread the two, causing timing issues and straight swing and misses.



Cutter / SL – Although not done often, the cutter can also be played off the slider. If you have the ability to spin both of these pitches, and not have them merge into one, this can be a very elite tunneling opportunity. Due to the fact that both pitches move in the horizonal plane, and move towards the pitcher’s glove side, it could allow for increased deception between the two pitches. The cutter and slider will look similar during the first half of decent towards the plate, and the slider will then continue to break more horizontally than the cutter as they get closer to the hitter. This will increase the deception between these two pitches, which will cause timing issues for the hitter as well.



Our suggestions for best times to throw a slider:

0-0 to get ahead, and disrupt the hitters timing
0-1 – after throwing a 4SFB, or slider (on 0-0)
1-1 – to set up the slider as the put away pitch with 2 strikes, trying to generate a swing or miss pitch for a strike out
Although these could be the more ideal times to throw a cutter, another good option could be using the cutter when you are behind in the count. Normally, when a hitter is ahead in a count, he expects the pitcher to deliver a FB to get back on track. This would be a good time to throw a pitch that looks like a fastball… but breaks a little differently than the hitter is expecting it. Thus, potentially resulting in weak contact or a swing and a miss.

Example of an Elite MLB Cutter

In this article we have already mentioned some of the MLB’s most elite cutters such as Corbin Burnes and Kenley Jansen. However, the cutter that we want to emphasize here is… Emmanuel Clase’s cutter.

This pitch is ELITE. Emmanuel Clase throws his cutter at 100 MPH!!! In addition to the high velocity on the pitch, it also comes in at 2600 RPM (+11VB, -3HB). In 2022, Clase threw his cutter 59.7% of the time. Clase’s cutter produced a .189 BA, .212wOBA, 22.5 whiff %, and 28.9 K%. The close out his arsenal, Clase throws a 4SFB and SL. This allows him to use his cutter of BOTH his 4SFB and SL, making his arsenal even more deceptive and effective. He is a great example when looking at the type of cutter to emulate.

How to Throw a Splitter (Grips, Cues, Types, etc.)


Welcome back to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even a top MLB comparison for reference when looking at a given pitch. Next up, how to throw a splitter.

Overview



The splitter is an off-speed pitch similar to a change-up. It is thrown with a wide grip, causing it to spin significantly less than a fastball. The low spin rate causes this pitch to have serious drop when thrown correctly. The direction and how well it tunnels off of a pitcher’s fastball will cause it to disrupt hitters timing to cause swing and misses and ground balls.

Desired Movement Profile

Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a splitter, let’s continue to discuss how we want the splitter to move. As we mentioned already, splitters are similar to changeups… but not entirely the same. Due to the type of grip used when throwing a splitter, its movement can differ from pitch to pitch.

In addition, elite splitters have extremely low spin rates. Typically a splitter is thrown under 1000 RPM, but could be thrown as low as 800, 700, or even some cases of 600 RPM or lower. This significant decrease in RPM is what causes it to have such serious drop.

Although the goal of the splitter is to induce this “dropping” effect, the amount of horizonal movement on the splitter can vary from pitch to pitch. In addition to the drop, splitters typically will possess some degree of arm side run but also have the ability to sometimes cut slightly. Both outcomes are ok, assuming that the main goal is achieved, the pitch is “dropping”. For a right-handed pitcher, the splitter can move anywhere from -3 HB to +15HB, as long as the pitch maintains a vertical break of no more than 10 inches. (Thus achieving serious vertical separation from a pitcher’s fastball.)



Ideal Splitter Location on a Movement Chart

A movement chart is a tool that players and coaches can use to analyze the ideal movement and placement of a given pitch.



What each zone represents:

The upper right quadrant represents positive vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The upper left-hand quadrant represents positive vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The lower right-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The lower left-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The chart pictured above is representative of a right-handed pitcher’s ideal placement for each pitch. A splitter is one you want to “drop” out of the pitcher’s hand. Although the splitter will typically have some degree of arm side run, it’s possible for this pitch to cut slightly at times. This means it will typically have positive horizontal break towards the pitcher’s arm side but sometimes break towards the pitcher’s glove side. This puts the upper right-hand quadrant as the most ideal for right-handed splitter that runs. In addition, that puts the upper-left handed quadrant (really close to the axis) as the most ideal for right-handed splitters that cuts.

For lefties, the vertical drop would stay the same. But the horizontal movement that would be desired would have negative value when running and positive value when cutting Therefore, making the upper left-hand quadrant as the most ideal for a left-handed splitter that runs. In addition, that puts the upper-right hand quadrant (really close to the axis) as the most ideal for left-handed splitters that cuts.

Splitter Grip

Now let’s dive into how to grip the splitter…



Generally speaking, the splitter will be thrown with a wide grip (index and middle fingers) which causes the decrease in RPM that generates the downward movement. In addition, hand size and finger flexibility can definitely play a role in the ability to throw the splitter. There are several variations that we try with our athletes:

Grip #1 – Standard Splitter

The standard splitter grip will have the index and middle fingers spread out around a typical 2-seam grip with the thumb underneath the baseball for control. The ring and pinky fingers will be off to the side, allowing the splitter to come off the inside of the split fingers.



Grip #2 – Standard Splitter (with a hiked thumb)

Here is a variation to the standard grip that alter thumb placement which can help guys get a better feel for the splitter.



Grip # 3 – The Off-Set

Here is another variation to the standard grip that offsets the grip to the right to allow for more finger pressure which can help guys get a better feel for the splitter.



Grip #4 – “The Gausman”

The last variation we use, the “Gausman”, allows for more fingers on top of the ball which could give guys more of a “controlled” feel compared to the traditional splitter grip.



Cues to Help You Throw a Splitter

Let’s start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!!

There are many different cues that people use when teaching pitchers how to throw a splitter. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your splitter more effectively. Some of the cues we use with our athletes are:

Let the ball come off the inside of your fingers
Don’t release the ball with your fingertips
Pull the split fingers down towards the plate
Throw the pointer finger first
Tunneling Tips – When and Where to Throw a Splitter

The splitter is a great pitch to play off of a 4-seam fastball. The difference in vertical drop, and separation, between the splitter and 4-seam fastball make it a very deceptive combination. The direction of this pitch and how well it tunnels off of a pitcher’s fastball will cause this pitch to disrupt hitters timing to cause swing and misses and ground balls.



Elite MLB Splitters

Standard Splitter Grip – Shohei Ohtani is a great example of someone who throws an ELITE splitter with a standard grip. Last year, Ohtani had one of the best splitters in baseball. This pitch compliments his 4-seam fastball well and it’s evident by the results. It consistently disrupted hitters timing, induced swing and misses, and produced weak contact.

In 2022, Ohtani’s splitter produced a .126 BA, .166 wOBA, 49.7 whiff %, and 30.4 K%. Here is a great example to look at when trying to emulate an ELITE splitter with a standard grip.



Below is Ohtani’s pitch movement chart with the purple dot near the middle representing his splitter movement:



Outlier Splitter Grip – Despite his unorthodox grip, Kevin Gausman throws an ELITE splitter. Gausman’s splitter is so effective at complimenting his 4-seam that he is essentially a “2-pitch pitcher”. Last year, Gausman’s splitter was the most chased pitch in all of baseball registering a 50.9% chase rate.

In 2022, his splitter produced a .195 BA, .231 wOBA, 44.1% whiff%, and 25.0 K%. Although most splitters in the MLB aren’t thrown the way Gausman throws it, he could still be an ELITE pitcher to try and emulate if you want to throw a nasty splitter with an unorthodox grip.

How to Throw a Curveball (Grips, Cues, Types)


Welcome to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different  grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even a top MLB comparisons for reference when looking at a given pitch. First up, how to throw a curveball.



Curve Ball Overview

The curveball is a staple off-speed for pitchers to add to their arsenal. Generally speaking, a curveball will have a higher spin rate, but be thrown anywhere from 10-15 MPH slower than the fastball. The increase in spin rate, in addition to the axis the pitch is thrown on, will cause the pitch to break, or “curve” much differently than any other pitch. Having a specific pitch that breaks differently and slower than the fastball can disrupt a hitters timing and throw off their approach at the plate. Ideally, the pitcher will tunnel the curveball off the fastball, making both pitches look similar out of ball release to create an aspect of deception with the pitch.

In this article, we will be taking a deep dive into how to throw a curveball with a few different grips and cues to help you throw it more effectively and efficiently.

Desired Curveball Movement Profile
Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a curveball, lets continue to discuss how we want this pitch to move.

Typically speaking, we look for a curveball to possess more vertical movement (drop) than horizontal movement (sweep). However, this won’t always be the case based on the pitchers arm slot. A pitcher with a higher arm slot will create a more “12-6” curveball that has more vertical break than horizontal break. As the arm slot of the pitcher gets lower, the more horizontal movement the pitch will have.



True Curveball – VB > HB
True Slider – VB < HB
Slurve (CB/SL combo) – VB = HB

Curveball Grips

Now let’s discuss how you grip it and throw it. This is a typical curveball grip. The middle and index finger are held together, pressed up on the seam. The thumb is placed opposite of the middle finger, and hugs the seam on the bottom of the ball. The ring and pinky fingers rest off to the side of the ball. The location of the middle and index finger pressed up on the seam, enhances the ability to “rip down” on baseball… allowing for more spin, movement, and depth on the pitch.



Typical Curveball Grip

Another widely used curveball grip is the “spiked” curveball. This grip is essentially a variation of a typical curveball grip but with the index finger “spiked”, or pressing, on the ball instead of assuming its position next to the middle finger. There are a couple of reasons why some pitchers prefer this grip, and feel, over the traditional curveball grip…



Spiked Curveball Grip

Having the index finger pressing into the baseball, the “spiked” grip forces the pitcher to maintain more of a stiff wrist and focus more on their middle finger pressure through ball release. This helps with maintaining a good hand path through the pitch which helps with overall direction and could also create more of a “ripping” or “pulling” feel for the middle finger to come off the ball.

Cues to Help you Throw a Curveball

 Lets start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!!

There are many different cues that people use when teaching pitchers how to throw each pitch. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your curveball more effectively.

Some of the cues that we like to tell our guys are:

Throw your pinky at the target
Rip down on the seam with the middle finger
Come over the ball


Curveball Data: What we like… What we don’t like… (Specifically for athletes who have access to data tracking devices such as Rapsodo, Trackman, Pitch Logic, etc.)

What we like to see:

Spin efficiency at 65%+
Relatively consistent spin axis from pitch-to-pitch
Consistent spin efficiency
Velocity drop vs. 4-seam of about 10-15 mph
Greater VERTICAL drop than HORIZONTAL
How to throw a curveball – What we don’t like to see:

Spin efficiency lower than 50% (as it begins to approach a slider)
Velocity drop in excess of 16+ mph
Somewhat inconsistent spin-axis from pitch-to-pitch
Somewhat inconsistent spin-efficiency from pitch-to-pitch
Tunneling Tips and When and Where to Throw a Curveball

 The curveball is a great pitch to play off a 4SFB. Whether it be early on in a count to disrupt a hitter’s timing or following a 4SFB to deceive the hitter and generate a swing and a miss; both are effective in competition. The curveball plays so well off the 4SFB due to both pitches operating in the vertical plane. Typically, a good 4SFB has (+) vertical break, and a good curveball will have (-) vertical break. This means a pitcher can make both pitches look very similar out of release point and during the first part of decent towards the plate.

Our suggestions for best times to throw a curveball:

0-0 – to get ahead, and disrupt the hitters timing
1-0 – when the hitter is expecting a fastball
1-2 – trying to generate a swing and miss pitch for a strikeout


Example of an Elite MLB Curveball – Max Fried

Max Fried throws an ELITE curveball. It is one of the slower curveballs in the MLB, at 75 MPH it has ridiculous drop and vertical movement. Last season, Fried’s curveball produced a .174 BA, .199 wOBA, 40.2 whiff %, and a 39.7 K%. You can see how Fried’s curveball would play well off a 4SFB thrown in the upper part of the zone. He is a great example when looking at the type of curveball to emulate.

How to Throw a Slider or Sweeper (Grips, Cues, etc.)


Welcome back to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even top MLB comparisons for reference when looking at a given pitch. Next up… How to Throw a Slider.



Overview

Similarly to the curveball, the slider is another type of off-speed that pitchers can add to their arsenal. Generally speaking, a slider will be thrown anywhere from 5-10 MPH slower than the fastball, depending on which type of slider is thrown. There are two types of sliders:

Sweeping sliders – more side spin and true spin
Gyro sliders – more gyro spin and less true spin
Later in the article, we will dive into more details regarding the similarities and differences of both types of sliders; however, one thing to note is that both pitches will move on the horizontal plane and “slide” to the pitcher’s glove side to some degree.

Ideally, the pitcher will tunnel the sweeping slider off the 2SFB or CH, making the pitches look similar out of ball release to create an aspect of deception with the pitch. On the other hand, the gyro slider typically plays better off of a 4SFB.

In this article, we will be taking a deep dive into a few different slider grips and cues to help you throw your slider more effectively and efficiently.

Desired Movement Profile

Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a better slider, let’s continue to discuss how we want this pitch to move.

Typically speaking, we look for a slider to possess more horizontal movement (sweep) than vertical movement (drop). The amount of movement of the pitch will vary based on the type of slider thrown.

Sweeping Sliders – As mentioned previously, sweeping sliders rely heavily on side spin and true spin. By coming “around” the ball, it allows for more horizontal movement, ideally 10-15+ inches, towards the pitcher’s glove side. This will help differentiate the pitch from a curveball and help play off the 2SFB and CH.



Gyro Sliders – On the other hand, gyro sliders rely heavily on gyro spin, and typically will have less true spin, than the sweeping slider. By coming “on the side” of the ball, creating the gyro spin, gravity will play a much bigger part in allowing this pitch to “sweep”. Typically a gyro slider will only have 1-5 inches of horizontal movement, towards a pitcher’s glove side, but could be thrown with a higher velocity then their sweeping counterpart. This allows it to play better off the 4SFB.



Ideal Slider Location on a Movement Chart

A movement chart is a tool that players and coaches can use to analyze the ideal movement and placement of a given pitch.



What each zone represents:

The grey circle in the center of the chart represents the “gyro zone” which is no movement in either the vertical or horizontal plane
The upper right quadrant represents positive vertical movement and positive horizontal movement
The upper left-hand quadrant represents positive vertical movement and negative horizontal movement
The lower right-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and positive horizontal movement
The lower left-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and negative horizontal movement
The chart pictured above is representative of a right-handed pitcher’s ideal placement for each pitch. A slider is a pitch you want to “slide” out of the pitcher’s hand. This means it will have negative horizontal break towards the pitcher’s glove side. This puts the upper left-hand quadrant as the most ideal for right-handed sweeping slider.

For lefties, the vertical drop would stay the same. But the horizontal movement that would be desired would have positive value. Therefore, making the upper right-hand quadrant the most ideal for a left-handed sweeping slider.

Slider Grips

There are a few different slider grips that we use with our athletes.

Something to note is that there aren’t different slider grips for the sweeper or gyro slider per say… but rather how you throw the pitch that creates the differential in spin and movement.

All these grips will be stationed at different places on the baseball. However, all the slider grips will allow for the middle finger to be pressed up onto a seam. This will allow the pitcher to be able to “rip” around, or off the side, of the baseball which will create the desired spin.  Different pitchers have different levels of success with different slider grips.  It’s about trail and error and pitcher comfort and results.

Cues to Help you Throw a Slider

Let’s start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!!

There are many different cues that people use when teaching pitchers how to throw each pitch. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your slider more effectively.

One very important thing to note when throwing the slider is maintaining consistent release point as the rest of your pitches. If a pitcher is completely changing is arm angle to be able to throw this pitch, it will lose all of its deception and value to the pitcher’s arsenal.

Some of the cues that we like to tell our guys are:

Sweeper:

“Come around the ball”
“3 o’clock to 9 o’clock”
“Show the back of your hand to the catcher”
Gyro

“Come off the side of the ball”
“Throw it like a dart/football”
“Twist the doorknob”
Slider Data: What we like… What we don’t like… (Specifically for athletes who have access to data tracking devices such as Rapsodo, Trackman, PitchLogic, etc.)

What we like to see:

Spin efficiency
Sweeper around 15% to 35%
Gyro < 10%
Relatively consistent spin axis and efficiency from pitch-to-pitch
Velocity drop off FB of about 5-10 mph (for sweeper, and slightly less for gyro)
Greater horizontal movement then vertical movement
Movement to be glove-side
What we don’t like to see:

Spin efficiency higher than 35%
Somewhat inconsistent spin-axis from pitch-to-pitch
Velocity drop of more than 10 mph
Somewhat inconsistent spin-efficiency from pitch-to-pitch (the more inconsistent the spin-axis and spin-efficiency, the more inconsistent the break. This in turn implies less overall command of the pitch
Tunneling Tips – When and Where to Throw a Slider

The sweeping slider is a great pitch to play off a 2SFB or CH. For a righty, the 2SFB and CH will have (+) HB and for a lefty they will have (-) HB. The sweeping slider will move opposite of those two pitches. (So, (-) HB for a righty and (+) HB for a lefty) The reason why these pitches play well off each other is due to the fact that they all operate in the horizontal plane. All three pitches could look very similar out of release point and during the first part of decent towards home plate and create deception for the pitcher.



The gyro slider on the other hand typically plays better of a 4SFB. Due to the fact that the gyro spin allows gravity to play a bigger role in the “sweep” of the pitch, it will break slightly more downward than the sweeper. This will tunnel better with the 4SFB due to the vertical aspect of this pitch. All three pitches could look very similar out of release point and during the first part of decent towards home plate and create deception for the pitcher.



Our suggestions for best times to throw a slider:

0-0 to get ahead, and disrupt the hitters timing
0-1 – after throwing a 2SFB/CH (sweeper), or throwing 4SFB/CT (gyro)
0-2 – trying to generate a swing or miss pitch for a strike out
Example of Elite MLB Sliders

Sweeping Slider – Walker Buhler throws an ELITE sweeping SL. In 2021, his last full season, Buhler threw his SL 14% of the time (3rd highest behind his FB and CT). Coming in at 84 MPH and spinning at 2800 RPM (0 VB, (-) 15 HB), it profiles as one of the better sweeping SL in all of baseball. In 2021, Buhler’s SL produced a .190 BA, .199 wOBA, 34.2 whiff %, and 25.9 K%. Being that Buhler relies on a SNK in addition to his 4SFB, it allows him to utilize his sweeping SL and CB to play off both of those pitches. He is a great example when looking at the type of sweeping slider to emulate.





Gyro Slider – Shane Bieber throws an ELITE gyro SL. In 2022, Bieber threw his SL 28.8% of the time (2nd highest usage behind is FB). Coming in at 86 MPH and spinning at 2700 RPM (with (+)1 VB, (-) 2 HB), it profiles as one of the better gyro SL in all of baseball. In 2022, Beiber’s SL produced a .193 BA, .237 wOBA, 39.4 whiff %, and 27.5 K%. Being that Beiber’s primary FB is a 4SFB, the gyro SL plays really well off of that pitch within his arsenal. He is a great example when looking at the type of gyro SL to emulate.

How to Throw a Changeup (Grips, Cues, Movement, Types, etc.)


Welcome back to the “How to” series on pitching, where we will be diving into various pitches and speak about different grips, cues, tips, movement profiles, and even a top MLB comparison for reference when looking at a given pitch. Next up, how to throw a changeup.

Change Up Overview

The changeup is an off-speed pitch that pitchers can use deceptively off their fastball to disrupt a hitters timing at the plate. Generally speaking, the changeup will have some degree of “drop” or “run” to a pitcher’s arm side. In addition, the changeup will typically be around 6-12 mph slower than the pitcher’s fastball. This differential in speed and the similarity in release to a fastball is what causes the timing disruption to the hitter. This could lead to the hitter being off balanced during the swing, resulting in a positive outcome for the pitcher.



Desired Movement Profile

Before we talk about the tips and tricks on how to throw a better slider, let’s continue to discuss how we want this pitch to move.

The desired movement profile for the changeup depends on which type of fastball you will be playing it off of. For someone who primarily throws 2SFB/Sinker, you will want your changeup to possess more “run”. For a pitcher who primarily throws 4SFB, you will want your changeup to possess more “drop”. The reason for this is because it will be easier to tunnel the two pitches when they have similar movement out of the pitchers release into decent towards the plate (we will discuss this more in-depth later in this article).

For a changeup that desires more “run”:

You will want to apply more sidespin to the baseball. The sidespin is what causes the pitch to move horizontally towards the pitcher’s arm side. On this changeup pitch, we ideally want to limit the amount of vertical movement and capitalize on the amount of horizontal movement we can achieve to the pitcher’s arm side. This is a similar movement pattern to what we would look for in a pitchers 2SFB/Sinker. Typically we look for anywhere from 10-15+ inches of run on this type of change up.
For a changeup that desires more “drop” (to play off a pitcher’s 4SFB):

On this pitch, we essentially would like the pitch to have similar metrics to the 4SFB but with a drop in (+) vertical break and velocity. For example, if a RHP pitcher has a 4SFB that plays at 85 MPH with +17 VB and +5 HB – with a changeup that plays at 78 MPH with +10VB and +5HB… this change in vertical break and velocity would be ideal when trying to tunnel these two pitches and create deception when trying to fool hitters.


Ideal Changeup Location on a Movement Chart

A movement chart is a tool that players and coaches can use to analyze the ideal movement and placement of a given pitch.



What each zone represents:

The grey circle in the center of the chart represents the “gyro zone” which is a pitch with no movement in either the vertical or horizontal plane.
The upper right quadrant (image above) represents positive vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The upper left-hand quadrant represents positive vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The lower right-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and positive horizontal movement.
The lower left-hand quadrant represents negative vertical movement and negative horizontal movement.
The chart pictured above is representative of a right-handed pitcher’s ideal placement for each pitch. A changeup is a pitch you want to “drop”, or “ride” out of the pitcher’s hand. This means it will have positive horizontal break towards the pitcher’s arm side. This puts the upper right-hand quadrant as the most ideal for right-handed changeups.

For lefties, the vertical drop would stay the same. But the horizontal movement that would be desired would have negative value. Therefore, making the upper left-hand quadrant the most ideal for a left-handed changeups.

Changeup Grips

How to throw a changeup often comes down to the grip.  When gripping the changeup, there are typically 3 different variations that we try with our athletes…

Grip #1 – Traditional Changeup Grip

We usually have athletes orient this grip similar to a 2SFB, with their middle and ring ringers pressed up on the seams. The index finger and pinky will be off to the side, not touching any seams. And lastly, the thumb will be underneath the baseball for more control.



Traditional Changeup Grip

Grip #2 – Circle Changeup Grip

For the circle changeup grip, the biggest stand out is obviously… “the circle” on the side of the ball. The athlete will make a circle with their index finger and thumb on the side of the baseball, while having their other 3 fingers loosely holding onto the top of the baseball. This pitch may not be the best recommendation for younger athletes, as their hands might not be big enough to hold this grip and control it as they need too.



Circle Changeup Grip

Grip #3 – Split Changeup Grip

For the split changeup grip, the athlete will spread their index and middle fingers slightly outside the 2SFB grip. The ring, and pinky, fingers will be off to the side with the thumb on the bottom. This grip is recommended for athletes who can’t grasp the feel or release of a standard or circle changeup grip. It gives the athlete a more “fastball feel”, but the slightly split fingers allow for a similar drop in velocity.



Split Changeup Grip

Cues to Help You Throw a Changeup

If you’re wondering how to throw a changeup, let’s start with this… throwing cues are NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!!

There are many different cues that people use when teaching pitchers how to throw each pitch. You need to find which cue best suits YOU and helps YOU throw your changeup more effectively. Some of the cues we use with our athletes are:

“Throw the pointer finger first”
“Middle finger and thumb pressure – throw it like a fastball”
“Let the fingers come off the ball horizontally”


Tunneling Tips – When and Where to Throw a Changeup

The changeup that desires more “run”… is a great pitch to play off a 2SFB/Sinker. Both pitches try to limit the amount of vertical break the pitch has and maximize on the amount of horizontal break the pitch has to the pitcher’s arm side. Because both of these pitches move so similarly out of the pitcher’s hand, it will be very difficult for the hitter to pick up which one is being thrown. This will allow the differential in speed to fool the hitter and disrupt his timing.



The changeup that desires more “drop”… is a great pitch to play off a 4SFB. Both of these pitches will have similar movement and metrics. The only difference will be that the changeup should have less (+) vertical break and have a slower velocity. Because both of these pitches move so similarly out of the pitcher’s hand, it will be very difficult for the hitter to pick up which one is being thrown. This will allow the differential in speed and change in vertical break to fool the hitter and disrupt his timing.



Example of an Elite MLB Changeup

Devin Williams throws an ELITE changeup. This pitch nicknamed “the Airbender”, moves SIGNIFICANTLY different than any other change up in baseball. The average changeup in the MLB is thrown with 1750 RPM. Williams’ changeup is thrown at 2800 RPM, making it the highest spinning changeup in baseball.

In 2022, Williams threw his changeup 58% of the time (highest usage within his arsenal).  The “Airbender” produced a .185 BA, .240 wOBA, 43.9% whiff %, and 24.8 K%. Although his changeup is an outlier pitch, he is still a great example to look at when trying to emulate ELITE changeup movement and execution.

I.  Run Change-Up – Arm-side fade that pairs with a Two-Seam or Sinker.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Two-seam orientation.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Middle and ring fingers on the narrow seams; index and pinky rest off to the side.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Under center for balance.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Ball deep in hand; pressure on middle-ring to kill speed.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Match fastball tempo.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Gentle pronation; let fingers roll off sideways.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – “Throw the pointer finger first” to add run.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 6-12 mph slower than heater; 10-15″ arm-side run with light drop—great after a sinker.  

II. Drop Change-Up – Extra vertical drop to play off a Four-Seamer with carry.

    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Same middle-ring on seam, but grip slightly higher on the ball.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Flat pad under seam for back-spin feel.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Deep grip; even pressure.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Identical to fastball release.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Stay behind; minimal pronation.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – “Pull middle finger straight down.”  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 8-12 mph slower; vertical break falls 7-10″ below heater with only small arm-side drift.  

III. Circle Change-Up – Drop plus 1-to-7 tail; best for running away from opposite-hand hitters.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Four- or Two-seam.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Middle and ring on seams; index + thumb form a circle on the side.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Bottom of the circle.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Light squeeze by circle fingers; keep ball deep.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Fastball arm speed.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Pronate so circle turns toward ground.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – Feel middle/ring rip off last.  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 70-80 mph; pronounced arm-side tail and soft drop.  

IV. Split Change-Up – Fastball feel with split fingers for velocity loss. A good fallback if other grips feel wild.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Two-seam; index and middle spread a finger-width apart.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Pads rest just inside the seams.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Directly under for control.  
    4.  GRIP SQUEEZE – Moderate; let ball sit slightly deeper.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Throw like a heater.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Natural pronation; no extra twist.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – “Let fingers slip; don’t push.”  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 75-85 mph; firm drop with mild run—bridges gap between standard change and splitter.  

V.  Palmball – Extra-slow change; huge timing disruptor.  
    (steps unchanged)  

VI. Knuckleball – Fluttering chaos; near-zero spin.  
    (steps unchanged)

Baseball Pitch Grips – A Comprehensive Guide


Baseball pitch grips are a big part of throwing a baseball. Every pitcher has a unique way of holding and gripping every pitch in his arsenal. Since the size of the baseball is “a given”, success with different pitches and baseball pitch grips can be attributable to many things, including hand size, finger size, finger pressure, finger placement, depth of the hold, hand / finger dexterity and most importantly comfort. In this article we are going to review the eight major pitch types, each with its own distinct baseball pitch grip and movement pattern:

4-seam Fastball Grip
Sinker Grip / 2-seam Fastball Grip
Cutter Grip
Changeup Grip
Curveball Grip
Slider Grip
Sweeper Grip
Splitter Grip
How to throw different baseball pitches? Every pitch is defined to a significant extent by its predominant spin direction and it’s a combination of the grip and the final point of release that determines the spin direction that’s generated.  In the following guide, we will review pitch grips and the corresponding release points that generate each pitch movement.

For the purposes of this article, we are going to assume a pitcher with a 3/4 arm slot. In addition, for reference, below is an image of a hand with the name of each finger.

1. 4-Seam Fastball Grip

The fastball is the first pitch every young pitcher learns how to throw. It is the bread and butter of pitching. The more effective your fastball, the more effective the rest of your arsenal. To be an accomplished pitcher you need to command this pitch and be able to throw it hard. Below is the image for a typical 4-seam fastball grip. The index and middle fingers are generally ½ -1 inch apart from each other, with the tip of the fingers sitting perpendicular on top of the seams. The thumb should be placed underneath the ball. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a 4-seam fastball click here.



4-seam Fastball Grip

The 4-seam fastball movement is reliant on its back spin. The more back spin a 4-seam fastball has the more successful it can be. In order to generate this back spin, the fingers need to be pulling down through the baseball all the way until release. This is accomplished by releasing the ball off the index and middle fingers concurrently to generate pure back spin. Here is how it should look at the moment of release to get pure spin.



As a side note, if a fastball has too much tail or cut versus pure back spin, it’s considered to have an unintentional cut.  You can click here for additional info on this topic.

2. 2-Seam Fastball Grip / Sinker Grip

There is always some discussion whether the 2-seam fastball and the sinker are actually the same pitch. For the purposes of this article, they are. The index and middle fingers are placed together along the seams on the narrow side of the baseball. The thumb should be placed under the ball. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a 2-seam or sinker click here.



2-seam Fastball Grip / Sinker Grip

The “sinking” movement of is highly dependent on the final moment of release. Below is a video of how it should appear at the moment of release to get the appropriate type of spin. If we want this pitch to sink, meaning we want it to have more horizontal movement than vertical movement, then we need to focus on having the ball leave our fingertips at the correct angle. In the video below, you can see how the fingers are pulling through and down to the side of the ball, vs. the 4-seam fastball release above which is strictly down through the ball.

3. Cutter Grip

The cutter grip can be similar to a 4-seam grip or 2-seam grip but with the middle and index fingers closer together. Thumb placement is underneath the ball. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a cutter click here.



Cutter Grip

A cutter’s movement pattern is created at the point of release. If you cut the back of the ball into four quadrants, you want to release the Cutter off of the bottom right quadrant of the baseball. This will allow the pitcher to create backspin with the pitch while still adding some degree of side / gyro spin that will create the “cut” action you are looking for. A Cutter should have more vertical movement than horizontal (the more vertical the better). However, the pitch still needs to be moving in the horizontal plane towards the pitcher’s glove side.



4. Changeup Grip

The Changeup is one of the more popular baseball pitch grips and has several variations, but the two most common types are: the standard Changeup and the Circle Changeup. The grip for a standard Changeup involves putting the ball comfortably in your hand. Some people prefer to have it in the palm of the hand, and some would prefer to keep it loose in the fingertips. Additionally, you would wrap your five fingers all around the ball with your middle and ring fingers on top of the ball, your index finger and little finger on the sides of the ball, and your thumb on the bottom of the ball. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a changeup click here.



Changeup Grip

For the Circle Changeup grip, your thumb and index fingers form a circle on the side of the ball, while the other three fingers are placed around the baseball.



Circle Changeup Grip

A Changeup is meant to be thrown with identical intent and arm speed of a fastball. The grip will result in the pitch coming in at a slower velocity creating a deceptive pitch. With the Changeup having less velocity than the fastball it is intended to “drop” as it crosses home plate. In addition, a Changeup with “run” can be even more effective since it will not only have lower velocity but also have a more horizontal movement pattern. So, it not only drops but also has “run” compared to a 4-seam fastball.

5. Curveball Grip

A Curveball is another of the more popular baseball pitch grips and is meant to have top spin which helps create depth. The middle and index finger are held together, pressed up on the seam. The thumb is placed opposite of the middle finger and hugs the seam on the bottom of the ball. The ring and little fingers sit to the side of the ball. The location of the middle and index finger pressed up on the seam enhances the ability to “rip down” on baseball, allowing for more top spin, movement, and depth. The top spin is created at release as your fingers roll the ball forward. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a curveball click here.



Typical Curveball Grip

With a Spiked Curveball, your index finger is pressing into the baseball. The “spiked” grip forces the pitcher to maintain more of a stiff wrist and focus more on their middle finger pressure through ball release. This helps with maintaining a good hand path through the pitch which helps with overall direction and could also create more of a “ripping” or “pulling” feel for the middle finger to come off the ball.



Spiked Curveball Grip

The telltale sign of a good Curveball is one with a lot of top spin and vertical break. Depending on your arm slot, you can have varying degrees of horizontal versus vertical movement. A pure 12-6 Curveball could have 20-25 inches of vertical movement and only a few inches of horizontal movement. However, a pitcher with a lower arm slot may have more equal amounts of vertical and horizontal movement.



6. Slider Grip

The traditional slider grip places the fingers slightly off-center between the inner seams near the bottom of the horseshoe figure on the ball. The middle finger is placed directly on or near the seam, while the index finger is on the leather. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a slider click here.



Slider Grip

A traditional Slider is released very much like football, and you should be able to see a “football spiral” or “bullet-like” spin on this pitch. This bullet-like spin creates equal air pressure around the baseball, creating a pitch with less overall movement than others.



7. Sweeper Grip

The grip for the sweeper (also known as a frisbee Slider) can be identical to the traditional Slider. However, the release will be different creating a sideways spin similar to a frisbee. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a sweeper click here.



Sweeper Grip

The release on this pitch is more on the side of the ball than a traditional Slider so that you can create a side spin that helps the pitch move towards glove side. This pitch is intended to have less vertical movement and more lateral movement. The key with this pitch is to make sure you are not dropping your arm slot to create the intended lateral movement, which requires you to release the ball on the side to create that sideways spin.



8. Splitter Grip

The Splitter grip is exactly what it says. You split your middle and index finger on opposite sides of the baseball forming a V. It is a grip which requires long enough fingers that can grip the ball (which is difficult for young pitchers) and hold on to it until release. For an expanded discussion on how to throw a splitter click here.



Splitter Grip

The Splitter is thrown similarly to a fastball; however, the grip creates a reduced spin rate which causes the ball to drop sharply as it nears home plate. In the example below, this splitter has a spin rate of 286 whereas a typical fastball has spin rates approaching 2,000 or more.



Summary

The most important thing with trying out new baseball pitch grips is comfort, success, and patience. It is about trial and error, in order to perfect the grip and movement. When attempting new pitches, keep in mind that it might take a while before your new grip pays off in bullpens and game situations. A good example would be when Trevor Bauer first started working on, and throwing, his Sweeper. It took him 2 years to be able to perfect it and use it in games regularly. He actually stopped throwing it in the first year and it was not until the second season that it became one of his primary pitches.

When it comes to baseball pitch grips, it is about trial, error, practice, and patience… and then more patience and practice!

CATEGORY: FASTBALLS  (plus fastball-derived off-speed)
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

I.  Four-Seamer – A straight, top-speed strike pitch. Use it when you need a quick strike or want to blow the ball past the hitter.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Horseshoe lies sideways; index-and-middle tips sit ​perpendicular ​on the top seams.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Fingers ½-1 in apart (comfort range); ring and pinky rest lightly on the side.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Centered under the ball; keep thumb pad under the gap between index/middle to balance.  
    4.  GRIP LOGIC – Light squeeze so ball rides the fingertips; pulling straight “down through” the seams at release gives **pure back-spin** (≥90 % spin-efficiency) → true carry.  
    5.  ARM PATH – Full-speed fastball motion.  
    6.  WRIST MOVE – Stay stiff behind the ball.  
    7.  LET-GO CUE – Fingers finish together; imagine “ripping the seams straight down.”  
    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 85-100 mph; fastest, straightest pitch with subtle “rise” illusion.  

II. Ride Four-Seamer – Same speed, tuned for extra vertical “carry.” Pitch it high for whiffs, fly-outs, pop-ups.  
    • Same basic grip, but: keep fingertips pressed firmly on seam ridges, experiment with horseshoe in/out and flat vs. tucked thumb to find max vertical break (≥15 in; elite ≥18).  

III. Standard Two-Seamer – Arm-side run. Jam same-hand hitters or tail away from the opposite side.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Horseshoe upright; two narrow seams on top.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Index + middle ​touching​, running **inside the narrow seam channels** (narrow side of ball).  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Directly under ball; ring/pinky off to side.  
    4.  GRIP LOGIC – Slight pointer pressure; at release fingers “pull down and to the side” of ball → adds side-spin for 15 in+ run.  
    5-7.  Fastball effort; gentle pronation; “swipe the outside seam.”  
    8.  PATH & USE – 80-90 mph; heavy run, shares tunnel with Change-Up.  

IV. Standard Sinker – Same grip zone but goal is **less vertical break** (<10 VB) for drop.  
    • Keep fingers inside seams; add extra pointer pressure and finish with palm facing ground to lower spin axis → late dive/grounders.  

V. On-Seam & Offset Two-Seam / Sink variations – See previous draft for exact finger placements; logic: riding seam = firmer command; offset ball = bigger run or dive depending which side is favored.  

VI. Cutter Family – Fingers tighter together vs. Four-Seam; thumb under ball.  
    • **Release logic for all cutters:** Visualise ball’s back split into four quadrants; let ball roll off the **bottom-right quadrant** (RHP) to create mixed back-spin + slight gyro → glove-side cut (vertical > horizontal).  
      – Flat-Thumb = more back-spin (strike stealer).  
      – Tucked-Thumb = more gyro (sharper cut).  
      – Offset = even more gyro (bat-breaker).  

–––––––––––––––––––– SPLITTER / FORKBALL (fastball-derived drop) ––––––––––––

VII.  Standard Splitter – Wide-finger dropper.  
    1.  FINGER SPOTS – Index and middle spread into a big “V” hugging each seam; long fingers help.  
    2.  THUMB – Center under ball or slightly “hiked” for feel.  
    3.  GRIP LOGIC – Wide split + loose fingertips drops spin <1 000 rpm → sharp tumble.  
    4-7.  Throw with fastball arm speed; no forced snap; let ball slip off inner edges (“don’t use fingertips”).  
    8.  PATH – 80-90 mph; hard vertical drop, may run or cut  – goal is <10 VB.  

VIII. Offset Splitter – Rotate ball slightly to pointer side; heavier pointer pressure → quickest dive.  

IX. “Gausman” Splitter – Three fingers atop ball for big-hand control; same drop, higher strike%.  

X. Forkball – Fingers even wider/deeper; thumb may come off ball; firm pinch, wrist chop → slow, pronounced dive (75-85 mph).

CATEGORY: BREAKING BALLS
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

I.  Gyro Slider – Bullet-spin dart (1-5 HB).  
    1.  GRIP – Fingers slightly off-center near bottom of horseshoe; **middle finger sits on seam ridge, index on leather.**  
    2.  GRIP LOGIC – Football-spiral release gives gyro spin (<10 % true) → late small sweep.  

II. Sweeping Slider – Frisbee sweep (10-15 HB).  
    • Use **same seam placement** but shift ball deeper toward outer half; release “around the ball,” showing back of hand.  
    • Key: maintain original arm slot; side-spin created entirely by release touch.  

III. Standard Curveball – Vertical-dominant breaker.  
    1.  FINGER SPOTS – Index + middle together **pressed up on seam ridge**; ring/pinky off to side.  
    2.  THUMB – Opposite middle finger, hugging lower seam.  
    3.  GRIP LOGIC – Seam pinch lets middle finger “rip down” for top-spin (spin-eff ≥65 %).  
    4-7.  Over-the-top wrist snap; cue “throw pinky to target.”  

IV. Spiked Curveball – Same seam pinch but INDEX knuckle/tip digs into leather.  
    • Logic: stiffens wrist and locks hand path, amplifying middle-finger whip for sharper drop.  

V. Slurve – Standard curve grip; diagonal hand path; VB ≈ HB (11-5 shape).  

VI. Screwball – Reverse break; index + middle together on outer seam; heavy pronation.  

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
CATEGORY: OFF-SPEED PITCHES
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

I.  Run Change-Up – Standard grip (five fingers).  
    1.  FINGER SPOTS – Middle + ring on top seams; index + pinky on sides; thumb under.  
    2.  GRIP LOGIC – Deep in hand; middle-ring/thumb pressure slows ball 6-12 mph; pronation adds 10-15″ arm-side run.  

II. Circle Change-Up – Thumb + index form “OK” circle.  
    • Circle forces pronation; tail + drop (1-7 shape).  Hands must be big enough to stay comfortable.  

III. Split Change-Up – Index/middle slightly split for velocity drop while keeping fastball feel.  
    • Good for athletes who cannot command circle grip; produces blend of run & drop (~8-12 VB, 10 HB).  

IV. Palmball – Ball buried deep; loose fingertips; minimal wrist.  Slowest change; huge timing gap.  

V. Knuckleball – 2-4 knuckles/tips into leather; thumb supports; push-release with stiff wrist → near-zero spin, chaotic flutter.  

NOTE ON GRIP PRACTICE  
• Comfort and repeatability trump everything.  Hand size, finger length, pressure spots, and wrist mobility all change how each grip works.  Expect trial-and-error, plus patience (ex: Trevor Bauer’s sweeper took two years to master).  Keep what produces the desired spin and movement **without** tipping your arm slot or slowing your arm.

    8.  BALL PATH & USE – 85-100 mph; fastest, straightest pitch with subtle “rise.”  

II. Ride Four-Seamer – Same speed, tuned for extra vertical “carry.” Throw it up in the zone for whiffs, fly-outs, pop-ups.  
    • Fingertips stay locked on seam ridges; test horseshoe in/out and flat vs. tucked thumb to maximize ≥15″ VB (elite ≥18″).  

III. Standard Two-Seamer – Arm-side run. Jam same-hand hitters or tail away from opposite-hand hitters.  
    1.  SEE THE SEAMS – Horseshoe upright, narrow seams on top.  
    2.  FINGER SPOTS – Index+middle touching inside seam channels.  
    3.  THUMB SPOT – Direct center under ball.  
    4.  GRIP LOGIC – Slight pointer pressure; fingers exit “down-and-side” of ball → 15″+ run.

    8.  PATH & USE – 80-90 mph; heavy run; pairs with Run Change-Up.  

IV. On-Seam Two-Seamer – Same as III but fingertips ride seam ridges for firmer feel and a tick more velocity; cue “feel the seams.”  

V. Offset Two-Seamer – Ball shifted toward thumb; heavy middle-finger pressure; massive run with less ride. Start off plate, run back.  

VI. Standard Sinker – Uses same grip zone as Two-Seam but extra pointer squeeze + palm-down finish to lower VB (<10″). Ground-ball machine.  

VII. Offset Sinker – Ball offset toward pointer; “thumb-to-thigh” finish = sharpest nose-dive (5-9″ VB + run).  

VIII. Cutter Family – Fingers tighter than Four-Seam; thumb under.  
    • Release off **bottom-right quadrant** (RHP) to blend back-spin + slight gyro: vertical > horizontal, glove-side cut.  
      A. Standard Cutter – Everyday version (85-95 mph, 3-4″ cut).  
      B. Flat-Thumb Cutter – Thumb flat, more carry/command (2-3″ cut).  
      C. Tucked-Thumb Cutter – Thumb deep, sharper late bite (4-5″ cut).  
      D. Offset Cutter – Ball shifted toward pinky, max bat-breaking cut (5-7″).  

–––– SPLITTER / FORKBALL (fastball-derived drop) ––––

IX.  Standard Splitter – Index+middle spread wide on seams, thumb centered. Loose fingertips → spin <1 000 rpm. 80-90 mph, hard drop.  
X.  Hiked-Thumb Splitter – Thumb raised on seam for better feel; same drop, slightly softer.  
XI. Offset Splitter – Rotate ball toward pointer; heavier pointer pressure; quickest dive (chase pitch).  
XII. “Gausman” Splitter – Three fingers across top (index-middle split, ring assists control); ideal for big hands; heavy drop with strikes.  
XIII. Forkball – Fingers even wider/deeper; wrist chop; 75-85 mph, slow hump then dive.

I.  Gyro Slider – Bullet-spin dart (1-5″ HB).  
    • Grip off-center; middle on seam.  Release like football spiral (“twist doorknob”).  82-90 mph; late small sweep.  

II. Sweeping Slider – Frisbee sweep (10-15″ HB).  
    • Same seam placement but ball set deeper outer half; “show back of hand,” 3-to-9 path; stay at original arm slot. 78-88 mph.  

III. Standard Curveball – Classic 12-6 drop.  
    1.  FINGER SPOTS – Index+middle together on seam ridge; thumb under opposite seam.  
    2.  GRIP LOGIC – Seam pinch lets middle finger rip for top-spin (spin-eff ≥65 %).  
    3-7.  Over-the-top snap; cues “throw pinky,” “rip seam.”  
    8.  PATH – 70-80 mph; VB > HB.

I.  Run Change-Up – Five-finger grip, two-seam orientation.  
    • Middle+ring on seams top; index/pinky on sides; thumb under.  Ball deep, pressure middle-ring + thumb.  Fastball arm speed; gentle pronation.  10-15″ run, light drop; 6-12 mph slower.  

II. Drop Change-Up – Four-seam orientation, thumb flat for back-spin feel.  Same deep grip; stay behind ball; subtract ~7-10″ VB from heater while keeping HB ≈ heater.  

III. Circle Change-Up – Thumb+index form “OK” on side; other three on top.  Circle forces pronation → 1-to-7 tail plus drop; best vs. opposite-hand hitters.  

IV. Split Change-Up – Index/middle slightly split outside two-seam grip; fastball feel; velocity loss; produces mix of run & drop.  

V.  Palmball – Ball buried deep in palm; loose fingertips; minimal wrist; slowest (65-75 mph) with gentle sink.  

VI. Knuckleball – 2-4 knuckles or tips into leather; thumb supports.  Stiff wrist push-release → near-zero spin; 60-70 mph chaotic flutter.

    1.  Grip the baseball so the horseshoe-shaped seam lies perfectly sideways under the index and middle fingers.  
    2.  Place the pads of the index and middle fingers one-half to one inch apart, perpendicular across the two top seams.  
    3.  Rest the ring finger and little finger lightly against the outside of the baseball for stability.  
    4.  Position the pad of the thumb directly beneath the gap between the index and middle fingers so that the ball is perfectly balanced.  
    5.  Hold the ball only with the fingertips; keep the palm clear of the leather to prevent friction that would reduce velocity.  
    6.  Apply only a light squeeze so that the fingers can snap downward freely through the release.  
    7.  Deliver with full, aggressive fastball arm speed from the normal arm slot.  
    8.  Keep the wrist firm and directly behind the baseball; do not tilt or roll the wrist.  
    9.  At the instant of release, pull both index and middle fingers straight downward through the seams, releasing them at the exact same moment to create pure backspin and a spin-efficiency of ninety percent or higher.  
    10. The baseball travels between eighty-five and one hundred miles per hour, appears to “rise” because of backspin, and is used for quick strikes or to blow the ball past a hitter.

II.  RIDE FOUR-SEAMER – Vertical-carry variation of the basic four-seamer.  
    Purpose: Generate maximum induced vertical break (“carry”) to miss bats at the top of the strike zone.  
    1.  Set the horseshoe exactly as in the standard four-seam fastball.  
    2.  Press the fingertips of the index and middle fingers firmly on the raised seam ridges rather than on the leather surface.  
    3.  Position the thumb either flat or slightly tucked, experimenting until the release produces the highest possible vertical break.  
    4.  Maintain the same finger spacing, light fingertip grip, and palm-off-ball feel as the standard four-seamer.  
    5.  Drive down the mound with full fastball intent, remaining tall so the hand stays directly behind the baseball.  
    6.  Keep the wrist perfectly firm and directly behind the ball; avoid any sideways tilt that would create cut.  
    7.  Rip the seams straight down at release with both fingers leaving together.  
    8.  Aim to create at least fifteen inches of induced vertical break; elite pitchers reach eighteen inches or more.  
    9.  Use this pitch up in the zone when a swing-and-miss or a weak fly ball is required.

III.  STANDARD TWO-SEAMER – Arm-side running fastball.  
    Purpose: Induce weak contact, tie up a same-side hitter’s hands, or run the ball back onto the outside corner against an opposite-side hitter.  
    1.  Turn the baseball so the narrow seams (the seams that form the “railroad tracks”) sit on top.  
    2.  Place the pads of the index and middle fingers together between those two seams, riding inside the “tracks.”  
    3.  Rest the thumb directly beneath the center of the baseball to keep balance.  
    4.  Keep the grip off the palm and on the fingertips, but add slightly more pressure with the index finger than with the middle finger.  
    5.  Use full fastball arm speed from the normal arm slot.  
    6.  As the hand moves forward, pronate the forearm ever so slightly so that the fingers work down and to the arm-side of the ball.  
    7.  Allow the index finger to be the last point of contact, finishing “across” the outside seam.  
    8.  Expect velocities of eighty to ninety miles per hour with approximately fifteen inches or more of arm-side horizontal break and roughly ten inches of vertical break.  

IV.  ON-SEAM TWO-SEAMER – Firm-feel two-seamer.  
    Purpose: Provide the same running movement as the standard two-seamer but with slightly firmer velocity and crisper command by placing the fingertips directly on the seam ridges.  
    1.  Align the baseball exactly as in the standard two-seamer.  
    2.  Seat the pads of the index and middle fingers directly on top of the seam ridges, not between them.  
    3.  Keep the thumb under the center of the ball and the ring and little fingers off the side.  
    4.  Maintain slightly firmer finger pressure because the seams give tactile feedback.  
    5.  Deliver with full fastball arm speed.  
    6.  Pronate slightly through release as with the standard two-seamer.  
    7.  Finish by “swiping the seam,” feeling the fingers brush along the raised threads.  
    8.  The pitch retains arm-side run but often at one to two miles per hour higher velocity and with sharper command.

V.  OFFSET TWO-SEAMER – Maximum-run two-seamer.  
    Purpose: Create exaggerated arm-side run for back-door strikes or to force a hitter to chase off the plate.  
    1.  Rotate the baseball so the horseshoe is upright.  
    2.  Shift the ball slightly toward the thumb side so that more leather lies under the middle finger.  
    3.  Pin the thumb slightly off center toward the thumb side to counterbalance the shift.  
    4.  Apply strong middle-finger pressure while keeping the grip on the fingertips.  
    5.  Throw with standard fastball arm speed, targeting a knee-high lane that begins off the plate.  
    6.  Pronate aggressively so that the ball rolls off the index side of the hand.  
    7.  Finish with the fingers feeling a pronounced “swipe” across the outside of the ball.  
    8.  Expect enormous horizontal movement with somewhat reduced ride; ideal for starting outside and running back into the zone.

VI.  STANDARD SINKER – Late-dropping fastball variant.  
    Purpose: Induce ground-ball contact, especially double-play grounders with runners on base.  
    1.  Grip the baseball exactly as the standard two-seamer with the fingers inside the narrow seams.  
    2.  Increase pointer-finger pressure to tilt the spin axis downward.  
    3.  Keep the thumb directly under the baseball.  
    4.  Use the usual fastball arm speed and normal three-quarter arm slot.  
    5.  Pronate quietly but finish with the hand slightly palm-down to encourage top-spin.  
    6.  Let both fingers leave the ball together so the spin axis stays low.  
    7.  Aim for less than ten inches of vertical break and at least fifteen inches of horizontal run.  
    8.  The baseball will dive under barrels and produce ground-ball outs.

VII. OFFSET SINKER – Extreme-drop sinker.  
    Purpose: Obtain the greatest possible downward movement when a true “bowling-ball” pitch is needed.  
    1.  Set the baseball as for the standard sinker but slide it toward the index-finger side of the hand.  
    2.  Allow the thumb to move slightly toward the index side to counterbalance the shift.  
    3.  Squeeze firmly with the index finger, reducing pressure on the middle finger.  
    4.  Drive down the mound aiming at the catcher’s shins.  
    5.  Pronate more forcefully, turning the palm inward and downward.  
    6.  Finish the motion with the cue “thumb to thigh,” which forces the wrist to snap downward.  
    7.  The pitch travels seventy-eight to eighty-eight miles per hour, drops sharply in the final fifteen feet, and is very difficult to lift.

VIII. STANDARD CUTTER – Medium-depth glove-side cutting fastball.  
    Purpose: Miss the barrel, prevent solid contact, and tie up opposite-hand hitters by moving late toward the hitter’s hands.  
    1.  Start with a four-seam fastball orientation.  
    2.  Slide the baseball slightly toward the glove-side so that the index and middle fingers sit close together just off center.  
    3.  Position the thumb directly beneath the ball.  
    4.  Hold on the fingertips with middle-finger pressure dominant.  
    5.  Use full fastball arm speed.  
    6.  Keep the wrist mostly firm but allow a subtle glove-side roll as the hand unwinds.  
    7.  Let the ball exit the bottom-right quadrant of the baseball (for a right-handed pitcher); this blends back-spin with a small amount of gyro spin.  
    8.  Velocities run eighty-five to ninety-five miles per hour with three to four inches of late glove-side cut and approximately ten inches of induced vertical break.

IX. FLAT-THUMB CUTTER – Carry-heavy cutter.  
    Purpose: Steal called strikes and back-door hitters by retaining vertical ride while adding slight cut.  
    1.  Use the standard cutter finger placement.  
    2.  Lay the thumb’s pad flat under the center seam rather than tucking it deep.  
    3.  Maintain a light, fastball-like grip pressure.  
    4.  Throw with identical arm speed and “trust the grip” without forcing additional wrist turn.  
    5.  The ball carries like a four-seamer for two-thirds of its flight, then moves two to three inches glove-side just before reaching the plate.

X.  TUCKED-THUMB CUTTER – Sharper, late-breaking cutter.  
    Purpose: Obtain an extra bite in two-strike counts when a swing-and-miss is required.  
    1.  Begin with the standard cutter grip.  
    2.  Tuck the tip of the thumb tightly underneath the seam so the thumb knuckle sits almost under the ball.  
    3.  Increase middle-finger pressure against the seam.  
    4.  Deliver with full arm speed and imagine throwing a tight football spiral.  
    5.  The result is four to five inches of late, sharp glove-side cut.

XI. OFFSET CUTTER – Maximum-cut bat breaker.  
    Purpose: Shatter bats or jam the hitter by creating the greatest glove-side movement of any cutter variation.  
    1.  Rotate the baseball farther toward the pinky-finger side so the middle finger rides the outside seam ridge.  
    2.  Slide the thumb toward the pinky side to keep balance.  
    3.  Apply very heavy pressure with the middle finger.  
    4.  Throw the pitch hard down and in on the opposite-hand hitter.  
    5.  Pronounce the glove-side wrist roll so the ball leaves the bottom-right quadrant aggressively.  
    6.  The ball travels eighty to ninety-two miles per hour with five to seven inches of cut and approximately eight to ten inches of vertical carry.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

XII. STANDARD SPLITTER – Classic tumbling split-fingered fastball.  
     Purpose: Provide a fastball look-alike that vanishes beneath the bat for strikeouts or weak grounders.  
     1.  Orient the ball with the narrow seams on top, similar to a two-seam fastball.  
     2.  Spread the index and middle fingers into a wide “V,” each finger sitting on its own seam.  
     3.  Place the thumb pad under the midpoint for stability.  
     4.  Keep the grip on the fingertips but allow the ball to sit slightly deeper than a four-seam.  
     5.  Maintain relaxed finger pressure so spin rate stays below one thousand revolutions per minute.  
     6.  Deliver with full fastball arm speed; do not manipulate the wrist.  
     7.  Let the ball slip from the inside edges of the split fingers; do not push off the fingertips.  
     8.  The baseball reaches eighty-to-ninety miles per hour and drops violently in the final third of its flight; horizontal movement may run arm-side or cut slightly.

XIII. HIKED-THUMB SPLITTER – Thumb-raised feel splitter.  
     Purpose: Provide pitchers whose standard splitter slips out early with a higher-leverage feel and slightly softer velocity.  
     1.  Set up the standard splitter grip.  
     2.  Slide the thumb tip up onto the lower seam rather than under the ball.  
     3.  Keep all other elements identical.  
     4.  During release permit the thumb to come off last, adding a hint of extra tumble.  
     5.  Expect velocities of seventy-eight to eighty-eight miles per hour with a smooth, steep drop.

XIV. OFFSET SPLITTER – Pointer-pressure, quick-dive splitter.  
     Purpose: Produce the fastest possible downward break for a chase pitch under the strike zone.  
     1.  Rotate the ball a few degrees toward the index-finger side.  
     2.  Weight the grip pressure heavily onto the index-finger seam.  
     3.  Keep the thumb slightly off center toward the index side.  
     4.  Throw with the cue “throw the pointer finger first,” adding a touch of pull-down.  
     5.  The pitch dives abruptly beneath the strike zone and is ideal with two strikes.

XV. “GAUSMAN” SPLITTER – Three-finger control splitter modeled after Kevin Gausman.  
     Purpose: Maintain the devastating drop of a splitter while achieving better command.  
     1.  Hold the ball with the index and middle fingers spread as in a splitter, but rest the ring finger on top of the ball between them.  
     2.  Keep the thumb under the seam opposite the ring finger for balance.  
     3.  Apply even, relaxed pressure across all three top fingers.  
     4.  Use fastball arm speed with no additional wrist action.  
     5.  The pitch travels eighty-to-ninety miles per hour, drops sharply, and is easier to locate in the strike zone.

XVI. FORKBALL – Deep, slow, exaggerated-drop off-speed.  
     Purpose: Fool the hitter’s timing and induce weak grounders or swings and misses, especially for pitchers without top velocity.  
     1.  Place the baseball between the index and middle fingers so wide that the fingers nearly touch the leather on opposite sides.  
     2.  Push the ball deep toward the palm.  
     3.  Optional: Lift the thumb entirely off the ball or keep it barely touching for balance.  
     4.  Use a slightly reduced arm speed but maintain identical arm slot.  
     5.  Snap the wrist downward at release.  
     6.  The ball leaves at seventy-five to eighty-five miles per hour, floats, then falls precipitously.

XVII. GYRO SLIDER – Bullet-spin, short-sweeping slider.  
      Purpose: Provide a fast, late dart that tunnels with a four-seam fastball and induces empty swings.  
      1.  Rotate the baseball so the bottom of the horseshoe faces the pitcher.  
      2.  Place the middle finger directly on the seam ridge; place the index finger snug beside it on the leather.  
      3.  Put the thumb under the inside seam opposite the middle finger.  
      4.  Apply medium pressure focused on the middle finger.  
      5.  Maintain true fastball arm speed and original arm slot.  
      6.  At release “throw a dart” or “throw a football,” imparting gyro spin (true-spin percentage under ten percent).  
      7.  Finish with the middle finger peeling off the side of the ball; wrist ends slightly cocked.  
      8.  The pitch reaches eighty-two to ninety miles per hour, breaks one to five inches glove side, and drops only a little.

XVIII. SWEEPING SLIDER – Frisbee-style, large-sweeping slider.  
      Purpose: Break far across the plate for front-door or back-door strikes and induce off-balance swings.  
      1.  Use the same basic seam orientation as the gyro slider.  
      2.  Shift the ball deeper toward the outer half of the hand so the middle finger rides the outer seam.  
      3.  Apply heavy pressure with the middle finger.  
      4.  Keep the thumb directly under the ball for balance.  
      5.  Drive the arm with full fastball effort, preserving the original arm slot.  
      6.  At release “show the back of the hand to the catcher,” rotating around the side of the ball from three o’clock to nine o’clock.  
      7.  Allow the ball to spin with fifteen to thirty-five percent true spin, creating ten to fifteen inches of horizontal sweep and minimal drop.  
      8.  Velocities range from seventy-eight to eighty-eight miles per hour.

XIX. STANDARD CURVEBALL – Traditional twelve-to-six overhand breaking ball.  
      Purpose: Change eye level, disrupt timing early, or serve as a strikeout pitch when buried below the zone.  
      1.  Hold the horseshoe sideways so the seam sits under both top fingers.  
      2.  Place the index and middle fingers together on the top seam ridge to maximize grip friction.  
      3.  Seat the thumb on the bottom seam directly opposite the middle finger.  
      4.  Rest the ring finger and little finger on the outside of the baseball.  
      5.  Squeeze firmly between the thumb and middle finger.  
      6.  Use the normal or slightly higher arm slot.  
      7.  At release “come over the ball,” ripping the seam with the middle finger while the wrist snaps downward.  
      8.  The ball leaves at seventy to eighty miles per hour, spinning forward with a spin-efficiency of at least sixty-five percent and more vertical drop than horizontal movement.

XX.  SPIKED CURVEBALL – Sharp, late-breaking curveball.  
      Purpose: Provide a later, snappier drop than the standard curveball, useful when a hitter is sitting on a slower break.  
      1.  Use the same seam orientation as the standard curveball.  
      2.  Bend the index finger so the knuckle or fingertip presses firmly into the leather between the seams.  
      3.  Keep the middle finger on the seam ridge.  
      4.  Pinch the ball between the bent index and the thumb underneath.  
      5.  Maintain a very stiff wrist because the bent index finger naturally reduces wrist flex.  
      6.  Snap the wrist downward quickly at release, feeling the middle finger “pull the seam.”  
      7.  Velocity and top-spin are similar to the standard curveball, but the break occurs later and with a sharper angle.

XXI. SLURVE – Diagonal blend of slider sweep and curveball drop.  
      Purpose: Offer movement that travels both down and across, confusing hitters who expect either a pure curve or pure slider.  
      1.  Grip the ball exactly like the standard curveball.  
      2.  Apply even pressure on both the index and middle fingers.  
      3.  Deliver with full fastball arm speed.  
      4.  Roll the wrist diagonally from the upper arm-side toward the lower glove-side.  
      5.  Allow the ball to leave the fingers on a path that combines top-spin and side-spin.  
      6.  The ball travels seventy to eighty miles per hour, breaking on an eleven-to-five trajectory with vertical and horizontal components that are roughly equal.

XXII. SCREWBALL – Reverse-break, arm-side breaking ball.  
      Purpose: Surprise the hitter by moving in the opposite direction of a slider or curve, typically away from same-side hitters.  
      1.  Hold the ball with the horseshoe upright and shift it toward the arm-side half of the hand.  
      2.  Keep the index and middle fingers together, index finger on the outer seam.  
      3.  Place the thumb under the outer seam.  
      4.  Grip firmly but keep the fingertips exposed.  
      5.  Throw with full fastball arm speed.  
      6.  Pronate heavily at release so the palm turns outward.  
      7.  Finish with the hand outside the lead knee.  
      8.  The pitch reaches sixty-five to seventy-five miles per hour and breaks from one o’clock to seven o’clock for a right-handed pitcher.

XXIII. RUN CHANGE-UP – Arm-side fading change-up that pairs with a two-seam fastball or sinker.  
       Purpose: Disrupt timing while mimicking the run of the arm-side fastball; excellent for inducing ground balls and soft contact.  
       1.  Hold the ball in a two-seam orientation.  
       2.  Position the middle and ring fingers on top of the narrow seams.  
       3.  Set the index and little fingers on the sides of the ball for balance.  
       4.  Place the thumb pad under the center of the ball.  
       5.  Seat the ball deeper into the hand than a fastball, allowing the palm to contact the leather.  
       6.  Apply pronounced pressure with the middle and ring fingers as well as the thumb; the deeper grip subtracts velocity.  
       7.  Use identical arm speed and arm slot to the fastball.  
       8.  Pronate gently so the fingers roll off the outside of the ball, enhancing horizontal movement.  
       9.  The pitch is six to twelve miles per hour slower than the fastball, with ten to fifteen inches of arm-side run and modest drop.

XXIV. DROP CHANGE-UP – Vertical-drop change-up that pairs with a four-seam fastball possessing ride.  
       Purpose: Fool hitters expecting a high-carry fastball by providing the same initial trajectory but reduced vertical break and velocity.  
       1.  Use a four-seam orientation, horseshoe sideways.  
       2.  Grip the ball with the middle and ring fingers across the top seams.  
       3.  Support the ball with the thumb pad flat under the bottom seam to preserve back-spin feel.  
       4.  Seat the ball deep in the hand.  
       5.  Maintain equal finger pressure; reduce velocity by grip depth rather than by slowing the arm.  
       6.  Keep the wrist directly behind the baseball without forced pronation.  
       7.  Pull straight down with the middle finger so vertical break is reduced by seven to ten inches relative to the fastball.  
       8.  The pitch is eight to twelve miles per hour slower, drops more, and moves little horizontally, matching the fastball’s initial spin axis.

XXV. CIRCLE CHANGE-UP – Tail-and-drop change-up created by an “OK” sign grip.  
       Purpose: Run away from opposite-hand hitters while also dropping under the barrel.  
       1.  Place the baseball in a four-seam or two-seam orientation, whichever feels best.  
       2.  Form a circle with the thumb and index finger on the side of the ball, creating an “OK” sign.  
       3.  Lay the middle and ring fingers across the top seams; rest the little finger on the outside of the ball.  
       4.  Keep the ball deep in the hand so the palm contacts the leather.  
       5.  Apply gentle squeeze through the circle; the circle forces automatic pronation.  
       6.  Throw with full fastball arm speed.  
       7.  Pronate naturally so the circle rotates downward toward the ground.  
       8.  Release with the middle and ring fingers last, producing a one-to-seven tail and a soft vertical drop.

XXVI. SPLIT CHANGE-UP – Velocity-reduction change-up using a mild finger split.  
       Purpose: Provide a fastball-feeling change-up for pitchers who struggle with the circle or standard grip.  
       1.  Orient the ball along the narrow seams.  
       2.  Spread the index and middle fingers slightly wider than a fastball grip but not as wide as a splitter.  
       3.  Keep the thumb directly underneath for stability and control.  
       4.  Hold the ball slightly deeper in the fingers to slow it down.  
       5.  Maintain fastball arm speed.  
       6.  Pronate gently to add some arm-side movement.  
       7.  Allow the fingers to “slip” rather than push, further reducing spin and velocity.  
       8.  The pitch loses approximately ten miles per hour relative to the fastball and shows a blend of run and drop.

XXVII. PALMBALL – Ultra-slow change-up.  
       Purpose: Produce maximum timing disruption when an extra-large speed gap is needed.  
       1.  Press the baseball deep into the palm so that the pads of all four fingers wrap around the top of the ball.  
       2.  Wrap the thumb around the bottom edge.  
       3.  Keep fingertip pressure light; allow the palm to cradle most of the weight.  
       4.  Deliver with the same arm speed and arm slot as the fastball.  
       5.  Keep the wrist relaxed and avoid any snap.  
       6.  Release by letting the entire hand “roll” the ball out.  
       7.  The ball leaves at sixty-five to seventy-five miles per hour, with a gentle sinking action and enormous velocity separation.

XXVIII. KNUCKLEBALL – Spin-less flutter pitch.  
       Purpose: Create erratic, unpredictable movement that confuses the hitter, catcher, and umpire alike.  
       1.  Dig the tips—or full knuckles—of two, three, or four fingers into the leather of the baseball’s surface.  
       2.  Support the ball lightly with the thumb either underneath or to the side.  
       3.  Keep the grip gentle, exerting just enough force to balance the ball until release.  
       4.  Use a smooth, easy delivery rather than maximum effort.  
       5.  Maintain a stiff wrist throughout the throwing motion.  
       6.  Push the ball forward with the fingers, ensuring that all gripping points release simultaneously to minimize spin.  
       7.  The ball exits at sixty to seventy miles per hour with near-zero spin, causing it to flutter unpredictably.

PRACTICE AND PATIENCE REMINDER
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Perfecting any pitch grip requires repeated trial and error.  Hand size, finger length, pressure points, wrist mobility, and personal comfort all change the outcome.  Persist with bullpens and flat-ground sessions, observe the resulting movement, adjust finger spacing, pressure, and ball depth, and remember that some elite professionals, such as Trevor Bauer with his sweeper, needed multiple seasons of experimentation before they could command a new grip in competition.
