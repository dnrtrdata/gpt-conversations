Can you isolate and name all the pitches (by pitch-type -- as in "fast ball", "breaking ball", et cetera) that any of the announcers included in their commentary?

I. Pitch Types Thrown by DJ Jablonski (as identified by announcers):

A. Fastball  
- Referred to as "another fastball" and "sneaky fast"  
- Commentators praised his use of late life and deception  
- Mentioned as the pitch that got "blown by Lappy":contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

B. Breaking Ball  
- Referred to directly as "breaking ball" and "Frisbee for a curveball"  
- A key part of his early strikeout arsenal and late-inning punch-outs:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

C. Changeup  
- Identified multiple times, including as the pitch that "hung" and was hit for a home run by Lewis Lappy  
- Also praised later as a "really good pitch" that fooled batters:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

D. Offspeed (unspecified)  
- Used broadly in commentary to describe pitches slower than his fastball  
- Includes mix-ups described as "offspeed beaten into the ground" or "offspeed popped up":contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

II. Summary of Noted Usage:
- Mix of four pitch categories: fastball, curveball, changeup, generic offspeed.
- Emphasis on changing speeds and movement more than overpowering velocity.
- Noted by announcers as “a Craftsman” with in-out, up-down location control and offspeed deception:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

Can you recreate the entire transcript of actual playtime (in sections, one inning-per-section), correcting any likely spelling or punctuation errors/inconsistencies? This would exclude any intro/outro sections, commentary about any of the coaches-or-players' families or any content not directly related to the baseball being played in real-time (real-time accurate to the time the commentary is being given). This would also exclude any mention of ambience (e.g. music or crowd noise, et cetera)? Also, you can exclude labeling the content by who is speaking (e.g., Announcer or Umpire, et cetera)?

If so, please respond with the largest possible version of Section 1 and quantize the pitches-per-batter so that it is clear WHAT KIND OF PITCH (fastball or breaking ball, et cetera) is thrown -- and any fair hit labeled as the hit-type (line-drive, pop-fly, et cetera). If a hit is caught, include where on the field it was caught. Also, separate the batters/pitchers so that each team's pitcher received his own section. This way, we'll be able to determine (for every pitch): the pitching team, which pitcher is pitching, and what pitch is being thrown.

I'd like each response you give to cover an entire inning (both top and bottom).
