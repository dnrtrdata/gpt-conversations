That's much better. It's already more useful. One more adjustment, though... use the following text ONLY as a template for your categories and terminology -- don't take any of the info. I'd like the example document and our document to follow mostly the same format and section conventions:


# UE5GamePlan_DontForget

## Getting Started with Unreal Engine 5.4

### Setting Up Your Project
1. **Utilize Blueprints**: Use Unreal Engine's Blueprints, a visual scripting tool that allows you to create game logic without writing code.
2. **Blueprint Interfaces**: Implement Blueprint Interfaces to promise behaviors to objects without specifying implementation details.
    - Note: Define a set of functions that different Blueprints can implement, ensuring they promise certain behaviors without detailing how they achieve them. This creates a contract that ensures predictable interaction.

## Blueprints and Visual Scripting

### Core Concepts
1. **Event Graph**: Use the Event Graph for runtime logic and understand how to add and connect nodes to define your blueprint's behavior. Familiarize yourself with common events like `Event BeginPlay` and `Event Tick` to trigger actions at the start of the game or every frame.
    - Note: Common events include `Event OnClicked`, `Event OnOverlapBegin`, `Event OnOverlapEnd`, `Event AnyDamage`, `Event ActorBeginOverlap`, `Event ActorEndOverlap`, `Event Possessed`, `Event Destroyed`, and `Event OnHit`. These events help you react to various interactions and changes in the game environment.
2. **Variables**: Create and use variables (getters and setters) to store and manipulate data in your blueprints. Practice creating dynamic behavior, such as updating variables over time, to simulate game mechanics.
    - Note: Use integers for counting items or tracking scores, floats for health values or timers, booleans for true/false conditions, vectors for position or direction, and strings for storing text data. Arrays of these types are useful for managing lists.

### Advanced Blueprint Techniques
1. **Interaction and Logic**: Utilize For Each loops to check overlapping actors and implement interaction logic in a decoupled manner. Implement the Observer pattern to allow different objects in your game to communicate and share information in a scalable and maintainable way.
    - Note: Use `For Each Loop` nodes to iterate through collections of overlapping actors and create an event dispatcher to broadcast events. Bind other Blueprints to this dispatcher to react to events, facilitating communication without direct links.
2. **Event Dispatchers and Bind Functions**: Use event dispatchers in Blueprints to broadcast signals when events occur and have other objects react to these signals. Bind functions to specific events to react to changes and update the game state accordingly.
3. **Organization and Experimentation**: Keep your blueprints organized and clean by using comments and separating logic into manageable sections. Don't hesitate to experiment with different approaches, as this will deepen your understanding and problem-solving abilities.
    - Note: Use comments, break down logic into functions and macros, use `Reroute` nodes for tidy wires, color-code nodes, name and categorize variables, and regularly clean up Blueprints.
4. **Blueprint Utilities and Node Libraries**: Take advantage of Unreal Engine's Blueprint utilities and explore various Blueprint node libraries to enhance your game development capabilities.
    - Note: Familiarize yourself with node libraries like Math Library, Array Library, String Library, Gameplay Statics, Actor Library, Input Library, and Timeline for efficient implementation.
5. **PCG Integration**: Connect blueprints to Procedural Content Generation (PCG) graphs to control variables and generate dynamic content in real-time.
    - Note: Use PCG graphs to sample landscape data and create dynamic environments. Use the static mesh spawner for procedural object placement, and create variables in Blueprints to control PCG properties like seed values.

## Animation

### Animation Techniques
1. **Retargeting and Efficient Animation Transfer**: Unreal Engine 5.4 introduces a new retargeting system that simplifies the process of copying animations between different character skeletons, allowing you to retarget animations to any supported skeletal mesh in less than five minutes.
    - Note: Use the new retargeting system to transfer animations between different skeletons quickly, preserving root motion and complex layers like facial expressions and hand movements.
2. **Motion Matching**: Use motion matching for realistic animation transitions, allowing smoother and more natural movement in characters.
    - Note: Record various swimming animations and use motion matching to dynamically select the best animation pose, ensuring smooth and natural transitions in your underwater game.

## User Interface

### Common UI Plugin
1. **Setup and Styles**: Enable the Common UI plugin to add new functionalities to your UI. Create presets for border styles, button styles, and text styles to ensure consistency across your UI.
    - Note: Create presets for consistent UI elements, allowing easy global changes and maintaining a cohesive look and feel.
2. **Dynamic UI Management**: Use the common activatable widget stack to stack widgets on top of each other, managing complex UI interactions easily. Implement dynamic UI elements that update in real-time based on game events and player interactions.

## Procedural Content Generation (PCG)

### Integrating PCG with Blueprints
1. **Sampling and Spawning**: Use the PCG graph to sample landscape data and create dynamic environments. Use the static mesh spawner in PCG to place objects in your environment.
    - Note: Sample landscape data to create evolving environments and use the static mesh spawner for procedural object placement, ensuring a natural and varied distribution of assets.
2. **Controlling and Updating Variables**: Create variables in your blueprint to control PCG properties like seed values for randomization. Implement real-time updates to your PCG setups using blueprint logic to create dynamic and evolving game worlds.
    - Note: Define variables to control PCG properties and adjust seed values in real-time for unique playthroughs. Use Blueprint logic for real-time environmental updates based on player actions.

## Project Planning and Management

### Best Practices
1. **Planning and Prototyping**: Clearly define your game's concept and objectives to guide your learning and development. Use tools like Milano to organize your game development process, including creating a game design document (GDD) and setting milestones. Focus on developing and refining the core mechanics of your game before expanding to other features.
2. **Optimization and Playtesting**: Use profiling tools to find performance problems, optimize assets, and reduce draw calls for better performance. Gather feedback from playtesters early in development to identify and fix issues before they become major problems.
3. **Marketing and Version Control**: Start marketing your game early by creating a Steam page, posting on social media, and engaging with your target audience. Implement a version control system like Git and GitHub to manage your project's changes and collaborate with others effectively.

## Learning and Development

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Consistency and Courses**: Dedicate a small amount of time each day to learning and practicing, even if it's just 20 minutes. Enroll in comprehensive courses to get structured learning and step-by-step guidance.
2. **Experimentation and Community**: Don’t just follow tutorials; experiment with creating small projects on your own. Engage with online communities, such as Discord groups, where you can ask questions, share progress, and get support from other developers.
3. **Game Jams and Debugging**: Participate in game jams to gain practical experience and learn how to work under time constraints. Learn how to debug your code effectively to ensure everything works as intended.
4. **Familiarity and AI Tools**: Understand the layout and components of the Blueprint Editor to navigate and utilize its features effectively. Utilize AI tools to generate concept art and convert it into 3D models for consistent character design in your game.
5. **Common UI Plugin and Auto Landscape Material**: Use the Common UI plugin to manage UI elements more efficiently, allowing you to create reusable styles and stackable widgets. Create and use auto landscape materials to automatically apply textures based on the slope and angle of the terrain, saving time and ensuring consistency.

2. **Hash Functions**: Implement hash functions to generate random output values for procedural patterns. This ensures that each input always produces the same output, which is essential for consistency in procedural generation.

### Practical Example
1. **Example: Implementing Voronoi Patterns**:
    - **Set Up Grid Cells**: Use Blueprints to divide the screen into grid cells and generate random offsets for each cell using a hash function.
    - **Calculate Distances**: Use Blueprints to calculate the distance from each pixel to the nearest point, then shade the pixels based on these distances to create the Voronoi pattern.

## Advanced Procedural Generation Techniques

### Voronoi Edges Algorithm
1. **Creating Voronoi Edges**: Use the Voronoi edges algorithm to create intricate patterns with defined edges between cells. This involves finding the positions of points, calculating the closest point to each pixel, and shading based on edge distances.
2. **Dot Product for Distance Calculation**: Implement the dot product to project vectors and calculate distances to edges. This helps create smooth transitions and accurate shading between cells.

### Practical Example
1. **Example: Implementing Voronoi Edges**:
    - **Set Up Points and Grid Cells**: Use Blueprints to generate points within grid cells and calculate distances between points and pixels.
    - **Calculate Edge Distances**: Use the dot product in Blueprints to determine the distance to the nearest edge for each pixel and shade accordingly.

### Artistic Applications

#### Smoothing and Animating Patterns
1. **Smooth Voronoi Edges**: Use a smoothing function to soften the sharp geometric corners of Voronoi edges, creating a more organic look. Implement this in Blueprints by adjusting the minimum distance calculations.
2. **Animating Patterns**: Introduce sine waves and time-based offsets to animate Voronoi patterns smoothly. Use Blueprints to update the offsets over time, creating dynamic and flowing visual effects.

### Lighting and Texturing

#### Adding Lighting Effects
1. **Diffuse and Specular Lighting**: Model diffuse and specular lighting using the Phong reflection model to add realistic light effects to your Voronoi patterns. Use Blueprints to calculate light directions, dot products, and reflections.
2. **Using Cube Maps**: Apply cube maps to simulate reflections and distance environments. Use Blueprints to handle cube map textures and mix them with the base color for realistic effects.

#### Practical Example
1. **Example: Adding Lighting to Voronoi Patterns**:
    - **Set Up Light Sources**: Create Blueprint nodes to define light positions and directions. Calculate diffuse and specular lighting based on surface normals and light vectors.
    - **Apply Textures**: Use cube maps and texture sampling nodes in Blueprints to add detailed textures and reflections to the Voronoi patterns.

This section covers advanced techniques for procedural generation using Voronoi edges, with practical examples of implementation and artistic applications using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5.4.

Adjust the following text to apply to an entirely-undersea game using a blue whale as an example of the creature needed to climb on and a diver with the limitations of undersea movement applied to the scenario; then describe how to create this functionality using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5 and add the info to the document. **IMPORTANT** Parse all data and complete all tasks in this one request entirely in-the-background, then return to our previous tasks for links added. Here is the aforementioned text:
you can start by making a pawn that can run on 2 legs, or when a button is held, crawl on the floor with all 4 limbs. every limb in use needs to have IK targets that you can blend into, and climb animations with anim events that decide when to grab or release with each hand, shooting ray traces to check the materials surface type, spawn footprints, play footstep sounds, check if the surface type can be found in a list of climbable surface types, interpolate the rotation of the skeletal mesh towards the surface normal, check if mesh rotation is too steep to climb/walk, set the location of the IK target for the free arm, play the climb animation while blending in that IK, and when the free arm reaches the target, turn off IK for the other hand, then change the location of the pawn’s pivot point, without changing the location of everything else.

the IK targets can be an actor that is spawned like a bullet hole decal, attaching it to the bone of a deforming joint. this might give you sliding problems on organic parts, but might work fine for hard surface parts, and im not sure how you would skin it to the surface of the mesh, unless you can store the UV coordinate, and translate that into the 3D location every frame somehow.

to get swinging to work, you would need to either use a physics constraint on the skeletal mesh, with physical animation, or you could have a second invisible simpler skeletal mesh that holds all your IK targets, and controls your visible mesh like a puppet, and use a physics constraint to attach it to the monster.

with the crazy swinging that a monster climbing game creates, you should probably make the camera part of a separate actor, that averages the pawns position with some other actors on a list of look at targets, then you can move these other actors in front of the player to get the camera looking dynamically. the camera should rotate relative to the gravity direction, you can do this with vector math, or maybe hang the camera rig from a physics constraint.

this is a very complicated system to create.

Getting Started
Setting Up Your Project

Create a New Project: Open Unreal Engine 5 and create a new project using the third-person template to get started with the basics.

Blueprint Selection: Ensure you select the Blueprint option to focus on visual scripting, making the development process more accessible.

Blueprints and Visual Scripting
Core Concepts

Blueprint Classes: Understand that Blueprints are like your recipe cards, containing all the logic and components for your game objects.

Components and Viewport: The Blueprint editor is where you add and modify components like character models, cameras, and collision settings.

Basic Navigation

Component Section: This section includes the main components like the character mesh, capsule collision, and camera. Adjust and add components as needed.

Details Panel: Displays properties for selected components such as position, rotation, and specific settings.

Event Graph and Construction Script

Event Graph: Define your game logic here by placing visual nodes that control the behavior of your Blueprints.

Construction Script: Use this to set up components and other logic that runs before gameplay starts.

Variables and Functions

Creating Variables: Store data like health, score, or other values. Choose the appropriate type (Boolean, float, integer) for your variable.

Functions and Events: Group your logic into functions and events to keep your Blueprints organized and manageable.

Practical Example: Flashlight Toggle

Setting Up the Flashlight: Add a spotlight component to your character, name it "Flashlight," and adjust its position and intensity.

Blueprint Logic: Create an event to toggle the flashlight's visibility using a FlipFlop node to switch the light on and off with a key press.

Advanced Blueprint Techniques
Parenting Components

Attach Components: Ensure components move correctly with the character by attaching them to the character's bones.

Organizing with Comments

Use Comments: Label sections of your Blueprint with comments to keep your work organized and easy to understand.

Custom Events and Functions

Creating Custom Events: Add custom events to trigger specific actions in your Blueprints.

Using Functions: Create functions for complex logic that needs to be reused, keeping your main Event Graph clean.

Lighting and Atmosphere
Introduction to Lighting

Enable Lumen: Go to your project settings and enable Lumen for dynamic global illumination and reflections.

Project Settings: Adjust settings in the rendering tab to ensure Lumen is properly configured.

Practical Lighting Setup

Directional Light: Use a directional light for simulating sunlight or moonlight. Adjust its angle to change the time of day.

Point Light: Use point lights for indoor environments to simulate light bulbs.
