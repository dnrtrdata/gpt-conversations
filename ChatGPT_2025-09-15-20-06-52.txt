• Walk-outs and a 6-minute ovation at Cannes triggered #EddingtonDebate on X; half the fun is taking sides.  
• Joaquin Phoenix’s sardonic sheriff, Pedro Pascal’s mask-mandate mayor, and Emma Stone’s conspiracist spouse form a prestige-actor trifecta rarely found in a $25 M picture.  
• Darius Khondji’s 35 mm vistas and Austin Butler’s “viral guru” cameo fuel trailer re-watches and meme-GIFs.
