According tothe following transcript, how would the author start making an Amazon KDP from scratch inn 2025?

so over the years I've made over $1.5

million in actual royalties with Amazon

KDP these are some of the income reports

that I've done in the past and you can

see that I was averaging between $3 to

$35,000 a month sometimes even 40K in a

month from my KDP account so I've had a

business that was generating multiple

six figures a year which I eventually

sold for $820,000 and now I'm building

my new KDP account which is once again

up to a six figure a year run rate so

this is going a little slower than my

first account just because with my first

account I was working on it fulltime

like literally just focusing on that

this one I'm trying to see how much I

can build while spending as little time

as possible so I got a team uh basically

spending like less than 30 minutes a

week on it but it's still doing around

$10 to $20,000 a month if you count KDP

also the audiobooks and other channels

as well and we are trying to grow it

from here and as always if you don't

believe anything I say I documented

everything for the past couple years

just go to Shawn doit KDP income reports

and you will see all my previous income

reports there so KDP allowed me to

travel the world I've been to Bali

Thailand you know China and many many

other places but most importantly I've

helped hundreds of others to do the same

right to be able to build a KDP business

to the point where they're making

part-time income or even replace their

full-time job and do this full-time and

achieve more freedom but the thing is

times are changing right I started this

business in 2016 and what worked before

doesn't really work anymore so you know

really the business itself is changing

uh so was every single other business as

well not just in KDP uh because of AI

and Technology right so AI is absolutely

disrupting the game both good and bad

ways uh so we must update our strategies

you know KDP is still an amazing

business right it still works I would

say it is still to this day one of the

best business to start but the way we

approach this business must be updated

as well so in this video I'll show you

what you must do to go from zero to Mak

it over 100k with Amazon KDP and before

we start if you want an 80-minute master

class on how I buil a KDP business

business to this level besides of this

training right I have another free

training if you guys want to check it

out the link is below this video all

right so the first thing I would do is I

would focus on high demand niches so a

lot of people would teach you to Niche

down so much to the point where you

barely have any competition and they say

it's good because you can rank much

easier but the thing is if you Niche

down so much to the point where there's

absolutely zero competition the topic

and the keyword is probably not that

profitable right because competition

really shows how profitable it is you

know it's profitable and that's why a

lot of people are doing it so the way

you want to approach this honestly is

you want to focus Less on competition

and more on demand demand is extremely

important right demand is how many

people are looking for the topic you

know and how profitable it is so low

competition is important but demand

comes first you have to find a topic

that is very very profitable and then if

you find something that's also low

competition that's amazing but it

matters less right though as an example

right this brand right here kite Fox

publishing uh publishes books in the

topic of stress relief adult calling

book mindfulness word search 2024 word

search very very broad topics it's not

low competition everybody knows these

keywords right Anxiety Relief word

search for those everyone's doing it and

yet this brand is making over

$68,000 a month in Revenue same as this

brand Elizabeth Cole publishing books on

children's stories or children's books

right uh that teaches a lesson so I'm

stronger than anxiety so book on

teaching kids uh to you know manage

anxiety manage anger here uh body

boundaries Etc like a lot of people are

doing the same thing and yet she makes

over

$53,000 a month just from paperback not

counting the audiobook which is kind of

small but a couple thousand more from

Kindle obviously she has the hard cover

version with an additional $99,000 a

month in Revenue so she's doing really

well and the last one is Dana K white so

she publishes books on decluttering

everybody knows about decluttering I use

this as an example many many times and

yet she does $8,000 a month from just a

few books right and another $2,000 a

month from just one book in hard cover

she does an extra

$37,000 from Audiobook and another

$3,000 so she's doing about $50,000 a

month in Revenue as well so my point is

this all these big successful Publishers

they never focused on finding low

competition keyword just so they can go

and avoid everyone else right instead

what they did is just went into the same

keyword everyone else is going into but

they made a better book they just

focused on creating a better quality

book and marketing it better so this is

why in my opinion competition matters

less right because Amazon algorithm

heavily favors quality books so it

really doesn't matter if there are

50,000 other books out there because

49,99 books of the 50,000 I can

guarantee that they're crap right most

people are doing the bare minimum right

like most people are watching side

hustle videos on YouTube you know

pumping out journals that they copy

pasted from canva or something and they

expect to make money with zero reviews

zero marketing right so you know what

you want to do is not to do the same

thing and then try to compete by just

having a brand new keyword nobody else

is going into instead just going into

the same keyword that we know is

profitable right and just make a better

book and do proper marketing like

getting reviews and sales so I want to

talk about quality versus quantity right

obviously quality is super super super

important way more than quantity you

know if you have to choose one you

always go with quality but it does not

mean that you should invest everything

into one book right there is something

magical about a KDP business if you have

a lot of books right all those books

making little bit here a little bit

there it adds up so the goal should be

to publish as many high quality books as

possible right because you don't want to

just focus on super high quality book

and you don't want to just have this one

book mindset and just publish one book

but also you don't want to just go with

a quantity approach and publish a bunch

of crap book you need a middle ground

and that is why I say publish as many

high quality book as possible but the

thing is most people have no idea what

quality even is right and that is why

you got to practice with publishing

multiple books so your first book always

going to suck right but that's fine you

know you're going to understand if it's

good if it's bad right quality wise and

then you keep publishing to the point

where you eventually start getting

feedbacks uh of four and five star

reviews then you know that that is the

quality that people are looking for and

then you want to publish as many books

as you can in the quality level next

thing you got to keep in mind is that

literally everyone can create content

now right so once again AI is making it

easier than ever to publish a book which

is amazing if you're just getting

started because it's a lower barrier of

Entry like you know it's a lot easier

for you to go and publish a book now

compared to many many years ago right

which is great it's easier for you to

start but the con is that everybody else

is doing it as well so it's easier for

you to start but doesn't mean that you

should stay at the level putting the

bare minimum right just you know asking

chat GPD for something copy pasting it

into a book that is like the bare

minimum of what everyone else is doing

right so you can start with that you can

probably make you know 10 bucks a month

50 bucks a month 100 bucks a month from

a book right but you know if you want to

make thousands a month if you want to

really make lifechanging income then you

don't want to stay there right you want

to keep improving your craft so once

again the pro of you know AI becoming

mainstream is that you can create a book

very easily right so it's easier for

people to start but the con is that just

making content is not going to do

anything you have to do marketing right

the way you stand out is not by creating

content it's by marketing the book

getting reviews getting sales once again

let me show you some examples so this is

the type of book that literally everyone

else is making right bedtime story book

for kids AI generated cover looks kind

of nice right AI does create some nice

images but all they did is upload and

forget no reviews nothing right so the

fact that everyone can now make book

covers like this is amazing but the

thing is that's the thing everyone can

do it so you have to do more than that

so if you want to stand out you got to

learn marketing getting reviews once

again and getting sales you cannot be

doing what everyone else is doing and

expect to make any significant money

because here's the thing even if you go

and find an untapped keyword that nobody

else is in right and you publish in it

yes you'll make money for a while but I

can almost guarantee that if you publish

a crap book right it's only a matter of

time until somebody else discovers the

keyword make a better book your book

dies off compared to that if you publish

a high quality book from the beginning

by the time somebody else finds a

keyword it gets flooded doesn't matter

because your book will always stand out

because it's better than everybody

else's so the bottom line is this it is

so much easier to just make a better

book in a proven keyword than trying to

find an untapped keyword all right so

let's talk about marketing so I keep

saying marketing is important but it's

very very simple it's not this complex

thing that's very overwhelming I promise

you it's very simple right it's as

simple as getting reviews and getting

sales right you want to get reviews

first and then you get sales and it's

essentially bringing more eyeballs to

your books so we call this traffic in

marketing right it's basically getting

more traffic to your product in your

case it's book more people see your book

right you will get more sales So within

the first month of publishing you want

to get to 10 reviews minimum and then

from there uh you want to build it up to

50 reviews or so and if you're

absolutely not making any sales of 50

reviews then the issue could be the

keyword or your book might not be that

good so if that's the case then you can

step back re-evaluate what's the issue

if it's your book if it's a keyword then

you might have to just move on and give

up on that book right you can go and do

a better job on the second book but

until you get 50 reviews you don't know

if it's the book that's bad if it's the

keyword or maybe you just don't have

enough reviews right so reviews are

essential um there are many ways to get

reviews I have plenty of videos on

getting reviews just look up sha thewit

uh reviews and there are many videos

like that but I'll leave a link to this

video in the description it's basically

talking about the easiest way to get

reviews uh so go and check it out if you

want to so once you get enough reviews

next is to show that book to as many

people as possible and that is the

marketing side you got to get the

reviews first because you know if your

book has zero reviews there's no social

proof right you show it to as many

people as possible right no one's going

to buy it because there's no reviews

right so you got to get reviews first so

after you do that then the marketing

right so the fastest way to show your

book to a ton of people is Amazon as

right you just pay a little bit of money

for Amazon to show your book to a ton of

people you get a lot of eyeballs if your

book is attractive you will start making

sales right so that is the fastest way

okay and you can start with as L as $3 a

day now if you don't have money for as

or if you don't want to spend that money

for whatever reason then there is a

freeway which is social media so like

Tik Tok Instagram reals you can promote

your book that way and I have many

videos on that once again so if you need

help on anything all you got to do is

look up Sha doit

topic right so in this case Shawn doit

Tik Tok if you want to learn more about

that and there's a lot of videos on it

or if you want Shawn doit Amazon ads

tutorial I'll leave a link to this video

below this video as well so one thing I

want you guys to understand is that

you're always paying with time or money

right so just because you're not paying

money you know doing social media you're

going to be spending a lot more time

posting content which kind of costs

money right cuz time is money so you

have to choose what you pay you know do

you want to save time by just you know

running Amazon ads or do you want to

save money by doing a lot of social

media me personally I prefer Amazon ads

but you can do both and both is a great

way as well so if you do want to do free

marketing right social media if you want

to learn more about that then once again

there's a video on it I'll leave a link

below this video uh but basically you

make short form viral content promoting

your book and it's as simple as just

filming the book uh on your phone right

I'll give you some examples here so just

to showcase the power of Tik Tok right

so there's a story of a young adult

fiction author right who was doing a

book signing and I think either a

Walmart or a Target some kind of store

right and he was just sitting there and

no one was coming up to him so he looked

very sad right and you know this Tik

talker went into the store randomly saw

him just sitting there uh with his book

and uh kind of looking defeated right so

then he went up filmed a video uh

talking to him just interacting and he

posted that on Tik Tok it went

absolutely viral right and his book went

from 5 million BSR which means he's

making absolutely zero sales to number

one in the entire Amazon Kindle Store

he's making like tens of thousands of

dollars every single day right and it

kind of slowed down since then but he's

still doing crazy good so that is from

one viral video so just the crazy thing

about social media is the potential of

going viral so that's just one example

but specifically what kind of videos can

you make right so all you got to do is

go to Tik Tok and search for you know

whatever book is so if you're doing

calling books search for calling books

right uh and you know if you're doing

something else search for that but as an

example this person Megan miles art uh

is absolutely blowing up right now her

books are blowing up on Amazon she has

an extremely simple book like literally

everyone can make this book right and

this is what I mean by you know when I

say everyone can be a content creator

but you got to learn marketing because

her books are there's nothing special

about this like literally anyone can

make this interior image right like even

if you're outsourc it it's like three

bucks per page you know and you can make

it yourself too obviously but she's

doing like 50 60k even more a month in

Revenue right and what she's doing is

Tik Tok marketing so she posted daily

consistently uh and all she's doing is

showing her books right she ordered it

you know filmed herself just going

through the book on a phone hund like

flipping through it 179,000 views right

and a lot of sales from that this one

she's just flipping through her page or

I guess she's calling it in right kind

of like ASMR uh but with calling books

and that is very very popular now on Tik

Tok 3.5 million views this one right

here is once again same kind of style

right she just flipping through it and

that's a video 6.6 million views insane

right so uh you can definitely do Tik

Tok very very powerful especially if you

got coling books and those kind of books

but the point is just look it up on Tik

Tok there's a lot of examples of how you

can make these videos and if you're

worried about Tik Tok shutting down

because it was was on the news um don't

worry because Tik Tok is just one method

right if Tik Tok shuts down people who

watch these short form content they're

going to go somewhere else right like

the short form content is not going to

die just because Tik Tok dies no they're

going to just go to Instagram reals

Maybe YouTube shorts maybe there's

another social media channel that's

going to pop up doesn't matter right but

bottom line the need for Content like

this will always stay right so if you

know how to make it you can just go to

another social media site all right so

the next thing I would do is to focus on

building authority so you know building

authority is basically just becoming an

expert on the topic right so in order to

become an expert on whatever Niche

whatever topic that you're publishing uh

in you cannot hop around into different

niches you cannot publish a book on this

topic and you cannot go and you know

just try another Niche right that's

hopping around uh if you do that you're

never going to be an expert right so

basically you want to focus on one Niche

go as deep as possible until people

recognize that you're the go-to brand

right or or the expert in the niche so

become an expert on the topic serve the

audience right and this is how you can

go from just being a publisher to a

full-blown business let me show you some

examples so this brand right here zenful

note right they started off with

publishing this book Shadow work Journal

okay and she kind of took the same

approach as the the last uh Tik Tok

channel that we saw right she just

posted daily and it just blew up it's

insane once again because these videos

are getting 68 million views it's just

I'm just like blown away every time I

talk about this all she's doing is

filming one page of her video and

reading the exercise out loud she's not

even doing the exercise nothing she's

literally just reading it 68 million

views insane right but what she did

right was she was consistent she was

posting every single day right and she

still posts every single day and her

average views are just a couple thousand

right so it's not like you know she

always gets million views you can do the

same thing and if you're getting a

couple thousand some of those videos

will pop and it's just going to blow up

and it can absolutely be life-changing

but if you look at her Channel now she's

selling a lot more than just this book

right so obviously she started selling

another book like you know uh Second

Edition and uh more books in the series

but she's also selling a some kind of

card like a Terra card or whatever it is

right and she's also coming up with an

app so this is what I mean is that once

you have a brand established once you

become an authority you can become a

full-blown business not just a publisher

you can start selling backend offers

right from your books so basically the

book is how people find you but from

there you can sell additional stuff

right physical products even coaching

offers even your courses and you can

make a lot more money there and that's

not going to happen unless you establish

yourself as an authority so when it

comes to building an authority in the

niche you don't need to be an amazing

writer right it's not about your writing

style it's more so about providing value

and unique insights right so just focus

on one Niche so you can understand your

customer because you've been in the

niche for so long that you know what

people are looking for right once you

get to the point then all you got to do

is try and give people what they want in

your book as much as possible and it's

as simple as that until you become an

authority on it so the next thing I

would do uh is to build a team from the

start so I would focus on Outsourcing

tasks that I am not good at from the

very very beginning so you can do

everything in this business for free

which is one of the the amazing thing

about publishing right it's the biggest

benefit but it does not mean that you

should right just because you can do

things for free does not mean that you

should okay focus on what you're good at

you want to hire out the rest so as I

said earlier you're always paying with

either time or money right just because

you can save money by doing the things

yourself uh does not mean that it's good

because you're spending so much more

time like a lot of people design book

covers on canva and they spend literally

days making a book cover that ends up

being worse than what they could have

got from Fiverr for five bucks or 10

bucks paying somebody else to do it so

if you're in the US and if you want to

think about what your time is worth

right even if you're making minimum wage

paying somebody 5 10 20 bucks for a book

cover instead of spending days making it

I think is a very good investment so

once again my new KDP account is back to

six figures a year and I spend less than

an hour a week on it so one of the first

thing you should Outsource is the book

cover right I started with paying five

bucks per cover right and that amount

increased as business grew you know I

started making more money that I

reinvested in a better cover designer

and then a better cover designer and now

I pay between $100 to $200 per book

cover but obviously you don't have to

start off that way right like 5 10 20

bucks some of the recommended Fiverr

gigs that I have in this video which I

will link below this video can create a

really really high quality cover for you

know 5 to 20 bucks okay so I have a

video on it once again check it out but

you know it will take me hours to make a

cover on canva that is worse than what I

could get for five bucks on Fiverr so

obviously it's kind of a no-brainer uh

to Outsource it rather than just

spending your time unless you want to

learn design skills unless you you're

happy doing it then you know by all

means do it so again as an example this

is one of the gig that I work with uh

for a very very long time it's $10 and

you can see the designs are really

really good you still have to work with

them go back and forth right so it's not

like you know it's guaranteed amazing

every single time but it's unlimited

revisions meaning if you're not happy

just don't accept it right so you can

work with them make as many changes as

possible until you're happy with it okay

so as you can see she does well with

fiction books non-fiction as well cuz I

do non-fiction I work with her many many

times but this is another one if you

want to focus on non-fiction type of

book covers so she charged 30 bucks

right and she does really good designs

like these are amazing right so that's

another one I'll leave a link to these

gigs below this video and I've worked

with her as well if you want more of a

premium option uh she charge definitely

higher as you can see but her designs

are absolutely amazing okay so this is

another option once again I'll leave a

link to the video okay and then also

these gigs Below in the description but

honestly you don't have to use these

book cover designers right all you have

to do is go to Fiverr right and look at

book cover and there are a lot more gigs

that you can go and obviously just check

out the samples pick the one you like

and then go from there so Fiverr is

amazing but there's another site that's

really really good and that is upwork

and this is where you can hire writers

uh illustrators and vas and if you're

looking for those kind of tasks then

upwork is my favorite place to do so and

you can manage your team directly on the

platform as well so I'll leave a link to

upwork below this video but basically if

you're trying to hire ghost riders uh if

you're trying to hire illustrators for

custom illustrations or if you just want

a virtual assistant for your business

upwork is a great place you can do that

on five or two but upwork is my

preference in terms of the rates that

you want for Ghost Riders it depends on

the topic but typically I pay $2 to $3

per 100 words so that means if you have

a 30,000 word book which is about 150

Pages then your book will be anywhere

between $600 to $900 to get it written

and this is uh if you want quality right

so for illustration you can pay between

three bucks for a very very simple uh

illustration up to $20 per page uh if

you want a full color full background as

well so that kind of depends but

typically I pay between three to five

bucks and for VAs that's like 4 to eight

bucks an hour or so so almost every

single step in the business can be

Outsource once again writing cover

design formatting reviews ads and much

more if you want to learn how I automate

99% of my KDP business I filmed a video

on exactly how I do that so I will once

again leave a link below this video so

you might be thinking I don't have money

to Outsource books or run ads right what

do I do well if that's the case once

again there's a free alternative to

literally everything so you can write

the books you can do your own social

media marketing right and you can start

off with that no problem but the thing

is the issue is that people get stuck

there you know they never evolve past

that phase because they're scared of

investing the money right they're scared

of you know perhaps losing it but the

thing is the point of Outsourcing it is

that you can publish a book quicker so

that you can make back the money and so

much more because you're never going to

make money unless you publish a book

right but because people are scared of

Outsourcing or perhaps just you know

they take so long to do things themsel

they end up giving up before they even

publish a book I just don't want you to

do that right if you can publish a book

doing it yourself just to see this works

and you start actually making money

that's great right but take that profit

and reinvest into getting a better book

cover next time right and you make more

money from that take that profit and get

a better formatter right and take that

profit and now have somebody run ads for

you right and you eventually scale your

business that way so you don't have to

start with having teams and systems but

you should work towards it all right so

next thing I recommend is you don't want

to ignore audiobooks uh because you know

paperback Kindle those are great but

audiobook is honestly just blowing up

right now so audiobook as you can see

from this chart is a growing market

right it'll only keep growing as more

people who's reading ebooks paperback is

going to start switching over to

audiobook because it's just more

convenient you can see that we're here

in 2024 okay it's projected to Triple in

Market size in six years by 2030 okay

and it's just going to keep going from

there so this is kind of another reason

why you want to focus on high content

books because if you're doing low

content books or if you're doing like

coling books you can only publish your

book in paperback or hard cover maybe

right uh you cannot do ebook you you

cannot do audio and you're missing out

on a lot so you can definitely do you

know those kind of books but if you want

the biggest money long-term typically

it's from high content books okay and

also it'll be free to create an

audiobook soon uh thanks to AI A6 is

already coming up with a you know AI

narration beta thing so you can start

turning your book into an audiobook with

AI it sounds pretty legit and it's

completely free so there's like no

reason not to do it as an example we got

Christine one of our students right she

made 10 K in a month from ACX which is

audio right alone not counting the KDP

sale she made which is like another

$44,000 Nicolo over here made

$58,000 in July right 50k came from KDP

and

$8,300 in additional income came from

audiobooks so I got a whole video on how

to do audiobooks so once again I'll

leave a link below this video all right

so the next thing I would definitely not

neglect and I'm mentioning these things

like audiobook and also bundles is

because a lot of you guys don't do this

right nobody really talks about this

which I don't understand why but bundles

is absolutely a GameChanger because it's

a free book right you already have your

book files so you're just putting it

together and you can sell it as a whole

new book which is a kind of a bundle or

you know box set so you can see here we

got two crochet book you put it together

sell it as a crochet twoin one bundle so

bundles are literally free to make it

sells better because it's a better uh

value for the customer like it's it's

cheaper for the customer to buy a bundle

than buying one book individually at a

time right so you make more Sales Plus

you can price it higher so you make more

royalties per sale it's better deal for

the customer and it's literally free to

make like it's a win-win-win type of

thing like there's no downsizes to it so

you really should be taking advantage of

bundles so people in the high content

space know bundles is a thing like a lot

of people do it but for some reason

people in the low content medium content

space they don't know that bundles are

even a thing I don't understand why I

think a lot of people believe that

bundles are not allowed in low content

for some reason I don't know why but

just to show you that it's it's

completely allowed right and it's

actually doing extremely well these are

some examples so this is a brain game

three books in one bundle right so they

had these three books all they did is

put it together sell it as a new book

now look at this you know I got this

book beam plugin so you got to pay for

book beam but it's really cool because

it shows you the SMA roties and stuff uh

if you want to check out book beam the

link is below this video but it's

showing me that it's making 55 to6 $6 a

day in royalties that's 1,500 bucks a

month right from a free book that you

made which is pretty crazy right same as

Based on the transcript, the author would start making an Amazon KDP business from scratch in 2025 by following these key steps:

1. **Focus on High-Demand Niches**  
   - Instead of niching down excessively, choose broad, profitable topics with proven demand.
   - Competition is less important than demand—successful publishers enter popular spaces and create better books.

2. **Publish as Many High-Quality Books as Possible**  
   - Quality matters more than quantity, but having multiple high-quality books increases earnings.
   - Expect early books to be imperfect; improve based on feedback and reviews.
   - AI can help generate content, but low-effort books won’t stand out.

3. **Master Marketing (Getting Reviews and Sales)**  
   - Reviews provide social proof; aim for at least 10 in the first month and 50 overall.
   - Use Amazon Ads for fast visibility or free marketing via TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.
   - Viral content can dramatically boost sales.

4. **Build Authority in a Niche**  
   - Stick to a single niche to establish expertise and brand recognition.
   - Once a strong brand is built, expand into products beyond books (e.g., courses, coaching, merchandise).

5. **Outsource Tasks from the Start**  
   - Delegate cover design, writing, formatting, and marketing to save time.
   - Fiverr and Upwork are recommended platforms for hiring freelancers.
   - Invest earnings into improving future books rather than doing everything solo.

6. **Maximize Distribution (Audiobooks and Bundles)**  
   - Audiobooks are a growing market and can be created with AI narration.
   - Bundling existing books into multi-book collections increases revenue with minimal effort.
   - Sell in all available formats: ebook, paperback, hardcover, and audiobook.

7. **Scale the Business Efficiently**  
   - Use profits to reinvest in higher-quality books, better freelancers, and advertising.
   - Automate and delegate tasks to reduce time spent on the business.
   - Continue testing and refining marketing strategies to sustain long-term success.

By following these steps, the author believes new KDP publishers can grow their business from zero to over $100,000 per year.

According to the following transcript, what might be the easiest way to succeed with Amazon KDP?

so this might possibly be the easiest

way to start making money selling low

content books on Amazon KDP and in this

video I'll show you exactly how to do

this what is up guys welcome back to

another video so if you're new to the

channel my name is Sean and I've built

and so a seven figureure Amazon KDP

business and now I'm building my new KDP

account so if you want no BS publishing

advice from someone who's actually doing

it then make sure to subscribe so I was

just browsing Amazon doing keyword

research a couple days ago and this just

kept popping up Easter basket stuffers

for teens Easter word search One review

and making $57 to $75 a day in actual

royalties Easter notebook composition

journal for girls or boys five reviews

making $72 to

$104 every single day with a extremely

basic book cover Easter basket stuffers

Easter word search large print this book

has a horrible rating 2.2 out of five

only 13 total reviews a very mediocre

book cover and yet it is making

$273 to

$488 a day which is just mind-blowing

once again Easter basket stuffers for

teens Easter word search very basic

cover 25 reviews making $171 to $274 a

day and it's just never ending guys this

one Easter basket stuffer activity book

for kids is making

$696 to

$1,116 every single day in actual

royalties so so many books even books

with very low ratings is absolutely

crushing it and these books are all

self-published through the print on

demand model with the Amazon KDP

platform the beauty of this business

model is you don't have to store

inventory you don't have to deal with

shipping and handling once you make a

sale Amazon prints out the book ship it

to the customer they handle the customer

service they handle everything right so

you just upload a PDF and that is it

there's no sign up fees there's no

monthly subscription fees nothing right

all we have to pay is once we make a

sale we give Amazon a small cut for

doing all the work so I think that's

pretty fair so as you can see all these

books are targeting the upcoming holiday

Easter but if you're watching this video

and perhaps Easter have already passed

don't worry because it's not about how

to make money this upcoming Easter this

video is about the strategy behind it so

you can apply this in every single

future holidays you see even if you miss

Easter there's always the next holiday

and the next holiday and the next one

like Cinco de Mayo or Father's Day or

4th of July and of course Halloween

Christmas and so much more plus plus

next year you can repeat this process

all over again so I usually focus on

creating books on Evergreen topics so it

sells all year round but if you target

every single holiday of the year then

yes Easter might slow down after Easter

but then there's the next holiday so you

will get a sales boost there right and

the sales boost on the next holiday and

the next one and you do that enough

times of the year and your income will

be fairly steady throughout the year and

of course next year you're going to

capitalize on that holiday once again

and let's not forget the crazy amount of

sales you can make for a short short

period of time leading up to the holiday

so how do you actually make these books

well often times you can spy on your

competitor's books just by looking at

the Read sample or just by looking at

their A+ content it showcases the

interior or even looking at the reviews

sometimes people post pictures of the

book in the reviews in this case they

show the Interior right here so we can

get a good idea of how our book should

look like as well now during these

holidays activity books like word

searches sells extremely well and as you

can see this is a word search book the

easiest way to make the books is using a

tool called book bolt so this is how it

looks inside book bolt book bolt has two

features the research section and the

actual creating the book section so you

can actually research these book topics

within book b as well which is pretty

nice so as an example I want to see what

kind of activity books is selling really

well right now so I just put activity

books right here and I've selected the

BSR range to be roughly below 50,000

which is selling pretty good and just

like that we have all the bestselling

activity books on Amazon right now so

once again we got Easter try the laugh

challenge right and if you scroll down a

little bit we got Easter dot markers

Easter word search this is the one that

we just saw right so you can get ideas

directly within book bolt but you could

also go and create these books inside

book bolt as well so you just have to

click on the create tab here and go to

book bolt studio so let's start a new

project so I'll just do paperback

interior call this YouTube okay and for

these word search books you want to do

8.5 by 11 cuz that's the standard size

we're going to do black and white

interior and for the page we'll keep it

at 100 Pages all right so now we can go

and customize each Pages this is up to

you and how you want to customize it but

the best part about book bolt is that

they have a lot of templates that you

can go and choose from right so as I

showed you earlier there is a Easter

Journal selling hundreds of dollars a

day right if you want to do journals you

can literally select a journal here and

then pick how many pages you want and

then apply and you will have five

journal pages right so it's as simple as

that and from there you can customize

the interior even more but the best part

about bookboard is that you can also

create these activity books and these

puzzle books right so we got word search

Sudoku cross word you can even do Easter

crossword right or Easter cryptogram so

there's so many different types of books

you can go into but in our case let's do

word search and let's just select five

pages for now and you can customize the

fonts and the font size you can play

around with this what I would do is uh

you can choose the max words per page

like here as you can see this book has

12 words per page so I'll probably do

the same I would also add yes to the

diagonal words and the rest is really up

to you but the last thing you want to do

is you want to upload the list of words

now this is extremely easy nowadays with

AI so all I did was go to chat GPT and I

asked can you give me a list of 500

Easter related single phrase words now

it doesn't have to be a single phrase

word right you can do a longer phrase

like two three words that's fine but

from here you can see that I literally

got 500 Easter related words within

seconds so all I'm going to do is copy

this and I created a CSV file so you

just have to upload it here and just

like that that within seconds you can

see that I got my own word search puzzle

right here and after that we got an

answer page as well which looks pretty

similar to this so from here to

customize it even more all you have to

do is add a title text and some images

around the corner so what you can do is

make this a little smaller move it in

the

middle and you can come here to text put

heading move it to the

top

so enter your title and obviously this

is too big so you can make this a little

smaller so it

fits and from here you can add different

elements and different Graphics just

like this book did which if you have

your own Graphics then you can

definitely upload it directly to book

bolt and use that or if you want to know

where you can get different Graphics

then one is free pick so free pick is

where you can get graphics for free such

as this one this one would be perfect to

put in the book very very similar to how

this book is doing so free pick is free

but you just have to give credit to the

the website so you know you can put a

little line that says images from free

pick right at the end of the book make

sure to read the website and learn how

you can do that another option is to use

creative Fabrica so creative Fabrica is

a library of a ton of images that you

can use and same thing there are so many

Easter related patterns or different

images that you can download you know

you can either purchase alak cart so a

couple bucks here and there or you can

sign up for the membership and you can

download unlimited images so so next you

can actually create book covers within

bookboard as well so in this case I

started a new project once again YouTube

and you want to make sure that the size

of the book cover matches the size of

the Interior so we're going to do 8.5 x

11 once again and also match the page

count with the interior so our interior

was 100 pages so we're going to do

100 and you can go and start designing

the book cover now if you have some

design skills or if you want to practice

learning how to design a book cover then

you can definitely go and do this

yourself or if you're like me who has

absolutely zero design skills and you

rather just pay somebody a little bit of

money to Outsource this process then

what you can do is go to Fiverr so

Fiverr is a Marketplace of Freelancers

looking to get jobs right so you can

simply search for book cover designs and

they're literally 46,000 different

people that's willing to do this for you

for various prices right so some will

charge you 50 bucks some even $15 so

it's as low as $5 $10 $20 uh to get your

book cover designed so for me I rather

pay somebody else a little bit of money

to save me a lot of time but if you want

to do this yourself you can definitely

do that within book bolt if you do want

to Outsource this process I leave a link

below this video to a few gigs that I've

personally worked with like this one

right here uh she will design a low

content book cover like these ones you

can see that it's really really good for

just $15 and this is the other gig who

will do it for $30 but he is also really

good so once you create your book

interior your book cover is made as well

then the next step is to actually go and

upload it to Amazon KDP so if you don't

have your Amazon KDP account all you

have to do is go to kp. amazon.com

create a new account make sure you enter

your bank account tax information the

basic stuff so you can get paid then

what you want to do is to click on this

create button and click on paperback and

just follow the prompts and enter your

book details now you will have to choose

your book price so I recommend you look

at your competitors and price your book

competitively and that is all you have

to do your book will be live within 72

hours so in my opinion this might be one

of the easiest ways to start making

money on Amazon KDP just because there's

so many people looking for these types

of books related to the upcoming holiday

right so if you go and Chase holidays

even if this is your very first book and

it's not that good as you saw earlier

like books with a two star average

rating is making hundreds of dollars a

day so you can see that you can still

make money now of course in the long

term you want to keep improving your

skills and actually make a good book

that gets four and five star reviews but

as a beginner this might be the best and

quickest way to start making money with

KDP and once again this is not just for

Easter right you can do it for every

single holiday just look up upcoming

holidays in Google and you will see a

ton of ideas and when 2025 comes you can

go through the list all over again and

of course you don't have to chase

seasonal topics like this you can do

Evergreen topics as well so you

definitely have a ton of books you can

make another thing I want to show you is

once your book is live to check sales

all you have to do is click on the

reports tab here and you can see if

you've made any sales here or not if you

guys want to grab book bolt I'll leave a

link below this video now they have two

different price point uh they have the

Newbie and the Pro Plan just to heads up

that the Pro Plan is what you want

because it comes with a puzzle creation

software uh so that you can go and

create these kind of books now if you

The easiest and most effective way to succeed with Amazon KDP in 2025 combines high-demand niche selection, quality publishing, smart marketing, and automation. By leveraging seasonal trends, outsourcing key tasks, and maximizing distribution, you can build a scalable, profitable KDP business.

### 1. **Focus on High-Demand Niches (Evergreen & Seasonal)**
   - Instead of focusing solely on low-competition keywords, target proven, high-demand topics where readers are actively spending money.
   - Seasonal books (e.g., holiday-themed activity books, journals, and puzzle books) can generate short-term sales spikes.
   - Evergreen books (self-help, children's books, stress relief, decluttering, etc.) provide steady, long-term income.
   - Use research tools like Book Bolt and Amazon BSR rankings to identify profitable book ideas.

### 2. **Publish as Many High-Quality Books as Possible**
   - Quality outweighs quantity, but publishing multiple books diversifies revenue.
   - AI can help generate content, but it should be improved and refined to stand out.
   - Track feedback and reviews to improve future books.
   - Bundling books into multi-book collections maximizes earnings with minimal extra effort.

### 3. **Leverage Seasonal Trends for Fast Sales**
   - Holiday-themed books (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, etc.) can earn hundreds per day in peak seasons.
   - Tools like Book Bolt allow for quick creation of activity books (word searches, Sudoku, journals).
   - Plan ahead by researching upcoming holidays and publishing books months in advance.
   - While seasonal books have sales spikes, publishing enough of them ensures steady income throughout the year.

### 4. **Master Marketing (Getting Reviews & Sales)**
   - Reviews are essential; aim for at least 10 within the first month and build up to 50+.
   - Amazon Ads provide a quick way to get sales, while TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts offer free viral marketing opportunities.
   - Viral content showcasing books (flip-throughs, ASMR-style videos) can generate massive sales spikes.
   - Social proof (high reviews and strong branding) helps books stand out in competitive niches.

### 5. **Build Authority & Expand Beyond Books**
   - Sticking to one niche establishes credibility and allows for audience growth.
   - Successful publishers evolve into full-fledged brands, offering courses, coaching, and physical products.
   - Books should be the foundation of a broader business strategy, not just a one-off income stream.

### 6. **Outsource Tasks to Scale Efficiently**
   - Hiring freelancers (Fiverr, Upwork) for book covers, formatting, and writing saves time and ensures professional quality.
   - Start with affordable outsourcing ($5-$20 per task) and reinvest profits into higher-quality services.
   - Automate where possible, freeing up time to focus on marketing and business growth.

### 7. **Maximize Distribution (Ebook, Paperback, Audiobook, Bundles)**
   - Sell books in every available format: Kindle, paperback, hardcover, and audiobook.
   - AI-generated audiobooks will soon make audiobook production free and accessible.
   - Bundling existing books into collections creates new products without extra work, increasing royalties per sale.

### 8. **Use Print-on-Demand for Low-Risk Publishing**
   - No inventory, storage, or shipping—Amazon handles everything.
   - Profits are earned per sale, making KDP a low-risk, high-reward business model.
   - Once a book is uploaded, it can generate passive income indefinitely.

By combining **seasonal book publishing for quick profits** with **evergreen high-quality books for long-term success**, **smart marketing**, and **automation**, you can create a sustainable, scalable KDP business that generates income year-round. Whether starting with low-content seasonal books or expanding into full-fledged publishing, the key is **strategic execution and continuous improvement**.
