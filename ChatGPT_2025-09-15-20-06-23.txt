How the Beats Align with Save the Cat

Blake Snyder’s fifteen-beat framework foregrounds character transformation; The Sandman maps these beats across seasons by juxtaposing Dream’s omnipotence with evolving empathy—each victory (reclaimed artifact or rescued soul) sparks a deeper ethical dilemma, while the B-story humans (Rose, Hob, Calliope, Orpheus) personify the theme that power must serve life’s fragility, culminating in Dream’s cataclysmic act of mercy that answers Death’s challenge from the Theme Stated beat.
