Based on the following, name all the aspects of a screenplay that are used to create a good story: How the Dan Harmon Story Circle Can Make Your Story Better

T he act of storytelling has always been with us. Anthropologist Joseph Campbell took stories from around the world and found they all shared the same basic structure. Campbell’s Hero’s Journey laid out each of the fundamental steps in this story structure. A few decades later, Dan Harmon took this same idea and created the Story Circle. In Dan Harmon’s Story Circle, there are 8 essential steps that can guide almost any story from Fade In to Fade Out. Let’s walk through each step with examples so you can apply this foolproof structure to your next great idea.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL STORY STRUCTURE
The universal language of storytelling

There are two universal languages. One is math...the other is story. Storytelling is built into the human experience. It's how we pass on our history, where we can learn how to live, and answer questions about "right" and "wrong." 

It doesn't take a PhD in English Lit to understand what makes a story good or bad. We all know what a story should do, even if we can't articulate it. Perhaps the most common storytelling element that "makes or breaks" a story is a story structure.

Our goal for today is to lay out one such narrative formula: the Dan Harmon Story Circle. Let's start with a quick definition.

STORY CIRCLE DEFINITION

What's Dan Harmon's Story Circle?

The Dan Harmon Story Circle is a story structure divided into eight distinct parts following a protagonist's journey. Also called "The Story Embryo" or "Plot Embryo," these 8 steps follow a character's pursuit of a goal outside of their normal world. Their inevitable return finds them changed, whether or not they achieved their goal.

8 STEPS IN THE DAN HARMON STORY CIRCLE:
You — A character is in a zone of comfort,
Need — But they want something.
Go — They enter an unfamiliar situation,
Search — Adapt to it,
Find — Get what they wanted, 
Take — Pay a heavy price for it, 
Return — Then return to their familiar situation, 
Change — Having changed.
Granted, the eight steps of the Story Circle above are extremely simplified. We will cover each of these in more depth but you should already have a general idea of how the Story Circle works. Here's a diagram that shows both the ordering and the shape of this structure.

The Dan Harmon Story Circle
Why is the Story Circle a circle? Why not a straight line from Step 1 to Step 8? The circle provides an intangible momentum to the story, almost like a rollercoaster.

A protagonist begins at the top must descend figuratively in the story and literally in the circle. At the bottom of the circle, they are at their literal and figurative "low point," and their rise to success in the end is likewise represented visually on the Story Circle. 

The first thing you'll notice about Harmon's circle is that it is completely relatable. The stories we tell all the time often (yet naturally) follow Dan Harmon’s Story Circle. Here's the legendary screenwriter himself describing the Story Circle and how it works in an episode of Rick and Morty.

The Dan Harmon Story Circle Explained
You. Need. Go. Search. Find. Take. Return. Change. Those are the eight steps to Dan Harmon’s Story Circle. Because narrative is how we make sense of the world around us. You could also think of the Story Circle as the CliffsNotes to Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. Blake Snyder's Save the Cat! is another three-act structure that follows a similar path.

Campbell's work was a big influence for George Lucas while he created the biggest film franchise of all time, Star Wars. You can also see echoes of Campbell's work in The Matrix, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings.

Now that we have a general idea of how the Story Circle works, let's dive into each of the eight steps in more detail. Along the way, we'll use Toy Story, Inception, and Star Wars: A New Hope as our case studies.

DAN HARMON STORY CIRCLE
Step One: You

The essence of the "You" step is to establish the protagonist of the story. It doesn't always need to be a single person. It could be a family or a team. This is our introduction to our main character(s), an opportunity to see them before the story truly begins. 

This is important in creating a compelling character arc. A huge part of storytelling is the "change" the protagonist makes during their journey. In this stage, we firmly establish their character arc so we can assess this change at the end. This is also the time to understand the context around the character — their world, its rules, and how they fit inside it.

If we look at our case studies, we can see what the "You" step looks like.

Toy Story — We meet Woody and see the joy he receives from being Andy's favorite toy.
Inception — We meet Cobb and are introduced to his work as a contractor stealing information from people's subconscious.
Star Wars — We meet Luke, stuck working on his uncle's farm, yearning to explore the outside world.
HARMON STORY CIRCLE
Step Two: Need 

Once we've been introduced to the protagonist and their world, the next step is to figure out what they "need." Something happens to our character that presents a problem or a question (in other words an inciting incident). This is when the story starts to take shape — if "You" is the who of the story, "Need" is the what. 

This is where we learn the main goal of the protagonist, the pursuit of which will guide the rest of the story.

Toy Story — With the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, Woody needs to figure out how to once again become Andy's favorite.
Inception — Cobb needs to decide whether to take Saito's assignment, which could allow him to return home to his kids.
Star Wars — As R2-D2 delivers Princess Leia's message, Obi-wan invites Luke to join him in delivering the Death Star plans.
PLOT EMBRYO
Step Three: Go

Needs drive us into action. The "Go" step marks the protagonist's first steps across the threshold in pursuit of the need. This is why you always hear "we need an active protagonist." If there is a "Need" but not a "Go," the story ends. When writing your own script, make your need so vital that it's impossible not to go.

Crossing this 3rd step is also when the protagonist enters the bottom half of the Story Circle. Leaving their normal world behind and officially entering the unknown.

Toy Story — After Woody knocks Buzz out through the window, the rest of the toys turn on him. Andy takes Woody to Pizza Planet.
Inception — Cobb sets out to assemble his team for Saito's assignment, including a new architect, forger and chemist.
Star Wars — When Luke returns home to find his aunt and uncle murdered, he leaves with Obi-wan on their quest to Alderaan.
STORY CIRCLE
Step Four: Search

Search is where things begin getting more complicated. Both concerning the story you are telling AND in terms of the process. The character can address the need by searching for an answer. Great stories don't always do this so literally. For Harmon's Story Circle, it works to keep it active and straightforward. 

In a big epic feature film drama or a novel, the "search" is going to require more than a physical search. That means it's a series of obstacles the hero must overcome. It's where the rubber meets the road regarding that need.

Toy Story — Woody finds Buzz but they get trapped at Sid's house where they endure imminent destruction.
Inception — Cobb's team is ambushed, Saito is shot, they have no choice but to proceed with the plan.
Star Wars — Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star while the Millenium Falcon gets caught in its tractor beam.
HARMON CIRCLE
Step Five: Find

Eureka! The hero has searched and searched, and now he's found the Need that sent them on this journey. But is the story over? Nope. Because in a good story, the hero doesn't find what he needs.

He might have found what he wanted, but it turns out he needs something else. Something bigger. This is where plot and character development often collide.

Toy Story — Woody plans their escape from Sid's house and bonds with Buzz over why it's so great to be a toy.
Inception — Cobb enlists his target, Fischer, to help break into his own subconscious but Robert is killed and sent to limbo.
Star Wars — While planning their escape from the Death Star, Luke and Han rescue Princess Leia from the detention block.
DAN HARMON'S STORY CIRCLE
Step Six: Take

Take whatever you found! And escape with it! Campbell might call this part of the story circle the magic flight. Even though the hero successfully acquires their Need, it comes at a price. Even after their initial success, the protagonist(s) suffer heavily losses.

Depending on the genre, these "losses" could be anything from a temporary setback to the death of a major character.

Toy Story — As Woody and Buzz attempt to make it back to the moving truck, RC's battery dies, leaving them stranded.
Inception — Cobb and Ariadne risk entering limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, Cobb finally lets go of his guilt over Mal's death.
Star Wars — During their escape from the Death Star, Obi-wan sacrifices himself so that they can get away.
STORY CIRCLE EXAMPLES
Step Seven: Return

The return stage is coming into the home stretch. The character has brought back into the normal realm whatever they found and took. Be it a magical item, a person, a lesson...and as a result of this they...change.

Toy Story — Woody and Buzz make return safely to Andy.
Inception — Cobb emerges from limbo with Saito and awake on the plane, their mission a success.
Star Wars — The Rebels launch an attack on the Death Star and Luke is able to destroy it.
HARMON STORY CIRCLE
Step Eight: Change

The change could be a personal one; it can be change to the world around them. In the instance of a movie or long story, it would be both.

Sometimes the change has opposite effects too. The world has changed for the better, but maybe the protagonist has changed for the worst. Playing with the change step can be interesting. 

Toy Story — Woody learns to co-exist with Buzz.
Inception — Cobb returns to his children having let go of his guilt.
Star Wars — Luke has evolved from farm boy to Rebel pilot.

STORY CIRCLE
Closing up the Story Circle

Change is what makes it a good story. Change is the key to any story. The 8 steps built into the Dan Harmon Story Circle are designed to facilitate that change.

What do we do when we tell stories? In a basic, primal way, we try to grasp the changes around us. The changes that we can't control. Why do people die? Why does the sun rise each day? 

Our stories are how we better understand the world around us. In a way, stories are how we help ourselves cope with change. Reminding ourselves over and again that change will happen, and life goes on.

Do the same with the following: What is Save the Cat — Blake Synder’s Beat Sheet Explained
Sam KenchJune 4, 2023
What is Save the Cat
Let’s define Save the Cat
For breakdowns and definitions of other writing and storytelling terminology, be sure to take a look at our ultimate guide to screenwriting vocabulary.
SAVE THE CAT DEFINITION
What is Save the Cat?
Save the Cat is a bestselling non-fiction book on the craft of screenwriting written by Blake Snyder. After Save the Catwas published in 2005, it quickly grew to be considered one of the definitive screenwriting books.
“Save the Cat” has now become shorthand for a conventional screenwriting structure that can be applied to many modern Hollywood films.
Save the Cat Screenwriting
Who is Blake Snyder?
Blake Snyder was a successful Hollywood screenwriter who sold several scripts, sometimes for amounts in the seven-figure range. Two feature films written by Snyder were produced and released. 
Snyder pulled from his experiences in the film industry when writing what he hoped would be the definitive guide to making it as a professional screenwriter.
￼

Blake Snyder on the Great Wall of China

Several sequels to Save the Cat were written, including Save the Cat Strikes Back and Save the Cat Writes for TV. Some of the sequels were written by Snyder as well, though others were written posthumously by his students after his sudden passing in 2009.
The advice within Save the Cat has been highly acclaimed but has also met with pushback from some critics. Detractors of the book point to its advice as leading to formulaic storytelling and criticize the book for encouraging writers to rely on writing that is familiar and successful rather than encouraging creativity and originality. 
Save the Cat Screenwriting
What does it mean to save the cat?
The title, Save the Cat, is a screenwriting term coined by Blake Snyder and refers to a particular plot device. The save the cat method involves having the protagonist do something admirable toward the start of the story in order to establish them as a likable person and get the audience on their side. Having the protagonist save a cat can be literal or figurative.
Here are some examples.


Save the Cat scene examples  •  What does save the cat mean

Including a "save the cat scene" near the start of your script can be a quick way to generate empathy for and an attachment to your main character. Some writers and film critics push back against this plot device for a handful of reasons such as this type of scene being considered manipulative or cliché. Some also push back against the notion that protagonists always need to be likable and/or admirable.
Save the Cat Story Structure
Other screenwriting takeaways
The titular plot device is far from the only piece of information found within the pages of Save the Cat. There are structure analyses of successful films, logline breakdowns and a formula for writing original loglines, and more.
Perhaps even more highly regarded than the titular Save the Cat plot device is the Save the Cat beat sheet.
The Save the Cat beat sheet quickly became one of the most popular models for screenplay structure. The 15 beats outlined in this three-act plot structure model were based on a tried and true structure that Snyder compiled by analyzing the structure of dozens of successful films and scripts.
In the video below, we break down the Interstellar screenplayusing the Save the Cat beat sheet.

For further analysis, we also broke down Parasite, co-written and directed by Bong Joon Ho into the same set of story beats.

The beat sheet was the structure model employed by Snyder's own screenplays which sold. And some readers of the book have even sold their own screenplays after putting the Save the Cat beat sheet to use, though your mileage may vary. Now, let's run through these beats one at a time.
Save the Cat Story Structure
The Save the Cat Story Beats
So, what are these sacred story beats? Snyder honed his fifteen beats down to a science, even indicating the exact page they should happen on. Of course, these are merely suggestions and every story is different. But it does provide a clear guide to start with.
1. Opening Image — Page 1
This is a bit self explanatory. Snyder states the opening image (first scene) of your film is important because it establishes the world, the tone, the characters. Pretty much every screenplay follows this rule, whether or not they’re following the Save the Cat structure.
Check out Parasite’s opening image on page 1 of its screenplay, which we imported into StudioBinder’s screenwriting software:
Parasite screenplay  •  Read the script
The opening image here speaks volumes, as Snyder suggests it should. This is a struggling tight-knit family who are surviving in modern society by any means necessary. Read the entire Parasite screenplay along with additional analysis.
2. Theme Stated — Page 5
Most good films have some sort of theme. Sometimes films will have multiple running themes. But the main theme, according to Snyder, should be stated on page five.
For example, say the theme of your movie is the power of community, and your protagonist learns this lesson over the course of the runtime. So on page five, you may have a protagonist’s coworker say, “Devon, why is it you never accept any help?” Theme stated. 
Here's a breakdown of how theme works in film, including Parasite.


How Theme Works in Film

3. Set-Up — Pages 1-10
Your first ten pages are crucial. Using Save the Cat, you should establish the look and feel of the film, as well as the majority of the principal characters.
It’s also the time when you establishes your protagonist’s baseline – what’s their life look like before it’s turned upside-down?
4. Catalyst — Page 12
Speaking of turning your protagonist’s life upside down – this is the big one, also referred to by screenwriting scholars as the inciting incident.
Your character may initially reject the catalyst’s importance, but by the end of act one, it will have sent them on a whole new trajectory.
5. Debate — Pages 12-25
After the catalyst, your protagonist isn’t sure whether or not they should act.
Say the catalyst is when someone visits the protagonist telling them they’re their child from the future, and the protagonist needs to find a scientist in Antarctica to save the world. The pages after should be the protagonist wrestling with this information. That wasn’t really their future child, right? Why do they have to save the world?
6. Break into Two — Page 25
This is the decision the main character makes that sets the story officially in motion. Sticking with our previous example, the protagonist gets on a boat headed to Antarctica. Now we’re in Act II.
7. B Story — Page 30
The main story is underway, so it’s time to kickstart the subplot(s). Maybe as the protagonist searches for the scientist in the Antarctic, he meets a man who will end up being his future husband.
8. Fun and Games — Page 30-55
This is one of the most amorphous of Snyder’s beats. Now that your protagonist has entered their new world or discovered their new power, spend time with them as they explore.


In Harry Potter, lots of time is spent establishing Harry’s new world

What are the rules of the world? What’s different? What’s the same?
9. Midpoint — Page 55
The midpoint can take many forms. The protagonist may have a false victory- they think they’ve won, when in reality there’s a lot more trouble left. 
Or perhaps they suffer a massive setback– they lose a friend, have a crisis of faith, etc. The nature of the midpoint is up to you. All that matters is that it’s a big moment. Here's a further breakdown of how midpoints work.
Take the iconic final shot of :


The Importance of Midpoints Explained

10. Bad Guys Close In — Pages 55 - 75
This doesn’t have to be literal, though it can be. Essentially, this is the part of the screenplay where everything gets more difficult. Let’s go back to our Antarctica story. 
At the midpoint, the protagonist locates the scientist, but in this section, it proves to be a false victory. The scientist has no idea what the protagonist is talking about, and thinks he’s crazy. In these pages, the protagonist now has to try and figure out what his future child was talking about on his own.
11. All is Lost — Page 75
The nadir. Nothing is going right for your protagonist. 
We’re really punishing our character with this plot beat. Maybe they lose their mentor. Maybe they’re overwhelmed by self-doubt.
12. Dark Night of the Soul — Pages 75-85
In these pages, your protagonist is reacting to the All Is Lost plot point. This is about as bummed as they’re going to be. They’re close to giving up. Maybe they have given up.
13. Break into Three — Page 85
We’re entering the final act. The break into three is the last gasp – your protagonist essentially says, “Screw it. Let’s do it.” This may be prompted by a strike of luck, or just a renewed sense of purpose. 
Whatever it is, this is the beat that tells us our character is down but not out.
14. Finale — Pages 85-110
This is the grand hurrah, otherwise referred to as the climax(or anticlimax). This is where everything your protagonist has learned along the way (plus what she’s had in her all along) comes together in a big showdown. This may be with an antagonist or perhaps with their own inner demons. 
It all depends on the story you’re telling.
But no matter what, this is the culmination. So tie up your loose ends and give a finale that makes the first two acts worth it.
15. Final Image — Page 110
It’s all over. Time to leave your audience with a lasting visual, something which sums up your story and perhaps speaks to your opening image. 
Take the iconic final shot of The Graduate.


Final image of The Graduate

Our main characters have what they want, but now they’re facing down their uncertain futures. Now what?
It’s the perfect ending to the film, completing the story arc while also hammering home the theme of young adult aimlessness.
Snyder’s 15 beats aren’t for everyone, and they certainly aren’t a requirement for a good screenplay. But abiding by the Save the Cat rules doesn’t mean your screenplay is unoriginal or predictable, either. It all depends on the story you want to tell.

Below is a synthesized vocabulary that merges the key elements from Dan Harmon's Story Circle and Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat beat sheet. Each step from one methodology is mapped to its closest counterpart(s) in the other, creating a unified narrative structure:

1. SETUP / ESTABLISHMENT
   - This stage introduces the protagonist in their normal world, setting the tone and context.
   - Dan Harmon’s "You" (introducing the character and their familiar environment)
   - Save the Cat’s "Opening Image", "Theme Stated", and "Set-Up" (establishing the world, mood, and initial character conditions)

2. INCITING DESIRE / NEED
   - Here the protagonist’s internal or external need is revealed—a problem, desire, or disruption that propels the story.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Need" (the moment a desire or problem emerges)
   - Save the Cat’s "Catalyst" (the inciting incident that shakes the status quo) followed by the "Debate" (the protagonist’s initial hesitation and wrestling with the new need)

3. THRESHOLD CROSSING / COMMITMENT
   - The protagonist makes a decisive move, leaving their comfort zone to pursue the goal.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Go" (the decision to step into an unfamiliar situation)
   - Save the Cat’s "Break into Two" (the point where the journey into the new world begins)

4. EXPLORATION & CONFRONTATION
   - In this phase the protagonist navigates the new environment, meets allies and obstacles, and explores the promise of the new situation.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Search" (the active pursuit in the unfamiliar world)
   - Save the Cat’s "B Story" (the introduction of subplots that often support the main narrative) and "Fun and Games" (the exploration of the new world and its inherent challenges and opportunities)

5. TURNING POINT / DISCOVERY
   - A pivotal moment occurs where the protagonist makes a breakthrough—either a moment of apparent success or a realization that changes the game.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Find" (the moment when the protagonist discovers what they were seeking, even if it is not the final answer)
   - Save the Cat’s "Midpoint" (a significant turning point that often marks a false victory or major insight)

6. CONFRONTATION & CONSEQUENCE
   - The protagonist now faces the cost of their discovery, encountering intensified opposition or personal sacrifice.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Take" (the phase where the acquisition comes at a heavy price)
   - Save the Cat’s "Bad Guys Close In", "All is Lost", and "Dark Night of the Soul" (sequences where escalating challenges and internal crises force the character to confront their vulnerabilities)

7. RETURN & RESOLUTION
   - The journey begins to wind down as the protagonist returns toward the familiar world, now armed with new insights or abilities.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Return" (the movement back toward the original world, albeit changed)
   - Save the Cat’s "Break into Three" (the final push into Act III) and "Finale" (the climax where conflicts are resolved)

8. TRANSFORMATION / CHANGE
   - The narrative concludes with a fundamental transformation of the protagonist, reflecting the growth experienced throughout the journey.
   - Dan Harmon’s "Change" (the lasting impact of the journey on the character)
   - Save the Cat’s "Final Image" (a closing visual or moment that echoes the transformation and contrasts with the Opening Image)

This unified structure underscores common storytelling principles:
• A clear beginning that establishes the character and world.
• A disruptive inciting need that forces the character into action.
• A decisive crossing into a new realm, leading to exploration, confrontation, and discovery.
• Rising stakes that culminate in a confrontation of consequences.
• A return that resolves the narrative while showcasing profound transformation.

By broadening the definitions where needed, these two methodologies align into a comprehensive guide for crafting compelling, well-structured stories.

9. **Escalating Consequences** – Opposition intensifies. Stakes rise. External forces and internal doubts push the protagonist toward their breaking point.

10. **Breaking Point** – Everything crumbles. The protagonist experiences a devastating loss, betrayal, or failure that forces total despair.

11. **Reckoning & Resolve** – In the darkness, they reflect, adapt, and find new determination. A lesson is learned or a truth is embraced.

12. **Final Trial** – The protagonist makes their ultimate push. They face their greatest challenge, where everything is on the line.

13. **Transformation & Triumph** – Whether through victory or failure, the protagonist is fundamentally changed. They act based on their growth.

14. **Return to the World** – The protagonist comes full circle, re-entering their old world—but as a changed person.

15. **Echo of Change** – A final moment or image that contrasts with the beginning, showing how far the protagonist has come.
