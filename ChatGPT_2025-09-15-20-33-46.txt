Below is a general step-by-step guide for installing Nexus Mods for Days Gone on Steam. The exact steps may vary depending on the specific mod, so always check the mod’s page for instructions. But if you’re missing something, this walkthrough should help you cover the basics:

1) CREATE A NEXUS MODS ACCOUNT (IF YOU HAVEN’T ALREADY)
   • Go to nexusmods.com and create a free account (or log in if you already have one).

2) INSTALL A MOD MANAGER (OPTIONAL, BUT RECOMMENDED)
   • You can either use Nexus’s own Vortex Mod Manager or another mod manager. Vortex automates the download and placement of mod files.
   • If you prefer manual installation, you can skip a mod manager and proceed with manual steps.

3) LOCATE YOUR DAYS GONE INSTALLATION FOLDER
   • By default, for Steam installations, it’s something like:
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Days Gone
   • Inside the Days Gone folder, you’ll see subfolders (such as “BendGame”, “Engine”, etc.).

4) DOWNLOAD THE MOD YOU WANT
   • On Nexus Mods, go to the Days Gone section and find the mod you want.
   • Press “Manual Download” or use “Mod Manager Download” if you’re using Vortex.
   • Always read the mod description for any special installation steps.

5) EXTRACT THE MOD FILES (FOR MANUAL INSTALLATION)
   • If you downloaded a .zip or .rar archive, extract it.
   • You’ll usually end up with one or more .pak files (or other files depending on the mod).

6) IDENTIFY THE CORRECT FOLDER FOR THE MOD FILES
   • Many Days Gone mods require you to place .pak files in:
     Days Gone\BendGame\Content\sfpaks
   • Some might instruct you to go to:
     Days Gone\BendGame\Content\Paks
     (Mod authors typically specify which folder to use.)
   • Occasionally, you must rename or overwrite existing .pak files. If so, back up the original files before overwriting.

7) INSTALL USING A MOD MANAGER (IF YOU CHOSE VORTEX OR SIMILAR)
   • In Vortex, for example, you’d click “Install from File” or let it handle the download and put files in the right place.
   • Enable or deploy the mod once installed.

8) VERIFY THE MOD IS ACTIVE
   • Launch the game to check if the mod’s changes are working.
   • If you don’t see the changes, re-check that you placed the files in the correct folder or that your mod manager is set up properly.

9) TROUBLESHOOT COMMON PROBLEMS
   • Make sure you have the latest version of Days Gone and the mod (some mods break after game updates).
   • If the mod overwrites important files, always keep backups in case you need to restore them.
   • Check mod comments or posts on Nexus Mods if you run into issues. Often, someone else has already asked the same question.

That’s the general process. The most common slip-ups are placing files in the wrong folder or forgetting to rename or overwrite a .pak file when required. If your mod’s documentation contradicts any of the above steps, follow the modder’s instructions first. Good luck, and enjoy Days Gone with your new mods!
