Using OCR, produce a tablature sheet for the entire song “Love You Madly” by Cake based on the attached image.

ChatGPT:


The OCR output from the provided image is highly fragmented and does not contain clear tablature text. This may be due to the image resolution, quality, or the complexity of the formatting in the tablature sheet.

For the most accurate transcription of this specific song, I recommend accessing a dedicated tablature site, such as Ultimate Guitar or Songsterr, and downloading a properly formatted version directly from their databases. Alternatively, providing a higher-resolution image might help improve OCR results.

The OCR extraction from this image returned no readable text. This could be due to the resolution, font style, or the layout of the tablature, which OCR tools often struggle to interpret accurately.

For precise and reliable tablature, I recommend accessing websites like Ultimate Guitar or Songsterr, where the song "Love You Madly" by Cake is likely available in proper format. Alternatively, providing a higher-resolution scan or a PDF version may help improve text recognition.
