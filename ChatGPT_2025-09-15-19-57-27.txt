Explain like I'm in 8th grade: what makes a good plot twist (based on the following):
Second Wind
[Intro Music]
I'm a sucker for plot twists. A really good plot 
twist is the third point on the triangle where  
the other two points are the really good joke 
and the really good jump scare. In all three  
cases we're taken by surprise to pleasant effect 
that enhances the story, and in all three cases,  
that effect is completely lost if we in any 
way see it coming. Especially jump scares. A  
good surprise jump scare gives me a shot of 
adrenaline and a sense of "Ooh, you got me,  
well played." But if I know a jump scare is 
coming, I just feel really anxious and miserable.  
That's why I never got on with Five Nights at 
Freddy's. I suspect it might be lingering trauma  
from a childhood incident involving a beloved 
helium balloon and an unexpected stucco ceiling.
Maybe this is biased of me to say but I think 
plot twists in video games are all the more  
interesting because of the interactive element. 
We're a participant as well as an observer,  
all our decisions have been made under 
false information, the blood of all those  
poor bastards in Spec Ops The Line is on our 
hands too. Oh yeah, I should probably drop a  
general spoiler warning before I talk about any 
more specifics. Hey viewers! Yes, including you,  
the person who's not really listening because 
they put this on in the background while they  
water their crops in Stardew Valley - I'm going 
to spoil some video game plot twists in a bit.  
I'll make sure to clearly state the name of 
the game before I spoil it, but you've gotta  
pay attention for that to work. Meet me half way 
here, I promise your cauliflowers will be fine.
So to talk about what separates a good twist 
from a bad twist, let's go straight to the top:  
my favourite plot twist in all of gaming. It's 
in Second Sight, an old PS2 game by developers  
Free Radical, best known for the Timesplitters 
series. In Second Sight, we open with the old  
chestnut of our dude waking up with amnesia and 
psychic powers, and over the course of being on  
the run from some evil corporation or other 
we gradually learn what happened in numerous  
flashbacks of a military operation gone wrong. 
But something's off. Reality keeps changing.  
We'll learn that character X is dead, then after 
the next flashback, character X is suddenly alive  
again. At the end there's a moment when it 
seems all is lost and we are doomed to die,  
until the twist reveals the truth: what we 
thought were flashbacks were in fact the events  
of the present day, and what we thought was the 
present was a psychic prediction of the future.  
And so the day is saved as we can now prevent the 
plot's inciting incident before it even occurs.
Certainly didn't see that coming, and yet, it 
doesn't feel unearned or like it came out of  
nowhere. Hell, in retrospect it's given away by 
the fucking title. What about a bad twist? Plenty  
to choose from, but most recently I've been 
replaying Beyond Good & Evil, and that's got a  
classic bad twist ending. At the final boss, main 
character Jade is informed that she's actually a  
super special alien baby birthed or created in 
some unspecific way from the Lovecraftian being  
that is the hitherto unmentioned big baddie. 
This is a bad twist because it neither changes  
anything, nor explains anything. Until the very 
final chapter Jade never demonstrates any alien  
characteristic or skills beyond being able to 
smack things with a stick very hard, and she's  
never shown much interest in her own origins. She 
has been highly motivated to stop the actions of  
the villains this whole time, so there's no 
sense she might be tempted to switch sides.
See, my two main criteria for a good plot 
twist are firstly that I mustn't see it coming,  
and secondly that it can't come out of nowhere, 
either. It has to be something the rest of the  
plot has been building up to, a final puzzle piece 
that puts everything that's already happened in a  
new light. See, a really good twist means you 
get two stories for the price of one. 'Cos  
you can replay it and see how knowing the twist 
recontextualises everything that came before it.
One of my favourite games with a 
plot-recontextualising twist is of course  
Silent Hill 2. Hopefully if you've followed me for 
a while you've already played that game and know  
the story, and if not hopefully I can ruin it for 
you before Bloober Team does. In Silent Hill 2,  
we play James Sunderland, who comes to the titular 
haunted town after receiving a letter from his  
long dead wife, and descends into a tortuous 
odyssey through a surreal hellscape of violence  
and despair which on first playthrough might not 
seem like it has any meaning behind it besides  
the standard horror setup of "clueless everyman 
gets victimised for going somewhere he shouldn't."
But then you get to the twist, in which its 
finally revealed that James' wife Mary isn't  
long dead but rather quite recently dead, and 
he killed her. Before having a psychotic break  
and stumbling to Silent Hill. And after that 
you can replay the game and realise that all  
the horror he's gone through has been his own 
subconscious mind screaming at him to remember  
what he did. That's why he's been seeing very 
distinctly feminine monsters being victimised  
all over the place by a big burly dude with 
a huge, thrusting weapon between his legs.
And I bring this up because the whole 
topic of plot twists in games came to  
mind while I was writing about Sanabi 
for my Fully Ramblomatic yearly roundup  
video. Sanabi is a nice little pixel art 
platformer with an in-depth plot about a  
man who loses his daughter in a terrorist 
bombing and goes on a revenge rampage,  
in the process teaming up with a cheerful teenage 
girl in what felt like a pretty straight ripoff  
of the whole Last of Us dynamic. But the 
interesting entire-plot-recontextualising  
twist of Sanabi is that it turns out the girl 
we've been escorting IS our daughter, and our  
memory of her death was false. Furthermore, we're 
actually a kill robot implanted with the memories  
of a dead soldier that have been tweaked 
a bit to make us a more effective killer.
It was unexpected and somewhat foreshadowed by 
various events in the plot, but at the same time,  
it left a bad taste in my mouth. It felt cheap, 
somehow. And I wondered why. Specifically,  
why the false memory twist in Silent Hill 2 works 
for me, but not this one. On reflection, what it  
comes down to is that there's a difference between 
"unreliable narrator" and "the plot flat out lies  
to the audience." See, Sanabi's protagonist's 
false memories are shown to us as full on  
cutscenes. We literally see his daughter die in 
a bombing attack and the fictional events leading  
to his revenge rampage, and we have no reason to 
doubt them, because of the unspoken understanding  
in a third person game that we view things 
from the perspective of an omniscient overseer.
The equivalent would be if Silent Hill 2 opened 
with a cutscene flat out showing Mary dying of  
natural causes in front of James with a great 
big calendar on the wall declaring it to be  
three years ago. That doesn't happen. What happens 
is, the story about Mary dying three years ago is  
something we only ever hear from James' mouth, in 
his opening monologue. It's James rather than the  
game as a whole that is lying to us, or more 
accurately, himself. At first we've no reason  
not to take his word for it, but over the course 
of the game there are many hints to the fact that  
James is a little bit off, mentally. He's confused 
about certain details, he's weirdly fixated,  
he sticks his hand right down a toilet at one 
point without a moment's hesitation. And it's  
all those moments that are paid off when the 
full extent of his self-delusion is revealed.
Lying to the audience like in Sanabi and that 
one bit in Heavy Rain where we learn after the  
fact that a character we were controlling 
murdered someone during the time we were  
controlling them and the game deliberately 
didn't show us, smacks of a writer trying to  
make their twist impossible to predict, because 
it feels to them like some kind of victory over  
the audience. There's a word for authors who 
do that: "dickweeds." Who cares if someone  
might predict your precious twist? Speculating 
is half the fun. Let them have their moment of  
glory. Don't put your own ego above the value 
of the experience you're trying to create.
So that's three rules for a good twist: must 
be unexpected, must recontextualize the plot,  
and no lying to the audience. But there's 
got to be even more nuance to this,  
because thinking about it, all of these 
criteria are also met by the twist at the  
end of 12 Minutes. It's undeniably effective, 
I just doubt that the intended effect was to  
make me hate the game's guts. Guess we'll have to 
tack on one more rule. Rule 4: no incest babies.

i. A good plot twist surprises you.
    - Like a good joke or a jump scare, the best twists catch you off guard in a fun way.
    - If you can see it coming, it ruins the feeling.

ii. A good plot twist makes you look at everything differently.
    - It changes how you understand the story so far.
    - When you replay the story, the twist makes earlier parts mean something new.

iii. A good plot twist plays fair with the audience.
    - The story shouldn't lie to you. It can trick you, but not by showing you things that aren’t true.
    - If a character is lying or confused (like in *Silent Hill 2*), that's okay. But the game or story itself shouldn’t cheat.

iv. A good plot twist fits into the story.
    - It shouldn’t feel random or added just to shock you.
    - It should connect to what the characters care about and what’s already happened.

v. A good plot twist respects the player or viewer.
    - It doesn’t treat the audience like fools or try to “beat” them.
    - Guessing a twist isn’t bad—it means the story makes sense.

vi. A bad twist:
    - Comes out of nowhere with no setup (like *Beyond Good & Evil*).
    - Lies to the audience using fake scenes (like *Sanabi* or *Heavy Rain*).
    - Adds something that doesn’t matter or changes nothing.
    - Might even be disturbing for no good reason (like *12 Minutes*).

vii. In short: a good twist is fair, surprising, meaningful, and honest—even if it hides the truth until the right time.
