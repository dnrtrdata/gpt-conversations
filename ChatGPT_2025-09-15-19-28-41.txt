Blubber – Character Guide (Permanent & Optional)

This document gathers all character information relevant to the intended *Blubber* screenplay.  It distinguishes between characters who are **permanent fixtures** in the narrative and those retained as **optional possibilities**.  Permanent characters may have aspects of their personalities refined in later development, but their existence in the story is not up for debate.  Optional characters are kept in reserve to solve future narrative or thematic problems and may be integrated or omitted as needed.

## Permanent Characters

### Maia Kahananui – Protagonist and emerging leader

Maia is a 17‑year‑old high‑school student of mixed Hawaiian and Caucasian heritage.  She works part‑time as a parks‑and‑recreation aide and once served as a lifeguard.  Meticulous and disciplined, she keeps her world under control through strict routines and excels in swimming, rescue and marine science.  Maia’s core motivation is to protect her loved ones and Maui’s environment while proving that order and preparedness can avert tragedy.  Deep down she fears abandonment and the unpredictable power of the ocean.  Her rigidity and difficulty trusting others often put her at odds with her community.  Over the course of the story she evolves from hiding behind routines to accepting leadership, learning to trust her friends and combining scientific and spiritual knowledge to confront the Blenders.

### Noah Reyes – Loyal friend and moral support

Noah is a teenage peer who works with Maia and shares her classes.  Quiet, compassionate and humorous, he becomes her emotional anchor.  While others panic, Noah remains calm and encourages Maia to balance duty and self‑care.  His arc deepens as he moves from supportive bystander to active participant; he risks his life to save Maia, proving his bravery and strengthening their bond.

### Maureen Kahananui – Estranged mother and marine biologist

Maureen is a marine biologist in her early forties and the estranged wife of Derek.  Once brilliant and obsessive, she left her family to pursue research on marine anomalies.  By the time she returns she has become a sunburned, nomadic beach‑bum drifting under the fog of a sincere, depression‑driven belief that she abandoned her husband and daughter for the greater good.  She tells herself they are better off without her, even though her absence has deeply wounded Maia.  This misguided conviction, combined with physical and mental deterioration, causes erratic behavior.  Maureen’s return forces Maia to confront her own resentments and fears, and the uneasy reconciliation between mother and daughter underscores the dangers of obsession and the cost of familial neglect.

### Derek Kahananui – Father and reluctant caretaker

Derek is Maia’s middle‑aged father.  Initially withdrawn and guilt‑ridden over Maureen’s departure, he downplays the community’s concerns and avoids conflict.  His passivity and denial leave Maia to shoulder responsibilities and strain his relationship with his brother James.  When the crisis escalates and James sacrifices himself, Derek begins to accept responsibility.  He rallies the group, supports Maia and quietly thanks her in the aftermath, marking the start of his redemption arc.  Derek’s journey from avoidance to action highlights the importance of choosing family over complacency.

### Leilani Iona (formerly Kai Iona) – Mentee and resourceful survivor

Leilani (a tentative new first name chosen to better suggest femininity) is a twelve‑year‑old girl of mixed British and Filipino ancestry.  She acts as a spiritual and cultural anchor, practising traditional chants and protective rituals taught by her grandmother.  However, she also lives in poverty and sometimes engages in petty theft or manipulation to help her family survive.  Like an *Oliver Twist* or *Aladdin* figure, she will bend rules without directly harming others, and her awareness of how her actions affect people occasionally causes unintended problems.  Leilani must remain sympathetic; her moral compromises cannot be so extreme that the audience stops rooting for her.  Her motivations centre on honouring her heritage, preserving her community and protecting her loved ones.  Over time she learns to balance survival instincts with compassion and uses her spiritual knowledge to help combat the Blenders.

### Nalani Chen – Resort operations manager and community liaison

Nalani is the Chinese‑Hawaiian manager of a major resort on Maui and acts as a bridge between corporate interests and the local community.  Publicly she is pragmatic, earnest and focused on maintaining tourism revenue and the island’s reputation.  She appears supportive of Maia’s efforts and advocates for community safety, which builds trust with Maia and the audience.  However, her priority is balancing economics and safety; it is only during the story’s darkest moments that the conflicting sides of her loyalty are revealed.  Like the mayor in *Jaws*, Nalani must decide between saving lives and preserving the island’s economy.  Whether she seeks redemption or succumbs to guilt will shape her final moments.

### James Kahananui – Uncle and mentor

James is Derek’s older brother and a surrogate father to Maia.  Strong, pragmatic and caring, he criticises Derek’s inaction and pushes Maia to embrace leadership.  He serves as the group’s conscience and strategic mind.  During the crisis he sacrifices himself by distracting the alpha Blender, buying time for the others to escape.  His death galvanises Maia and Derek and underscores the story’s themes of selflessness and family.

### The Blenders – Hive‑minded invasive species

The Blenders are the non‑human antagonists, and their existence is permanent even if specific behaviours or mechanics may evolve.  See the following section for detailed descriptions.

## The Blenders – Diegetic and Academic View

### Diegetic (Character Perspective)

From the viewpoint of those living on Maui, the Blenders are terrifying unknowns.  They erupt from the ocean as serpentine tubes lined with rotating layers of gnashing teeth, shredding anything in their path.  Their voracious appetite for fat makes them target whales, seals and eventually humans, and each feeding causes them to swell in size.  In the water they move with ruthless speed, but on land they are awkward and slow, creating scenes of tension as people attempt to evade their relentless advance.  The creatures seem to communicate and coordinate like a hive; larger individuals make decisions and direct the swarm.  Witnesses talk of their uncanny intelligence and adaptability, noting how they learn from failed attacks and exploit weaknesses.  Rumours spread that the monsters consume their own kind when food is scarce, a horrifying glimpse into their brutal social order.  To the characters, the Blenders are a manifestation of the ocean’s anger and an existential threat to their home.

### Academic (Precise Description and Symbolism)

Scientifically, Blenders are invasive marine predators whose physiology and behaviour reflect a perfect adaptation for consumption.  Their bodies are tube‑shaped and propelled by concentric layers of rotating jaws that both shred prey and drive locomotion through water.  They begin life as purely aquatic hunters but rapidly develop limited land capabilities as the story progresses, illustrating their capacity for adaptation.  The species exhibits a hierarchical structure based on size: individuals grow dramatically as they ingest blubber and fat, and the largest member of a cluster exerts hive‑mind control over the others.  In times of scarcity they resort to cannibalism, further accelerating the growth of the dominant individual.  Blenders on land move slowly and awkwardly, relying on slow‑burn tension rather than sudden strikes, but remain deadly due to their mass and determination.  Beyond their biology, the creatures symbolise themes of unchecked consumption, environmental imbalance and social hierarchy.  Their relentless feeding reflects greed at both ecological and economic levels; their evolution from ocean‑bound to land‑capable mirrors how invasive species can breach boundaries; and their cannibalistic hierarchy comments on human social systems that reward size and appetite.  They are the “monster in the house” whose clear rules (fat seeking, size‑based growth) create horror while providing a framework for the narrative’s critique of consumption and exploitation.

## Optional Characters (Multiple‑Choice Pool)

The following characters come from earlier drafts, theoretical exercises or ensemble lists.  They may be drawn upon to address narrative or thematic needs but are not guaranteed a place in the final story.

* **Julia Morita** – A local city council member prioritising economic interests, charismatic and persuasive but dismissive of environmental concerns.  She could represent political resistance to change.
* **Kalea Tomlinson** – A freelance marine biologist with deep knowledge of ocean life, adaptable but sceptical of teamwork.  She could provide scientific insight and challenge Maia’s methods.
* **Edward “Eddie” Masaki** – A retired Coast Guard captain or fun‑loving entrepreneur who pursues adventure and brings humour.  His reckless attitude could create tension and illustrate the dangers of underestimating the Blenders.
* **Emily Santos** – A community organiser with strong leadership qualities.  She might clash with Maia over control but ultimately aid in rallying townspeople.
* **Dr. Helena Ito** – A visiting marine ecologist whose pragmatism and detachment contrast with local sentiment.  She could offer scientific solutions while learning to value community.
* **Gabriel Reyes** – A fisherman or caretaker motivated by altruism.  His willingness to sacrifice himself could mirror James’s arc and explore themes of self‑care and martyrdom.
* **Russell Anderson** – A wealthy tourist who provides comic relief through his obliviousness to danger.  He embodies outsider ignorance and could serve as a cautionary figure.
* **Ben and Kaipo** – Early prototypes of protagonists from a previous outline: Ben is an everyday jogger and reluctant hero, Kaipo is spiritually attuned and senses danger in the ocean.  Their traits have been folded into Maia and Leilani but could be resurrected as separate characters if needed.
* **Lily, Marcy, Bianca and Greg** – Minor characters from early scene lists.  Lily hands out conservation flyers; Marcy and Bianca are potential victims; Greg is Bianca’s father.  They illustrate the community’s varied responses.
* **Dr. Ethan Takahashi** – A scientist who appears briefly in older drafts.  He could be repurposed to deliver exposition or scientific equipment.
* **Officer Gregson** – A law‑enforcement figure representing the town’s official response.
* **Fishermen, tourists and townspeople** – Groups mentioned in early drafts.  They form the backdrop of Maui’s community and illustrate the social and economic stakes.

The presence of these optional characters is flexible; they can be combined, altered or omitted as the story’s development demands.

Blubber – Character Guide (Permanent & Optional)

In this document, I’m laying out all the character information that is essential for the Blubber screenplay. I’m dividing them into two categories: permanent characters, who are locked into the narrative and cannot be cut, and optional characters, who I keep in reserve to solve narrative or thematic needs as development progresses. The permanent characters may evolve in personality or detail, but their place in the story is guaranteed. The optional ones give me flexibility to adjust the ensemble depending on pacing, tone, and structure.

Permanent Characters

Maia Kahananui – Protagonist and emerging leader
Maia is the center of the story. She’s 17, mixed Hawaiian and Caucasian, and she’s defined by her meticulous, disciplined approach to life. She works part-time in parks and recreation, has lifeguarding experience, and excels in swimming and marine science. What drives her is protecting her loved ones and Maui’s fragile environment, while proving that order and preparedness can keep tragedy at bay. Underneath, she fears abandonment and the uncontrollable force of the ocean. Because of her rigidity, she often clashes with others in her community. Her arc is crucial: she moves from hiding behind routines to embracing leadership, opening herself to trust, and blending science with cultural and spiritual knowledge to face the Blenders. She’s the spine of the story, and her growth embodies the theme of resilience in the face of chaos.

Noah Reyes – Loyal friend and moral support
Noah is Maia’s classmate and co-worker. He’s quiet, funny, compassionate, and he acts as her emotional anchor. When others panic, Noah steadies the group and encourages Maia to balance duty with self-care. His arc is about moving from background support to active participant. At a critical point, he risks his life for Maia, and that moment of bravery strengthens their bond and proves his worth as more than comic relief or sidekick. He grounds Maia and humanizes her struggle.

Maureen Kahananui – Estranged mother and marine biologist
Maureen is in her early forties. She’s Maia’s estranged mother and Derek’s ex-wife. Once a brilliant marine biologist, she abandoned her family to chase marine anomalies. By the time she returns, she’s sunburned, half-drifter, and weighed down by the conviction that leaving her family was for the greater good. She believes Maia and Derek are better off without her, even though her absence cut Maia deeply. Her return brings raw emotional conflict, because Maia is forced to confront resentment and grief. Maureen’s arc is about obsession and regret, and whether reconciliation is possible when damage runs deep. She gives me the opportunity to dramatize the cost of chasing knowledge at the expense of family.

Derek Kahananui – Father and reluctant caretaker
Derek is Maia’s father, middle-aged, guilt-ridden, and stuck in denial. He avoids conflict, downplays community fears, and lets responsibilities fall on Maia. His passivity has alienated his brother James and put strain on his family. But when the crisis escalates, and James sacrifices himself, Derek is forced to face his failures. He rallies the group, supports Maia, and in the end quietly thanks her, marking the start of his redemption. Derek’s arc illustrates the importance of action over avoidance and choosing family over complacency.

Leilani Iona – Mentee and resourceful survivor
Leilani is twelve, mixed British and Filipino. She serves as Maia’s mentee, a girl who blends spiritual tradition with the survival instincts of someone living in poverty. She chants and practices protective rituals from her grandmother, but she also steals or manipulates when necessary to help her family. She’s a scrappy survivor in the Oliver Twist or Aladdin tradition, bending rules without cruelty. I need her to remain sympathetic; her compromises can’t push the audience away. Her arc is about learning to balance survival with compassion, and her knowledge of chants and rituals gives me a cultural and spiritual weapon against the Blenders. She’s young, but she becomes one of the bravest survivors.

Nalani Chen – Resort operations manager and community liaison
Nalani is the Chinese-Hawaiian resort manager who sits between corporate tourism and the local community. She wants safety, but her first responsibility is protecting revenue and reputation. She builds trust with Maia by appearing supportive, but her true conflict is the Jaws mayor dilemma: lives versus economy. When things get darkest, her loyalties are tested. She either finds redemption or falls into guilt, and her arc dramatizes the pressure of leadership when corporate priorities collide with human survival.

James Kahananui – Uncle and mentor
James is Derek’s older brother and Maia’s surrogate father. He’s pragmatic, strong, and bluntly critical of Derek. He pushes Maia to step into leadership and serves as the group’s conscience. His sacrifice—distracting the alpha Blender to let others escape—cements the theme of family and selflessness. James’s death galvanizes Maia and Derek. He’s the anchor figure whose absence leaves a hole that forces others to grow.

The Blenders – Hive-minded invasive species
The Blenders are my non-human antagonists. They are locked into the story, though I allow myself room to evolve their behavior and mechanics. They are serpentine tubes lined with rotating jaws, fat-hungry predators that target whales, seals, and eventually humans. They move fast in water, clumsy but relentless on land. They coordinate like a hive, with larger individuals directing the swarm. Rumors of cannibalism emphasize their brutality. From a symbolic standpoint, they represent unchecked consumption, environmental imbalance, and exploitative hierarchy. They are the monster-in-the-house, defined by clear feeding rules, growing stronger as they consume more fat. They bring horror, but also give me a framework to critique greed and consumption at ecological and social levels.

The Blenders – Two Perspectives
Diegetically, to the characters, the Blenders are existential terror, embodiments of the ocean’s anger. Academically, they’re invasive predators: tube-shaped bodies, concentric jaw propulsion, aquatic hunters who adapt to limited land mobility. Their hierarchy is size-based, their cannibalism ensures dominance of the largest, and they symbolize human systems that reward unchecked appetite. They are horror with rules, and they push every character to confront what happens when consumption knows no limit.

Optional Characters (Multiple-Choice Pool)

These are characters I keep flexible, drawn from earlier drafts or ensemble sketches. They give me levers to adjust tone, pacing, or theme as needed. I can fold them in or leave them out depending on how the script develops.

Julia Morita – A city council member focused on economics, persuasive and charismatic, but dismissive of the environment. She can represent political resistance.
Kalea Tomlinson – A freelance marine biologist, adaptable but skeptical of teamwork. She can challenge Maia scientifically.
Edward “Eddie” Masaki – Retired Coast Guard or reckless entrepreneur, humorous, thrill-seeking. He can illustrate the dangers of underestimating the threat.
Emily Santos – A community organizer, natural leader, who can clash with Maia but eventually unify townspeople.
Dr. Helena Ito – Visiting marine ecologist, pragmatic and detached. She can supply scientific solutions and learn community values.
Gabriel Reyes – A fisherman or caretaker who sacrifices himself, mirroring James and exploring martyrdom.
Russell Anderson – A wealthy tourist, comic relief, ignorant of danger. He embodies outsider blindness.
Ben and Kaipo – Prototypes from early outlines, folded into Maia and Leilani. I can resurrect them if I need a different dynamic.
Lily, Marcy, Bianca, and Greg – Minor community figures, from flyers to potential victims, they illustrate community diversity.
Dr. Ethan Takahashi – A scientist cameo, useful for exposition or equipment delivery.
Officer Gregson – A law-enforcement figure representing the official town response.
Fishermen, tourists, and townspeople – Community background, shaping stakes and showing Maui’s broader struggle.

These optional characters are tools in my kit. I can combine, reshape, or omit them entirely, depending on what the story demands. They give me flexibility to shift emphasis without weakening the core.
