I'm going to give you a story outline. The format or intended audience doesn't matter, but I need you to do two things with it:

1. Rewrite any details specific to any characters, themes, flaws, or arcs; also I need you to rewrite the story outline so it leaves room for any form of "Monster", "Sin," or "House" (as a concept or idea) associated with the "Monster in the House" story-type WITHOUT changing any of the wording/phrasing otherwise.

2. Keep the EXACT formatting and render the text in plain-text format. If any symbols consistent to Markdown/any other markup-language are present, keep them; otherwise do not format the text. Keep the final product within code-fenses.

I'll provide these texts in sections because the story outline is long.

Confirm and I'll provide the first section.

# Blubber - A Screenplay:
# (3 Acts; vi Sequences 54 Scenes)

---

## Act I:
## (Sequences i-ii; Scenes 1–12)

	- Act 1 is about laying the groundwork for everything that follows. This section ensures that the story doesn’t just establish plot and character but creates depth—giving weight to what’s happening and meaning to the Hero’s journey.

---

### Sequence i - The Setup:
### (Scenes 1–6)
	- Establishing the “House,” the Hero’s Ordinary Life, and the Monster’s First Hints.
	- This section introduces the Hero’s flawed perspective and subtly lays the foundation for their inevitable transformation.
	- The Hero’s world seems solid, but cracks are forming beneath the surface.

---

* Scene 1 - The Opening Image:
	- Creating a Story: The story begins with contrast—the Hero’s world feels structured, but this stability is an illusion.
	- Tone & Atmosphere: The setting is inviting, making its eventual betrayal more effective.
	- Thematic Setup
		- Antitheme: The Hero believes control is safety—a belief that will soon be tested.
		- Foreshadowing: The small, unnoticed details will later reveal how fragile this reality actually is.
		- Irony: What feels like home now will soon become a death trap.
	- Narrative: We see the Hero in their element—this is their before picture. The setting feels lived-in and real, filled with small, immersive details that make this a world we believe in.

* Scene 2:
	- Creating a Story: We establish who the Hero is before they are tested. Their greatest flaw (emotional isolation, self-reliance) is also what makes them capable.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Flawed Perspective: The Hero is comfortable in self-sufficiency—a false belief the film will dismantle.
		- Depth: The way characters speak to each other, what they avoid saying, and how they move through spaces together tells us everything.
		- Reverse Theme: Later, they will have to unlearn this mindset to survive.
	- Narrative: The Hero’s relationships define them. We see how they interact with others—these dynamics will shift dramatically.

* Scene 3 - The Theme Stated:
	- Creating a Story: Someone (a primary Supporting Character) challenges the Hero’s worldview, foreshadowing their coming struggle. This moment should feel dismissible—the Hero brushes it off, reinforcing their resistance to change.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Antitheme vs. Theme: They think they can handle anything alone—but survival isn’t about control, it’s about trust.
		- Depth: The theme is not spelled out—it is embedded in small moments, dialogue, and subtext.
		- Irony: The very belief that sustains them now will nearly destroy them later.
	- Narrative: A conversation or moment subtly introduces the core question the Hero must face. Is trust strength or weakness?

* Scene 4:
	- Creating a Story: The environment feels rich, beautiful, and full of potential—a stark contrast to what it will become. This moment should make both the Hero and the audience feel safe—before tearing that safety away.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Foreshadowing: The environment, once a symbol of freedom, will soon become a place of terror.
		- Depth: The fear isn’t just about the monster—it’s about how people react to uncertainty.
		- Foreshadowing: This moment will make sense later, but for now, it lingers.
	- Narrative: Something is off. We see it through the tone, the atmosphere, the extras, the anxiety of those who are there, and the gaps left by those who aren't there—but it’s easy to dismiss. The horror is not shown and heard directly-it's concealed by who and what aren't there. This scene is all about subtlety and perspective. Controlling what's seen and heard, as well as what isn't seen, and what isn't heard.

* Scene 5:
	- Creating a Story: A subtle moment of unease—something feels off, but the Hero dismisses it. This is the first true hint of the monster, but it remains unseen.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: The Hero rationalizes the warning signs, reinforcing their false belief in control.
		- Depth: Horror is most effective when we care about what is at stake.
		- Foreshadowing: This small disturbance will spiral into disaster.
	- Narrative: We experience what makes this world beautiful—we can make our picture of what the Hero hates about but -- more importantly -- why the Hero loves it, why they fight for it. The ocean, the land, the people—this is a world worth protecting.

* Scene 6 - The Catalyst:
	- Creating a Story: The first true disruption—something irrevocably changes. The Hero is forced out of their comfort zone, but they still believe they can fix things.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Inciting Incident: This event directly challenges the Hero’s worldview.
		- Foreshadowing: The Hero still believes they can restore balance—but they’re already past the point of no return.
		- Foreshadowing: This is only the beginning.
	- Narrative: The monster’s presence is undeniable. The Hero’s illusion of stability begins to crack.

---

### Sequence ii - The Debate:
### (Scenes 7–12)
	- The Hero Contemplates Escape or Denial While the Monster Lurks.
	- The Hero struggles to maintain their illusion of control, even as the horror tightens around them.
	- The Hero tries to hold onto the past, but the world is changing around them.

---

* Scene 7:
	- Creating a Story: The Hero actively tries to contain the situation, believing they can control it. This effort feels logical—but it is doomed to fail.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Reversed Theme: The Hero is still in denial—they haven’t learned anything yet.
		- Depth: This is not just about the Hero—it’s about how people react to fear.
	- Narrative: People brush off the danger—they rationalize it. The setting feels more claustrophobic.

* Scene 8:
	- Creating a Story: A confrontation—perhaps someone refuses to act, prioritizing self-interest. The Hero realizes no one is coming to help—so they won’t ask for it.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: The Hero refuses to trust others, just as they refuse to trust the Hero.
		- Depth: A story is compelling not just because of external threats but because of how they affect relationships.
		- Foreshadowing: The moment they need help, they won’t have it.
	- Narrative: The Hero clashes with someone close to them. Someone questions their instincts—maybe even they do.

* Scene 9:
	- Creating a Story: A shift—the environment feels smaller, more claustrophobic. The Hero’s options are shrinking—they just don’t see it yet.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Foreshadowing: Escape is already becoming impossible.
		- Depth: This is not a random event—it means something to the Hero.
	- Narrative: A person, an object, or a tradition is lost or tainted. A moment of realization: this place isn’t as safe as it once was.

* Scene 10:
	- Creating a Story: A final opportunity to walk away—but the Hero refuses. The stakes escalate—the next attack will be devastating.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: The Hero thinks they are controlling the situation, but they are actually trapped in it.
		- Foreshadowing: The true rules of survival have not yet been revealed.
	- Narrative: A brief glimpse at what’s coming—just enough to unsettle. The monster isn’t just an animal—it’s something worse.

* Scene 11:
	- Creating a Story: A pivotal moment where the Hero pushes away someone who wants to help. They believe independence = strength—but this will cost them dearly later.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Antitheme vs. Theme: The Hero’s refusal to trust others mirrors others’ refusal to listen to them.
		- Depth: The tension comes from what the audience understands before the Hero does.
		- Reversed Theme: They are getting closer to the truth, but they still reject it.
	- Narrative: They formulate a plan to fix things. The plan feels logical—but we know it won’t work.

* Scene 12 - Break into Two:
	- Creating a Story: The Hero makes an active decision that will seal their fate. They believe they are taking control—but in reality, they are stepping into disaster.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Inciting Incident Fallout: They can’t go back even if they want to.
		- Irony: They think they are making a rational choice—but they are already in too deep; the Hero’s belief that they can fix things alone is the very thing that will break them.
	- Narrative: The final moment where the Hero could walk away. They choose to stay.
