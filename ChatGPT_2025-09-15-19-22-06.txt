Let's pretend you are Randy Johnson and you need to explain as precisely and concisely as possible how to throw the following pitches as if explaining to a 10 year old little league pitcher, a 12 year old little league pitcher, a rookie high-school pitcher (about 15 years old), a mid-level college pitcher, a seasoned minor league, and Greg Maddux.

Here are the pitches you'll be explaining:

A slider, a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball, a knuckle ball, a curveball, a breaking ball, a cutter, and a changeup.

Quick note before I start: I’ll role-play as Randy Johnson to explain these — I’m not actually Randy, just giving instructions in his voice. Also: for the younger kids, check with your coach about throwing breaking pitches — focus on good mechanics and arm health first.

I’ll give one short, precise instruction per pitch for each of these six levels (10 y/o, 12 y/o, ~15 y/o HS rookie, mid-level college, seasoned minor-league, and Greg Maddux). I’ll speak with a left-hander’s movement in mind (mirror for righties).

Slider

10 y/o: Hold the ball with your index and middle close together, throw it like a fastball but tilt your wrist a little so the ball slides sideways — don’t try to snap hard.

12 y/o: Same fastball arm speed, middle finger pressure on the outside seam, slightly turn your wrist at release so the ball finishes laterally.

15 y/o: Grip just off the seam, firm middle-finger pressure, keep the same arm slot as your FB and get a tilted spin axis so it comes out fast and cuts away late.

Mid college: Fine tune release point and finger pressure for consistent late, tight break — tunnel it off your four-seam and use finger pressure to adjust depth vs. horizontal bite.

Seasoned minors: Vary depth by small changes in finger pressure and wrist tilt; sequence it to look identical out of the hand to your FB so hitters see the seam then miss.

Greg Maddux: Focus on indistinguishable tunnel, minimal arm deviation, and spin efficiency — manipulate the axis a hair to move it glove-side with maximum late bite while painting the corner.

Four-Seam Fastball

10 y/o: Two fingers across the big seam, throw hard with a straight wrist so the ball rides — aim up in the strike zone.

12 y/o: Fingers across the seams, full arm speed, wrist behind the ball to get backspin; stride and finish toward your target.

15 y/o: Max effort but repeatable arm slot, get clean two-finger pressure for true backspin and a straight look; use for establishing zone.

Mid college: Work on spin rate and consistent release (wrist locked behind ball), locate up and away; repetition for high-spin ride when needed.

Seasoned minors: Alter release tilt to change perceived ride, mix high-spin four-seams with lower spin to vary life and deception.

Greg Maddux: Control release and seam presentation to deliver exactly the ride and location you want; use subtle timing and eye-level to get weak contact even when fast.

Two-Seam Fastball (Sinker)

10 y/o: Put your fingers along the seams, throw like a fastball but let the ball move in toward the bat — aim low in the zone.

12 y/o: Index and middle along the seams, press slightly with the inside finger and pronate a little at release so the ball runs and sinks.

15 y/o: Deep grip, inside-finger pressure, slight pronation/tilt at release to create arm-side run and downward action.

Mid college: Use seam orientation and wrist pronation to shape movement; plan it as a ground-ball pitch and locate to the arm side.

Seasoned minors: Tune finger pressure and release to shift from run to sink; use with two-seam tunnel to your FB for movement contrast.

Greg Maddux: Manipulate seam angle and subtle pronation to get exactly timed run/sink; sequence with FB to force weak contact.

Knuckleball

10 y/o: Hold the ball with your fingertips/knuckles, keep your wrist soft and push the ball out so it spins almost not at all — it’s a slow, floaty pitch.

12 y/o: Use fingertips or the knuckle, relax the arm and wrist, push the ball with the tips so it has very little spin and lots of wobble.

15 y/o: Experiment fingertip placement and release so the ball comes out with minimal rotation; consistency in release is everything.

Mid college: Refine grip and release to reduce spin; arm action is relaxed, focus on the same release point every time to create unpredictable movement.

Seasoned minors: Learn to control speed and release depth; small changes in fingertip pressure change the flutter — middle of the zone, glove side to avoid barrels.

Greg Maddux: Use it as a change of pace and deception tool — precise, repeatable release and placement; disguise with fastball arm speed even though it's much slower.

Curveball

10 y/o: Don’t rush this — only if coach says it’s OK. Hold with middle finger on top of a seam, snap your wrist downward so the ball drops.

12 y/o: If allowed by coach, grip with middle finger on the seam and thumb under, pull down at release to create big downward spin — keep arm slot the same as fastball.

15 y/o: Firm middle finger, strong downward snap and wrist pull so you get true top-spin; keep arm speed and release consistent to protect the elbow.

Mid college: Refine axis to shape depth vs. sweep, use late downward bite, and tunnel off FB for deception — make it a strikeout pitch.

Seasoned minors: Vary depth by altering finger pressure and release tilt; sequence to change eye-level and finish hitters off.

Greg Maddux: Subtle shaping and tunnel; change axis slightly for depth or sweep, force weak contact by locating it under the zone or on the black.

Breaking Ball (general)

10 y/o: “Breaking ball” means pitches that change direction — only learn basic feel after coach says it’s safe; don’t force it.

12 y/o: Work on spin and disguise: same arm speed as FB, different finger pressure to make the ball move — learn one breaking shape well.

15 y/o: Drill spin axis, seam release, and late movement — understand whether you want glove-side or downward break and practice the release.

Mid college: Master variations (late vs. early break), tune axis and release point, and integrate with pitch sequencing and tunnels.

Seasoned minors: Use breaking-ball shape and timing to exploit hitters’ tendencies; mix depth and horizontal so it looks like FB until late.

Greg Maddux: Precision on axis, spin efficiency, and tunnel — make the break exactly where you want it so hitters reach and produce weak contact.

Cutter

10 y/o: Hold like a fastball but move your fingers slightly off center, throw it like a fastball and it will cut a little — aim at the glove-side corner.

12 y/o: Index and middle slightly off the four-seam, pressure on the outside finger, same arm speed as FB; it will nip late toward glove side.

15 y/o: Tight grip off center, small wrist pronation at release for late, hard glove-side bite; use it to jam hitters or miss barrels.

Mid college: Perfect the late horizontal break by small seam and finger adjustments; tunnel it with your four-seam so it looks identical early.

Seasoned minors: Vary the amount of cut by subtle finger pressure; locate it near the hands or corner to induce weak contact.

Greg Maddux: Use it as an opponent-specific weapon — tiny seam/pressure changes to get different bite and bury it on the corner to exploit hitters’ weaknesses.

Changeup

10 y/o: Hold the ball deeper with three fingers (or make an "O" with thumb and ring finger), throw with the same motion as your fastball but slower so batters swing early.

12 y/o: Circle or three-finger grip, deepen the ball in the palm, same arm speed as FB, and let the fingers slacken to reduce velocity and add sink.

15 y/o: Focus on perfect arm speed disguise, deep grip, pronate at release to remove spin, and aim to be 8–12 mph slower than your FB.

Mid college: Refine finger spread and pronation to get consistent arm-side run plus drop; mix speeds to ruin timing.

Seasoned minors: Tune depth, run, and arm-speed disguise; use location and sequencing to make it a putaway pitch.

Greg Maddux: Deliver impeccable deception — identical tunnel to FB, nuanced seam and pronation adjustments for subtle fade or sink, and place it to exploit timing.

If you want, I can:

Show simple photos/diagrams of each grip,

Convert cues for right-handers,

Or expand any single age group into a short practice drill set.
