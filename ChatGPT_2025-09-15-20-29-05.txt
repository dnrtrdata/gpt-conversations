THE “MONTAUK PROJECT” CONSPIRACY
Everyone loves a good conspiracy. We've seen the most well-known, Area 51 and The
Philadelphia Experiment, sensationalized on film and television many times before. But the
Montauk Project, one of the most bizarre conspiracies in our country’s history, remains
untapped.
In 1942, as World War II raged across the ocean, the Air Force established Camp Hero on
the eastern-most point of Long Island -- Montauk. Blighting the quaint, picturesque resort
town that would serve as Peter Benchley’s inspiration for Amity in Jaws, the base’s initial
objective was to protect America against possible German invasion. The already enormous
base was later expanded during the Cold War. A long-range radar dish was added and it
became a focal point of Soviet surveillance. Around this time, the base allegedly began to
conduct a series of top-secret experiments. Codename: The Montauk Project.
The Montauk Project involved the most cutting-edge developments in science. No one
knows for sure what these experiments entailed, but the chatter runs a gamut of the weird
and wonderful. Alien contact... time travel... telepathy... alternate dimensions... mutant
monsters... you name it, someone claims it happened at this base.

STORY
We begin at Camp Hero in the fall of 1980, a few months before the base will be shut
down by the ULS. government. A mysterious experiment has gone horribly awry. And
something has gotten out.
On this very night, a young boy, WILL BYERS, vanishes into thin air. His disappearance has
a potent effect on the small town community, particularly on his best friend, MIKE
WHEELER, his brother, JONATHAN, his mother, JOYCE, and the reluctant Chief of
Police, JIM “HOP” HOPPER. We will follow each of these characters as they grapple with
and investigate Will’s disappearance.
As they peel back the layers of this mystery, they will all arrive at the same shocking conclusion: Will was abducted by supernatural entities which were inadvertently released
during an experiment. These entities exist between dimensions and have begun to feed on
life from our world -- Will’s disappearance is only the beginning. =a
Over the course of the series, the “tear” or “rip” that separates their world from ours will
begin to spread across Montauk like a supernatural cancer. This cancer will manifest itself in
increasingly bizarre paranormal ways. Electrical fields will be disrupted. Strange fungi will
grow on structures and people. A heavy fog will drift in from the Atlantic. The temperature
will plummet. Food will rot. Gravity will fluctuate. People will glimpse bizarre entities in
their homes and businesses. There will be an escalating number of “vanishings.” The entire
town will become “haunted” -- and in grave danger. If people can disappear... can an entire
town?
In order to save Will and the town, our heroes will have to outsmart FEDERAL AGENTS
and tap into the preternatural abilities of a mysterious child telepath named ELEVEN, who
has recently escaped from Camp Hero. Eleven will ultimately give them access to this
“in-between” dimension, a nightmarish reflection of our own, where they will find
themselves face to face with unimaginable horrors -- horrors from which some of them
will never escape. Those who do will be forever changed.

STRUCTURE
Montauk will be structured like a film. There will be a definitive beginning, middle, and
end. There will be no loose ends after the finale, and all of our lead characters will have
complete arcs. [he limited nature of the project will allow us to target film actors for the
adult leads. For example, Ewan McGregor or Sam Rockwell for Hopper, Naomi Watts or
Marisa Tomei for Joyce.
ACT ONE (episodes 1-3) will depict the “vanishing” of Will Byers and the resulting fallout
in the community. Chief Hopper will investigate the disappearance, only to find his case
obstructed at every turn by shadowy federal agents; Mike will meet and bond with Eleven;
Jonathan will become fixated on a supernatural “tear” inside his shed; Joyce will make
paranormal contact with Will. By the end of the act, our disparate characters will all arrive
at the same conclusion: Will was abducted by supernatural forces and taken into a realm
which exists beyond human senses.
ACT TWO (episodes 4-6) will have the town of Montauk becoming increasingly “haunted,”
raising the stakes as our characters desperately attempt to uncover the mystery. Several
peripheral characters will come to the forefront, including TERRY IVES, a local conspiracy
theorist, and MR. CLARKE, a middle school science teacher. We will also delve deeper
into Eleven’s terrifying backstory, and Mike will travel into this alternate dimension for the
first time. He will return with proof that Will is alive. But if he wants to save him, he will
need help. This act will end with our disparate characters and storylines coming together.
ACT THREE (episodes 7-8) will climax with characters working together to outsmart the
military, venture into this alternate dimension, save Will, and, hopefully, close this “tear”
once and for all.

TONE AND STYLE
The visual style will be energetic, creative, and cinematic. The framing will be bold; the
_ cinematography will be dark and constantly on the move; the pacing will be fast.
_ Since Montauk is set in the fall of 1980, the show will feature many period details (wood
paneled station wagons, analog technology, Empire Strikes Back in theaters, Blondie on the
radio, etc.). While this will add a fun nostalgia factor to the show, these details must never
overwhelm the story or characters; Spielberg’s early films have a certain timeless quality to
them, and we will strive for the same.
The soundtrack should similarly feel period but timeless. Classic songs will only come from
sources such as radios and TVs; most of the music will be original, which we imagine as a
cinematic, eerie, modern synth sound, inspired by classic early John Carpenter scores like
The Thing and The Fog.

HORROR
The horror in Montauk is supernatural -- but rooted in science. Dark matter, black holes,
worm holes, alternate universes, string theory... we want to use the mathematics of
theoretical physics to ground our horror in reality.
Our supernatural entities will remain mostly obscured throughout, hidden in the shadows,
tucked away just off screen. When we do glimpse them, they will be terrifying,
unforgettable, strange, their design taking inspiration from the masters of the grotesque:
Clive Barker, Guillermo Del Toro, H.R. Giger, and Masahiro Ito (Silent Hill). To believably
realize our entities on screen, we plan to employ a combination of prosthetics, trained
movement artists, subtle CGI, and some good old-fashioned fog and shadow.
The show will also prominently feature yet another type of horror: the human kind.'The
supernatural terrors unleashed on our town will in certain ways personify the evil that
exists beneath the perfect facade of this small town. Abuse, divorce, violence, cruelty,
substance abuse, depression, death... our characters will struggle with the darkness of the
human condition. How do you cope with the abundance of evil in this world? And, in the
end, is it worth it?

4HE KIDS
MIKE WHEELER is twelve. He is a cute kid, but a birthmark on his left cheek leads to
much bullying and near-crippling insecurity. He has never had a first kiss, much less a
girlfriend. He escapes his insecurities through reading fantasy novels, spending time with
his three best friends (Lucas, Dustin, and Will), and retreating into his own vivid
imagination. [he Dungeon Master of his Dungeons and Dragons group, he writes sprawling
adventures with fantastical monsters. When he finds himself on a real adventure, facing real
monsters, he will discover a courage he didn’t know he had. By the end, he will even kiss a
girl.
LUCAS CONLEY, twelve, is Mike’s best friend. He lives only a few houses away. He is
scrawny, short, loudmouthed. Initially a source of comic relief, his character will darken
and deepen over the course of the series. His wealthy parents are in the midst of costly
divorce; vitriolic arguments are a daily occurrence. As a result, he will grow angry and
destructive. His attitude will land his friends in danger more than once and put his
friendship with Mike to the test.
WILL BYERS, twelve, is a sweet, sensitive kid with sexual identity issues. He only recently
came to the realization that he does not fit into 1980s definition of “normal.” His innocent
choices, such as his colorful clothes, prove a constant source of bullying. Like Mike, Will
escapes through fantasy gaming, where he can be himself, uninhibited. He has a close relationship with his mother, Joyce. His brother, Jonathan, helps raise him in lieu of their father,
who abandoned them four years ago.
DUSTIN HENDERSON, twelve, is the “King Geek.” He is overweight and wears oversized
glasses. His supportive parents are nerds themselves and are supportive of his choices and
hobbies. However, Dustin finds less acceptance at school, where is often bullied for his
weight and interests. He frequently bickers with Lucas; their arguments are good-natured S
at first, but escalate as the stakes rise.

THE OUTSIDER
ELEVEN was an orphan with telekinesis. Her preternatural abilities have been linked to
: genetic mutations caused by her mother’s drug use. When she was just two years old, she
was taken for experiments by a clandestine faction of the U.S. military. She has subsequently lived out the majority of her life in a small cell beneath Camp Hero. During this time,
she and a group of other children (One to Ten) were subjected to a series of painful, dangerous experiments. Her powers proved greater than the other children and she began to
receive special attention from Agent One. Outside of Agent One, she has little experience
interacting with others and has no memory of the outside world. When she escapes the
laboratory at the start of our series, she finds herself experiencing real life for the first
time. This proves both pee . and thrilling. If Mike is the Elliot of our show, Eleven is
our “E.T.”

THE TEENAGERS
JONATHAN BYERS, sixteen, is mysterious, quiet, with artistic leanings and a lifelong love
(and talent) for photography. He finds his social life constantly stifled by his responsibilities
to his family. He works at the local movie theater to help his mother pay rent; the rest of his
time is spent taking care of his kid brother, Will. While he loves his family very much, he
also feels burdened by them. He has no friends at school and has never had a girlfriend.
Over the course of the series, he will begin a relationship with Nancy Wheeler. This will
force him to open up and, for the first time, let someone in.
NANCY WHEELER, sixteen, is an awkward, booksmart teen who is in the early stages of
becoming a beautiful woman. But with her newfound looks comes unexpected pain; her
first fling with Steve, a popular teen, leads to heartbreak and humiliation. This experience
will drive her unexpectedly into the arms of another: Jonathan. With his help, she will
experience love for the first time... and find herself.

THE ADULIS
JIM “HOP” HOPPER, early 40s, is the Chief of the Montauk police. He grew up in
Montauk but moved to the city immediately post-graduation. He made a happy life there,
but it was shattered when a tragic car accident killed his four-year-old daughter. He
retreated to his hometown and now lives a hedonistic lifestyle in a shack by the beach. He
drinks heavily, chain smokes, and abuses Tuinal, a potent barbiturate popular at the time
(which has since been banned). Hopper took the job of Chief not to help others but
because it required very little of him. After all, nothing bad ever happens in Montauk. Or
so he thought. This changes when Will goes missing. In order to stop this evil from
spreading, Hopper will have no choice but to confront the darkness of his past.
JOYCE BYERS, early 40s, is the single mother of Will and Jonathan. She struggles to raise
them while holding down two low-paying jobs with long hours. She chain smokes, speaks
with a thick Long Island accent, and has blunt manners. Despite all this, she is a loving
mother who would go to incredible lengths to protect her boys. Over the course of the
show, Joyce's desperation will lead her into an unexpected and rocky relationship with
Hopper.
MR. CLARKE, 35, is the rock star of the local middle school. Charismatic, charming,
handsome, and whip-smart, he is the closest thing our series has to Indiana Jones. Mr.
Clarke will become increasingly essential as the show moves forward, as he will be key to
solving the mystery of what has happened in Montauk. He will ultimately help our
characters breach the Tear in Act Three.
TERRY IVES, 40, mentioned only passingly in the pilot, will play an important role in
episodes to come. An anti-social hermit and local movie theater projectionist with the looks
of a serial killer (balding hair, big oval glasses), Terry is a conspiracy nut and has been
investigating Camp Hero for over a decade. Although initially derided by Hopper and
others, he will become an unexpected, albeit reluctant, hero in the dark days ahead. He
might even make a friend or two along the way.

FRANCHISE POTENTIAL
_ Even though Montauk is designed as a stand-alone eight-hour tale, the story can continue in
subsequent installments. The hypothetical sequel will take place in the same town, only ten
years later, in the summer of 1990. Our kids will now be young adults with new lives, new
problems; many of them will have moved out of Montauk, spread out across the country
for school and work. But the re-emergence of horror in Montauk will bring them back to
their hometown, where they will have no choice but to join forces again. This will allow us
_ to explore many of the same characters, themes, and horrors from the original series, but
~ with a new ensemble of actors and a fresh time period.

Here’s a cleaned-up, cohesive version of the document:

MONTAUK: INTRODUCTION
Montauk is an eight-hour sci-fi horror epic set in Long Island in 1980, inspired by the supernatural classics of that era. It explores the crossroads where the ordinary meets the extraordinary.

Imagine the feeling of fear and wonder as Elliott approaches a fog-drenched shed in E.T.… the helpless dread consuming Chief Brody as he watches a boy and his raft dragged under in Jaws… the crackling television in Poltergeist… the horror of a cackling clown in It… or the friendship and adventure of Stand By Me.

Montauk is a love letter to the golden age of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, blending human drama with supernatural fear in an emotional and cinematic story deeply rooted in character.

THE “MONTAUK PROJECT” CONSPIRACY
Everyone loves a good conspiracy, and Montauk draws on one of the most bizarre and untapped in American history.

In 1942, during World War II, the Air Force established Camp Hero on the easternmost point of Long Island—Montauk. Initially intended to protect against a possible German invasion, the base expanded during the Cold War, adding a long-range radar dish and becoming a focal point of Soviet surveillance.

Around this time, rumors began circulating about secret experiments conducted at the base, codenamed “The Montauk Project.” Alleged experiments included alien contact, time travel, telepathy, alternate dimensions, and mutant creatures.

STORY
The story begins in the fall of 1980, just months before Camp Hero is scheduled to shut down. A mysterious experiment has gone horribly wrong, and something has escaped.

That same night, twelve-year-old Will Byers vanishes without a trace. His disappearance shakes the tight-knit community, especially his best friend, Mike Wheeler; his older brother, Jonathan; his mother, Joyce; and the reluctant Chief of Police, Jim “Hop” Hopper.

As the characters investigate Will’s disappearance, they uncover a shocking truth: Will has been taken by supernatural entities released during an experiment. These creatures exist between dimensions and feed on life from our world. Will’s disappearance is just the beginning.

The rift separating their world from ours begins spreading across Montauk like a supernatural cancer, manifesting in bizarre ways: electrical disruptions, strange fungi, heavy fog, plummeting temperatures, gravity fluctuations, and a growing number of vanishings. The entire town becomes haunted.

To save Will and the town, our heroes must outwit federal agents and rely on Eleven, a mysterious child telepath who recently escaped from Camp Hero. Eleven’s abilities grant them access to the nightmarish dimension where Will is trapped. Facing unimaginable horrors, some characters will not survive, and those who do will be forever changed.

STRUCTURE
Montauk is structured like a film, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Each lead character will have a complete arc, and there will be no loose ends after the finale. The limited series format will allow for targeting high-profile film actors for adult roles.

Act One (Episodes 1-3): Will Byers vanishes, causing turmoil in the community. Chief Hopper’s investigation is obstructed by federal agents. Mike meets Eleven, Jonathan becomes obsessed with a tear in his shed, and Joyce makes paranormal contact with Will. By the end of Act One, the characters realize Will has been taken by supernatural forces.

Act Two (Episodes 4-6): The town becomes increasingly haunted. Terry Ives, a conspiracy theorist, and Mr. Clarke, a middle school science teacher, take on larger roles. Eleven’s backstory is revealed, and Mike ventures into the alternate dimension for the first time, returning with proof that Will is alive.

Act Three (Episodes 7-8): The characters band together to outsmart the military, enter the alternate dimension, save Will, and attempt to close the tear for good.

TONE AND STYLE
The visual style will be energetic, creative, and cinematic, with bold framing and dynamic cinematography. Set in the fall of 1980, the show will include nostalgic period details like analog technology, wood-paneled station wagons, and Blondie on the radio. These details, however, will never overshadow the story.

The soundtrack will feature period-appropriate songs through diegetic sources like radios, while the score will consist of eerie, modern synth music inspired by John Carpenter’s early work (The Thing, The Fog).

HORROR
The horror in Montauk is both supernatural and grounded in science. Using theoretical physics concepts like dark matter, wormholes, and alternate dimensions, the story roots its terror in plausible science.

The supernatural entities will remain mostly obscured, appearing in shadows or off-screen, with their design inspired by Clive Barker, Guillermo Del Toro, H.R. Giger, and Masahiro Ito (Silent Hill). A mix of prosthetics, movement artists, subtle CGI, and atmospheric effects like fog and shadow will bring them to life.

The show will also explore human horrors, such as abuse, violence, addiction, and grief, as the supernatural events reflect the darkness beneath Montauk’s idyllic facade.

CHARACTERS

Mike Wheeler (12): A cute but insecure kid bullied for his birthmark. The Dungeon Master of his D&D group, he escapes into fantasy. Over the series, Mike discovers inner courage and even experiences his first kiss.

Lucas Conley (12): Mike’s scrawny, loudmouthed best friend. Initially comic relief, Lucas’s parents’ divorce drives him toward anger and destructive behavior, testing his friendship with Mike.

Will Byers (12): Sensitive and grappling with his identity, Will faces constant bullying. He escapes through fantasy gaming and has a close bond with his mother, Joyce, and older brother, Jonathan.

Dustin Henderson (12): A lovable nerd with supportive parents. Dustin is often teased for his weight and interests but remains the group’s “King Geek.”

Eleven: An orphan with telekinesis, Eleven was experimented on at Camp Hero due to genetic mutations linked to her mother’s drug use. Escaping the lab, she experiences life—and friendship—for the first time.

Jonathan Byers (16): A quiet, artistic teen with a love for photography. Overwhelmed by family responsibilities, Jonathan works at a movie theater to support his mother and younger brother. His relationship with Nancy forces him to open up emotionally.

Nancy Wheeler (16): An awkward but beautiful bookworm. Nancy’s heartbreak with Steve leads her to Jonathan, with whom she experiences love and self-discovery.

Jim “Hop” Hopper (early 40s): A jaded, self-destructive police chief haunted by the loss of his daughter. Initially apathetic, Hopper finds redemption through his investigation into Will’s disappearance.
