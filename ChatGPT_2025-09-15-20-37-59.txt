I'm going to give you a story outline. The format or intended audience doesn't matter, but I need you to do two things with it:

1. Remove mention of any details that are specific to any one story, instead generalizing those details to be relevant to any "Monster in the House" story WITHOUT changing any of the wording/phrasing otherwise.

2. Keep the EXACT formatting and render the text in plain-text format. If any symbols consistent to Markdown/any other markup-language are present, keep them; otherwise do not format the text. Keep the final product within code-fenses.

I'll provide these texts in sections because the story outline is long.

Confirm and I'll provide the first section.

Here's the first section:

# Blubber - A Screenplay:
# (3 Acts; vi Sequences 54 Scenes)

---

## Act I:
## (Sequences i-ii; Scenes 1–12)

	- Act 1 is about laying the groundwork for everything that follows. This section ensures that the story doesn’t just establish plot and character but creates depth—giving weight to what’s happening and meaning to Maia’s journey.


---

### Sequence i - The Setup:
### (Scenes 1–6)
	- Establishing the “House,” the Hero’s Ordinary Life, and the Monster’s First Hints.
	- This section introduces Maia’s flawed perspective and subtly lays the foundation for her inevitable transformation.
	- Maia’s world seems solid, but cracks are forming beneath the surface.

---

* Scene 1 - The Opening Image:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The story begins with contrast—Maia’s world feels structured, but this stability is an illusion.
	- Tone & Atmosphere: The setting is inviting, making its eventual betrayal more effective.
	- Thematic Setup
		- Antitheme: Maia believes control is safety—a belief that will soon be tested.
		- Foreshadowing: The small, unnoticed details will later reveal how fragile this reality actually is.
		- Irony: What feels like home now will soon become a death trap.
	- Narrative in Action: We see Maia in her element—this is her before picture. The setting feels lived-in and real, filled with small, immersive details that make this a world we believe in.

* Scene 2:
	- Creating a Story in Action: We establish who Maia is before she is tested. Her greatest flaw (emotional isolation, self-reliance) is also what makes her capable.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Flawed Perspective: Maia is comfortable in self-sufficiency—a false belief the film will dismantle.
		- Depth: The way characters speak to each other, what they avoid saying, and how they move through spaces together tells us everything.
		- Reverse Theme: Later, she will have to unlearn this mindset to survive.
	- Narrative in Action: Maia’s relationships define her. We see how she interacts with Noah, Sofia, and Derek—these dynamics will shift dramatically.

* Scene 3 - The Theme Stated:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Someone (a primary Supporting Character) challenges Maia’s worldview, foreshadowing her coming struggle. This moment should feel dismissible—Maia brushes it off, reinforcing her resistance to change.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Antitheme vs. Theme: She thinks she can handle anything alone—but survival isn’t about control, it’s about trust.
		- Depth: The theme is not spelled out—it is embedded in small moments, dialogue, and subtext.
		- Irony: The very belief that sustains her now will nearly destroy her later.
	- Narrative in Action: A conversation or moment subtly introduces the core question Maia must face. Is trust strength or weakness?

* Scene 4:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The environment feels rich, beautiful, and full of potential—a stark contrast to what it will become. This moment should make both Maia and the audience feel safe—before tearing that safety away.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Foreshadowing: The ocean, once a symbol of freedom, will soon become a place of terror.
		- Depth: The fear isn’t just about the monster—it’s about how people react to uncertainty.
		- Foreshadowing: This moment will make sense later, but for now, it lingers.
	- Narrative in Action: Something is off. We see it through the tone, the atmosphere, the extras, the anxiety of those who are there, and the gaps left by those who aren't there—but it’s easy to dismiss. The horror is not shown and heard directly-it's concealed by who and what aren't there. This scene is all about subtlety and perspective. Controlling what's seen and heard, as well as what isn't seen, and what isn't heard.

* Scene 5:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A subtle moment of unease—something feels off, but Maia dismisses it. This is the first true hint of the monster, but it remains unseen.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: Maia rationalizes the warning signs, reinforcing her false belief in control.
		- Depth: Horror is most effective when we care about what is at stake.
		- Foreshadowing: This small disturbance will spiral into disaster.
	- Narrative in Action: We experience what makes this world beautiful—we can make our picture of what Maia hates about but -- more importantly -- why Maia loves it, why she fights for it. The ocean, the land, the people—this is a world worth protecting.

* Scene 6 - The Catalyst:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The first true disruption—something irrevocably changes. Maia is forced out of her comfort zone, but she still believes she can fix things.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Inciting Incident: This event directly challenges Maia’s worldview.
		- Foreshadowing: Maia still believes she can restore balance—but she’s already past the point of no return.
		- Foreshadowing: This is only the beginning.
	- Narrative in Action: The monster’s presence is undeniable. Maia’s illusion of stability begins to crack.

---

### Sequence ii - The Debate:
### (Scenes 7–12)
	- The Hero Contemplates Escape or Denial While the Monster Lurks.
	- Maia struggles to maintain her illusion of control, even as the horror tightens around her.
	- Maia tries to hold onto the past, but the world is changing around her.

---

* Scene 7:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Maia actively tries to contain the situation, believing she can control it. This effort feels logical—but it is doomed to fail.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Reversed Theme: Maia is still in denial—she hasn’t learned anything yet.
		- Depth: This is not just about Maia—it’s about how people react to fear.
	- Narrative in Action: People brush off the danger—they rationalize it. The setting feels more claustrophobic.

* Scene 8:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A confrontation—perhaps Nalani refuses to act, prioritizing tourism. Maia realizes no one is coming to help—so she won’t ask for it.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: Maia refuses to trust others, just as they refuse to trust her.
		- Depth: A story is compelling not just because of external threats but because of how they affect relationships.
		- Foreshadowing: The moment she needs help, she won’t have it.
	- Narrative in Action: Maia clashes with Noah, Derek, or Sofia. Someone questions her instincts—maybe even she does.

* Scene 9:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A shift—the island feels smaller, more claustrophobic. Maia’s options are shrinking—she just doesn’t see it yet.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Foreshadowing: Escape is already becoming impossible.
		- Depth: This is not a random event—it means something to Maia.
	- Narrative in Action: A person, an object, or a tradition is lost or tainted. A moment of realization: this place isn’t as safe as it once was.

* Scene 10:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A final opportunity to walk away—but Maia refuses. The stakes escalate—the next attack will be devastating.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: Maia thinks she is controlling the situation, but she is actually trapped in it.
		- Foreshadowing: The true rules of survival have not yet been revealed.
	- Narrative in Action: A brief glimpse at what’s coming—just enough to unsettle. The monster isn’t just an animal—it’s something worse.

* Scene 11:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A pivotal moment where Maia pushes away someone who wants to help. She believes independence = strength—but this will cost her dearly later.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Antitheme vs. Theme: Maia’s refusal to trust others mirrors the town’s refusal to listen to her.
		- Depth: The tension comes from what the audience understands before Maia does.
		- Reversed Theme: She is getting closer to the truth, but she still rejects it.
	- Narrative in Action: She formulates a plan to fix things. The plan feels logical—but we know it won’t work.

* Scene 12 - Break into Two:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Maia makes an active decision that will seal her fate. She believes she is taking control—but in reality, she is stepping into disaster.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Inciting Incident Fallout: She can’t go back even if she wants to.
		- Irony: She thinks she is making a rational choice—but she is already in too deep; Maia’s belief that she can fix things alone is the very thing that will break her.
	- Narrative in Action: The final moment where Maia could walk away. She chooses to stay.

	- Thematic Setup:
		- Foreshadowing: The final confrontation will be inescapable.

	- Narrative in Action: The monster does something the Hero thought impossible. This is no longer about survival—it’s about war.

	- Creating a Story in Action: A breakthrough—the monster is more than it seemed. Maybe it is not just instinct-driven—it is strategic.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Irony: The more the Hero learns, the more hopeless survival seems; the moment people wake up is also the moment they realize there’s no escape.

## (Scenes 43–54)

---

### (Scenes 43–54)

	- Maia isn’t just trying to survive anymore—she is actively fighting for something greater.

---

* Scene 43:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Maia rallies her allies—they are no longer scattered or passive. The monster is now the one on borrowed time.

	- Creating a Story in Action: The Blenders have one final trick Maia didn’t anticipate. The plan is thrown into chaos.
	- Thematic Setup: Trust, once dismissed as weakness, becomes the source of strength.
		- Irony: Just when Maia thought she was in control, the monster reminds her that she isn’t; Maia only becomes a leader after abandoning her need to lead alone.
		- Foreshadowing: This won’t be a clean victory.
	- Narrative in Action: The team—fractured before—follows her willingly. Even in silence, there is a sense of unity and trust.

* Scene 45:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Someone (Noah? Derek? A major secondary character?) is lost or gravely injured. Maia must decide whether to keep fighting or cut losses.
	- Thematic Setup: The story is not telling us she’s changed—it’s showing us.
		- Irony: Her greatest fear wasn’t fighting alone—it was leading people to their deaths.
		- Depth: her physical choices mirror her internal shift.
	- Narrative in Action: A tactical confrontation begins—but Maia doesn’t fight it the old way. She applies what she’s learned about the monster, and about herself.

* Scene 46:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Maia commits fully to the fight—no hesitation. The monster is lured into the final confrontation.
	- Thematic Setup: She is no longer the girl from The Opening Image. This is not improvisation—it is evolution.
		- Antitheme vs. Theme: Maia choosing to act as a leader rather than an isolated fighter.
		- Synthesis: This is her transformation in action.
	- Narrative in Action: The monster adapts. The plan starts to falter. Maia resists panic, finds a new path mid-crisis.

* Scene 47:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Everything Maia has learned comes into play. She isn’t just outmuscling the monster—she is outthinking it.
	- Thematic Setup: The stakes are no longer about winning, but about protecting; her worst fear—losing someone because she let them in—is faced head-on.
		- Irony: Maia is winning not because she is strongest, but because she is willing to trust others.
		- Foreshadowing: The victory isn’t yet complete.
	- Narrative in Action: A primary Supporting Character is in danger. Maia’s response shows her growth—she no longer hesitates, and no longer sacrifices connection for safety.

* Scene 48:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The Blenders unleash a final, desperate attack. It’s Maia vs. the monster—no more backup.
	- Thematic Setup: The monster has become the expression of every fear Maia had repressed.
It isn’t just dangerous—it’s personal.
		- Irony: The one time Maia is truly alone, she isn’t afraid anymore.
Narrative in Action: The monster changes again. It’s not just bigger—it’s smarter. The final confrontation is set in motion.

* Scene 49:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Maia must make the final, irreversible choice. This should cost her something permanent—physically, emotionally, or both.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Synthesis: The moment where Maia proves she has fully changed.
		- Depth: this isn’t a tactical decision—it’s emotional, ideological, and meaningful.
		- Narrative clarity: this is the synthesis of everything the story has been building toward.
	- Narrative in Action: Maia pushes deeper into enemy territory—not as a soldier, but as someone fully committed to saving others. She makes herself bait—not because she wants to die, but because she finally understands sacrifice.

* Scene 50:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The Blenders are destroyed—or driven away. But victory does not feel clean.
	- Thematic Setup: Survival is not dominance—it is understanding, adaptation, and connection. This isn’t Maia outpowering the threat—it’s Maia outgrowing it.
		- Irony: Maia won, but at a cost she never anticipated.
	- Narrative in Action: The final battle. It’s not clean. It’s desperate, physical, terrifying. Maia uses a mix of learned tactics and improvisation—but most of all, empathy and instinct.

* Scene 51:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The survivors reconvene—everything has changed. Maia is no longer the same person.

* Scene 52:
	- Creating a Story in Action: Maia faces the fallout—who lived, who didn’t, and what was lost. This is where the weight of survival hits.
	- Thematic Setup: The world is changed because Maia changed. Even in stillness, the weight of transformation is present.
		- Irony: She thought survival was the goal—but survival is just the beginning.
	- Narrative in Action: Survivors emerge. The community begins to stir. There is no “return to normal”—only a new beginning.

* Scene 53:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The island feels different now—not because it has changed, but because Maia has. She is seeing everything through new eyes.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Synthesis: This is the final proof of her transformation; synthesis made visible-we don’t need her to explain who she is now—we already know.
	- Narrative in Action: One final emotional beat: a conversation, a small action, a symbolic gesture. Something Maia could not have done in Act 1—now done with quiet conviction.

* Scene 54 - Final Image:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A mirror image of the opening scene—but now, everything is different. A quiet, haunting moment that lingers.
	- Thematic Setup: Full circle. Not a return—but a reckoning.
		- Irony: The world looks the same, but Maia is not.
		- Narrative depth: It’s not about what happened. It’s about what it meant.
	- Narrative in Action: A visual echo of the opening, now charged with new meaning. Perhaps Maia stands alone—perhaps she doesn’t. But her stillness is different now.

		- Foreshadowing: This isn’t the end of the story—it’s the beginning of something new.
	- Narrative in Action: The monster is defeated—perhaps not fully destroyed, but disarmed, scattered, or scared away. The Hero is injured—but alive.

* Scene 52:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The Hero faces the fallout—who lived, who didn’t, and what was lost. This is where the weight of survival hits.
	- Thematic Setup: The world is changed because the Hero changed. Even in stillness, the weight of transformation is present.
		- Irony: They thought survival was the goal—but survival is just the beginning.
	- Narrative in Action: Survivors emerge. The community begins to stir. There is no “return to normal”—only a new beginning.

* Scene 53:
	- Creating a Story in Action: The setting feels different now—not because it has changed, but because the Hero has. They are seeing everything through new eyes.
	- Thematic Setup:
		- Synthesis: This is the final proof of their transformation; synthesis made visible—we don’t need them to explain who they are now—we already know.
	- Narrative in Action: One final emotional beat: a conversation, a small action, a symbolic gesture. Something the Hero could not have done in Act 1—now done with quiet conviction.

* Scene 54 - Final Image:
	- Creating a Story in Action: A mirror image of the opening scene—but now, everything is different. A quiet, haunting moment that lingers.
	- Thematic Setup: Full circle. Not a return—but a reckoning.
		- Irony: The world looks the same, but the Hero is not.
		- Narrative depth: It’s not about what happened. It’s about what it meant.
	- Narrative in Action: A visual echo of the opening, now charged with new meaning. Perhaps the Hero stands alone—perhaps they don’t. But their stillness is different now.
