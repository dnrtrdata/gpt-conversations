I want to automate the process of either a) finding and collecting the subtitle file for any number of local video files (if available) as a .txt file or .srt file; or b) extract a transcript of any number of local video files using any quick, efficient free service (online) or quick, efficient llm function (local only; using my local system which contains an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop GPU with 8 GB of RAM). Then I want to remove any unnecessary empty space within every subtitle/transcript file and format them in a similar-enough format (to facilitate the free service OR local llm function to efficiently process many of these files in sequence/simultaneously) then I want the subtitle/transcripts to be processed to seek out ideas, patterns, et cetera based on my specfic (but primarily simple)

Can you find tools and develop a process to facilitate making this task possible and automate it for me, then describe instructions of how to create this workflow on my windows 11 pc?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Got it! Before I begin, could you clarify the following details to make sure the automation process meets your needs:

Subtitle Retrieval: Are the subtitles embedded in the video files, or do you want to search for external subtitles online (e.g., OpenSubtitles, Subscene)?

Transcription Service: Would you prefer an offline solution (e.g., Whisper, Vosk, faster-whisper) or are you open to using an online API (e.g., OpenAI Whisper API, Deepgram)?

Batch Processing: How many video files do you typically want to process at once, and should the script run them in parallel?

Formatting Needs: What specific format should the final output have? (e.g., plain text without timestamps, formatted like a structured transcript, etc.)

Pattern Analysis: What kind of patterns or ideas are you looking to extract from the transcripts? (e.g., keyword frequency, sentiment analysis, thematic clustering)

Once I have these details, I can provide a step-by-step process, tool recommendations, and automation workflow instructions for Windows 11.

1. Across the video files, the answer will vary. If the subtitles are embedded, I'll need a way to extract them. Many video files on my device have corresponding files that will simply need to be found and collected. If there isn't any embedded subtitles AND there is no corresponding subtitle file, then I'll need to search for external sources of subtitles for the video and I'll need the most efficient sources and tools to accomplish this function.
2. I am open to any method that doesn't add cost to the process. I need the entire process to rely on free/open-source tools to accomplish the task.
3. I am open to the most efficient method to process the files - simultaneously if my hardware can complete the task without placing a significant amount of stress on my system (I can provide comprehensive system details if that would be helpful to your task of developing this workflow and communicating how to operate it to me). I also have no problem with processing the files in-sequence. The number of video files will vary by task, but I believe in most cases, a single run-through of the workflow will contain no more than 40 video files.
4. I'd like the formatted output should best make use of storage space and be easy to read for an llm to analyze and complete the task-at-hand efficiently, but with the capability of most llm's I've used, I believe they'd be capable of using a roughly-formatted .txt, .srt, or something comparable relatively easily; I want the text to be in proper order with respect to the video's runtime, but I don't believe time-stamps would be required (with that said, if we can include timestamps for every file without significant additional steps/added-processing then I'd prefer to have time-stamps in the output format).
5. I can't adequately summarize the patterns I'd want to be searched for or analyzed and compared (etc.), but I'd relate MOSTLY to more-granular aspects of storytelling through visual mediums that the video  files would represent (films, television-series, YouYube content) and I'd try to track/compare elements throughout many videos or track characters and their change throughout a single film... I hope that gives you a sufficient idea of the sort of data I'd be trying to find and leverage in my own creative storytelling projects.

Do you need any other information from me to get started?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Thanks for the details! I'll research the best free and open-source tools to:

Extract embedded subtitles and locate existing subtitle files

Fetch external subtitles when necessary

Transcribe video files efficiently using local or online methods

Format transcripts optimally for analysis

Automate the entire process with a streamlined workflow for Windows 11

I'll also consider your hardware capabilities and include step-by-step instructions for setting everything up. I'll get back to you with the full workflow soon.

Tools and Workflow for Subtitle Extraction and Analysis
Extracting Embedded Subtitles from Videos

Tool: Use FFmpeg – a powerful open-source command-line tool – to extract subtitle tracks from video files. FFmpeg can detect and export embedded subtitles if the video container has them
trac.ffmpeg.org
. For example, running a command like:

arduino
Copy code
ffmpeg -i "input_video.mkv" -map 0:s:0 "output_subtitle.srt"


will extract the first subtitle stream as an SRT file (if one exists). This method is efficient for batch processing because FFmpeg is scriptable.

 

Alternative GUI: If you prefer a graphical interface, Subtitle Edit (free & open-source) can quickly import and save embedded subtitles. Simply drag and drop the video (e.g. an MKV) into Subtitle Edit – if it finds an embedded subtitle track, go to File → Save As... to export it as an .srt file
superuser.com
. This is an easy one-by-one method on Windows.

Locating Existing Subtitle Files

Before downloading or transcribing, check if subtitles already exist as separate files. Often, videos come with .srt or .txt files in the same folder (with the same name as the video). These “sidecar” subtitles can be detected manually (via Windows Search or file explorer) or programmatically. For instance, a simple PowerShell or Python script can list video files and check for any .srt with matching filenames. Many media players (e.g. VLC) auto-load such files, so leveraging them prevents redundant work. In the automation steps below, we will also use a tool that skips downloading if a local or embedded subtitle is present
subliminal.readthedocs.io
.

Downloading External Subtitles (When None are Available)

If no subtitles are found, you can fetch them from online databases using an open-source tool like Subliminal. Subliminal is a Python-based CLI that searches subtitle repositories (OpenSubtitles, etc.) and downloads the best match for your video. It supports multiple providers (e.g. Addic7ed, OpenSubtitles, Podnapisi)
subliminal.readthedocs.io
 and will automatically skip videos that already have subtitles (either embedded or external)
subliminal.readthedocs.io
. This means you can point it at a folder of videos and it will only download missing subtitles.

 

To use Subliminal, install it (instructions in the setup section) and then run a command such as:

nginx
Copy code
subliminal download -l en "X:\Videos\MyFolder"


This scans the folder for videos and finds English subtitles for each. You can specify languages with -l (use ISO codes) and even target a specific provider with -p if needed. Note that some providers (like OpenSubtitles) require a free account; you can pass your credentials via CLI options (e.g. --opensubtitles USER PASSWORD)
subliminal.readthedocs.io
 or configure a .subliminal.toml config file. Subliminal is efficient and supports multithreading for faster downloads of multiple files (see -w/--max-workers) to balance speed and system load.

Transcribing Video Audio to Text (Speech-to-Text)

When subtitles (embedded or online) aren’t available, the fallback is to transcribe the audio. The top choice here is OpenAI Whisper, a state-of-the-art speech recognition model that is free and open-source. Whisper can be run locally on your machine and leverages the GPU for faster-than-real-time transcription
tomshardware.com
. With your NVIDIA RTX 4070 (8GB VRAM), you can expect efficient performance – for instance, transcribing an hour of audio in much less than an hour, depending on the model size. The Whisper repository provides a CLI tool that can process audio or video files and output text. It supports multiple model sizes (smaller models are faster but less accurate; larger ones are more accurate but use more VRAM). For English videos, the medium.en or large model would maximize accuracy (8GB VRAM should handle medium or possibly large with careful settings).

 

Whisper’s CLI can directly generate subtitle files. For example:

css
Copy code
whisper "video.mp4" --model medium.en --language English --output_format srt


will produce an .srt transcription with timestamps. Whisper can also output plain text or other formats by adjusting the --output_format parameter
github.com
. Everything runs locally – no internet needed – and free of charge after setup. (Under the hood it uses PyTorch and your GPU to accelerate the AI model).

 

Alternatives: If Whisper is too resource-intensive, another open-source option is Vosk (by Alpha Cephei). Vosk is an offline speech recognition toolkit that supports many languages
github.com
 and has very lightweight models (~50 MB). It can generate transcripts or even subtitles, and interfaces with Python, Java, etc. Vosk’s accuracy for clear English speech is decent, though Whisper generally achieves better accuracy on complex audio. Still, for quicker or lower-memory transcription, Vosk is a viable choice.

 

Note: There are also user-friendly wrappers for Whisper if you prefer not to use the command line. For example, WhisperDesktop is a Windows GUI that packages Whisper in a simple app – you download an EXE and the model files, then transcribe audio with a few clicks
tomshardware.com
. This can simplify setup, though the official Whisper CLI with GPU support will be faster on high-end hardware.

Formatting Transcripts for Analysis

Whether you obtained subtitles from files or via transcription, it’s important to store them in a format that’s easy to analyze. SubRip (.srt) is a common choice as it preserves timestamps with each dialog line. If you used Whisper with --output_format srt, you already have time-stamped subtitles. SRT files are plaintext and can be read or parsed by many tools. However, if timestamps are not needed for your analysis, you might prefer a plain text format to reduce file size and complexity. Whisper and similar tools allow output to plain text (just the transcript without times)
github.com
. For example, Whisper’s --output_format txt will produce a simple text file with the full transcript in order.

 

For optimal storage and analysis:

Preserve text order: Don’t shuffle or split the transcript by scenes if you want to analyze story flow. Keep the dialogue in sequence as it is in the video.

Timestamps (optional): Including timestamps (as in SRT or VTT) can be useful if you need to correlate events with time or want to reference specific moments. They do add overhead, but tools can ignore or strip them during text processing if needed. A compromise is to store the master copy as SRT and generate a secondary plain text version for analysis. You can easily convert SRT to raw text by removing the timecodes (Subtitle Edit has an Export→Plain Text option, or you can use regex in a text editor).

File naming: Save the transcript with the same base name as the video (e.g. movie1.srt for movie1.mp4) for easy reference. This way you can trace which transcript belongs to which video when doing batch analysis.

Batch Processing Automation

To handle up to 40 video files efficiently, you’ll want to automate the above steps. A sensible pipeline is: extract embedded subs → download external subs → transcribe remaining audio → analyze transcripts. You can achieve this with either scripting or clever use of the tools’ batch features:

Using Scripts: A simple batch script (Windows .bat or PowerShell) can loop through all video files in a directory. For each file, run FFmpeg to extract subtitles, then run Subliminal to get externals, and if still no subtitle file exists, call Whisper to transcribe it. This sequential approach ensures you only transcribe when necessary, saving time. It also avoids overloading your system – each step is done one file at a time. For example, in a PowerShell script you might do:

ffmpeg -y -i "$file" -vn -an -dn -map 0:s:0 "${file%.mp4}.srt" (try to extract first subtitle stream).

If .srt not created, subliminal download -l en "$file" (download subtitle).

If still no .srt, run Whisper: whisper "$file" --model small.en --output_format srt.

This can be expanded to handle multiple languages or multiple subtitle tracks as needed.

Tool Native Batch Support: Subliminal can accept a directory of videos as input, processing all in one command (as shown above). It will use multiple threads if you allow, to download subtitles in parallel – useful when dealing with dozens of files. Whisper doesn’t natively take a folder of files in one go; you’d typically call it per file (though you could run multiple instances in parallel if GPU memory allows). It’s wise to avoid running too many Whisper processes concurrently on an 8GB GPU – one at a time is safest for large models, whereas smaller models could run two at once. If you need parallel processing for speed, consider transcribing two videos at a time with a smaller model, or use a queue system (finish one, then start the next) to balance GPU utilization.

System Efficiency: The pipeline ensures minimal wasted effort. Subtitle extraction and downloads are relatively light on CPU/GPU, so they can be done quickly or even alongside another transcription. The heavy task is transcription; doing it only for videos with no available subs cuts down processing significantly. You might run the extraction and download steps for all videos first (which can even be done in parallel threads), then have a list of which files still need transcripts and feed those to Whisper one by one. Monitor your system resources (CPU, GPU, RAM) during a test run to decide if you can overlap tasks. For instance, you could start Whisper on file1 while FFmpeg extracts subs from file2 and file3 in the background – this requires some scripting, but can reduce total time if your CPU can handle FFmpeg while GPU handles Whisper.

In summary, automation can be achieved either through custom scripting (giving you full control) or by leveraging the batch capabilities of the tools (Subliminal for multiple downloads, FFmpeg in a loop, etc.). The goal is to end up with a subtitle/transcript file for each video with minimal manual intervention.

Tools for Pattern and Thematic Analysis

With all transcripts ready, you can move on to analyzing the storytelling elements across these texts. There are several free open-source tools that cater to qualitative text analysis and can help identify patterns, themes, and trends:

QualCoder: An open-source qualitative data analysis software (GUI based). It allows you to import text (like transcripts), code/tag segments of text, and categorize themes. You can manually highlight dialogues that correspond to certain storytelling elements (e.g. exposition, conflict, resolution, recurring motifs) and assign codes. QualCoder provides an intuitive interface for this “coding” process, making it easier to manage themes. It supports exporting your coded data for further analysis. In short, users can code text data and create tags to identify themes and patterns
insight7.io
 – perfect for extracting narrative patterns from subtitles. This tool is comparable to commercial products like NVivo but completely free.

Taguette: Another open-source tool for qualitative analysis, Taguette lets you highlight portions of text and tag them with thematic labels. It’s web-based (you can run it locally) and was designed to be user-friendly for researchers. For example, you can import each transcript, then tag character names, plot points, or emotional tones. Taguette is described as a free and open-source tool for qualitative research that lets you tag and highlight quotes, then export the results
taguette.org
. This is useful if you plan on a more manual analytical approach to the storytelling content.

Automated Text Analysis: If you want to complement manual coding with automated analysis, you can use Python libraries (since you already have Python for Subliminal/Whisper) to quantitatively analyze the transcripts. For instance:

Use NLTK or spaCy to tokenize the text and find frequent words or collocations (e.g. identify the most common character names or plot-related terms).

Perform sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional tone of different parts of the story (there are open-source sentiment models that can be applied to transcripts).

Apply topic modeling (with libraries like Gensim’s LDA) to discover latent themes across the transcripts. Topic modeling can uncover hidden structures in the text, grouping words into significant themes
insight7.io
. For example, an LDA model might reveal topics like “family conflict” or “hero’s journey” based on word co-occurrence patterns, without you having to predefine those themes.

Use keyword extraction or concordance tools to find patterns. For instance, you could search all transcripts for specific phrases or motifs to see how often and where they occur.

Visualization and Additional Tools: Once you have coded themes or discovered topics, you might visualize the data. While not strictly necessary for the textual analysis itself, seeing word clouds or frequency charts can highlight patterns. Open-source tools like Voyant Tools (web-based text analysis suite) can generate word clouds, frequency lists, and keyword in context views easily (Voyant is free to use, though not an offline tool). For an offline approach, you could use Python’s matplotlib or other libraries to graph occurrences of themes over time (since each subtitle has a timestamp, you could plot where in the timeline certain keywords appear). However, keep the visualization step optional and ensure it doesn’t violate the constraint of using open-source (Voyant is free but not open-source; if needed, stick to Python visualization which is open-source).

In essence, for thematic analysis of storytelling: start with a qualitative coding tool (for in-depth, human-guided insight) and/or use NLP libraries for pattern mining. Many of these tools can work in tandem – for example, you might use automated analysis to flag potential themes, then use QualCoder/Taguette to verify and annotate those themes in context.

Setup and Operation on Windows 11 (Step-by-Step)

Finally, here’s a consolidated guide to setting everything up and running the workflow on a Windows 11 system:

Install FFmpeg: Download the Windows 64-bit FFmpeg build from the official FFmpeg site (they provide a link to Windows builds on gyan.dev)
community.gumlet.com
. Extract the ZIP (e.g., to C:\ffmpeg\), then add the C:\ffmpeg\bin folder to your PATH environment variables
community.gumlet.com
community.gumlet.com
. This lets you use the ffmpeg command in any terminal. (To verify, open Command Prompt and run ffmpeg -version, you should see version info.)

Install Subtitle Edit (optional): If you want the GUI for subtitle extraction or editing, download Subtitle Edit from its official GitHub page or via Microsoft Store. It’s a straightforward installer. No additional configuration needed – you can run it to manually inspect or extract subtitles from any video as described earlier.

Install Python 3: If not already installed, get the latest Python 3.x from python.org. Run the installer and check “Add Python to PATH”. Verify by opening PowerShell and running python --version. (This is needed for Subliminal and possibly Whisper if using the Python route.)

Install Subliminal: Open a Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and install Subliminal via pip:

nginx
Copy code
pip install subliminal


This will also install any dependencies (like babelfish for language codes). Subliminal may use a cache and config in your user directory. For OpenSubtitles, it’s wise to have an account: create a free account on OpenSubtitles.org, then you can either provide credentials each time (e.g. subliminal download -l en --opensubtitles YOURUSER YOURPASS <video>) or set up a config file. For a quick start, you can skip login – Subliminal will still try anonymous downloads or other providers, but OpenSubtitles limits might apply without login.

Install Whisper (Speech-to-Text): You have two main options:
a. Whisper via Python – In the same terminal, install OpenAI’s Whisper and PyTorch. First install PyTorch with CUDA support for your GPU. For example:

perl
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118


(This installs PyTorch with CUDA 11.8, which is suitable for RTX 40-series; you can also use the PyTorch website’s selector for the correct command.) Next, install Whisper:

nginx
Copy code
pip install openai-whisper


This provides the whisper CLI tool. Test it by running whisper --help. The first time you run a transcription, it will download the model weights (which can be large, e.g. 1.5GB for medium model), so ensure you have internet for that step. Once downloaded, transcription runs fully offline.

 

b. WhisperDesktop (GUI) – If you prefer not to mess with Python and CUDA, use WhisperDesktop. Download the latest WhisperDesktop.zip from its GitHub releases and unzip it. Inside you’ll find an EXE; launch it and it will prompt you to download a model (choose a model based on accuracy/speed trade-off, e.g. medium or large). This tool provides a simple interface to load a video/audio and transcribe it. According to a user report, “Getting WhisperDesktop running proved very easy… Just grab WhisperDesktop.zip and extract it”
tomshardware.com
, then download the model when prompted. It runs on Windows 11 without needing Python. The only drawback is slightly less GPU optimization, but it’s convenient.

Install QualCoder/Taguette (for analysis):

QualCoder: Download the Windows release from the QualCoder GitHub. It’s a Python-based app but comes with an easy installer for Windows. Launch QualCoder and you can create a new project and import your transcripts for coding.

Taguette: You can install Taguette via pip (pip install taguette) or use their desktop app. On Windows, the easier way is pip – then run taguette from PowerShell to launch the web interface locally. (It will open a localhost webpage where you can create a project and upload documents to start coding.)

Run the Workflow (batch): Now that all tools are set up, you can process your videos. Let’s outline the procedure for a batch of files:

Create a folder (say C:\VideoBatch) and place all 40 video files there (and ensure there aren’t extraneous files with same names to avoid confusion).

Open PowerShell and cd into that directory.

Step 1: Extract subtitles with FFmpeg – run:

powershell
Copy code
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem *.mp4) {
    ffmpeg -y -i $file.FullName -vn -an -dn -map 0:s:0 "$($file.BaseName).srt"
}


(Adjust the extension *.mp4 to match your videos, and you can repeat the -map for additional subtitle tracks if needed.) This loop tries to extract an SRT for each video. It will produce errors for files that have no subtitles, which you can ignore. After this, you will have .srt files for videos that had embedded subtitles.

Step 2: Download missing subtitles – run Subliminal on the whole folder:

shell
Copy code
subliminal download -l en .


This will scan the current directory (.) for all video files. For each video, if an English subtitle is already present (either as a sidecar file or embedded, which Subliminal can detect via video metadata), it will skip
subliminal.readthedocs.io
. For those without subtitles, it will search online and download the best match. After this step, check the folder – you should see new .srt files for many videos. Subliminal names the files appropriately (often appending the language code, e.g., movie1.en.srt; you can use --single option to omit language code if needed).

Step 3: Transcribe remaining videos – now handle any videos that still have no subs. Ideally, you identify those by checking which videos don’t have a corresponding .srt. You can do this manually or with a quick command (e.g., list all videos and compare to subtitle files). For each such video, run Whisper to transcribe. For example:

shell
Copy code
whisper "no_subtitle_video.mp4" --model medium.en --language English --output_format srt


Adjust model choice if you want faster (use small.en or base.en for speed with less accuracy). The output will be an SRT with the same name as the video. If you have many to transcribe, you might script this as well (similar to the FFmpeg loop, but calling whisper). It’s safest to do them one by one unless you are sure your GPU can handle parallel runs. Each transcription might take a few minutes to tens of minutes depending on length and model size – you can monitor GPU usage in Task Manager.

Verify and Organize Outputs: After these steps, every video should have either an extracted, downloaded, or transcribed subtitle file. It’s good to spot-check a few to ensure the content looks correct (open the SRT in Subtitle Edit or a text editor). You might want to normalize file naming (Subliminal might have added language codes – you can rename them to just “videoName.srt” for consistency). All transcripts are now ready for analysis. It’s wise to keep a copy of the raw SRTs as your source data.

Analyze the Transcripts: Use QualCoder or Taguette to open the transcripts and begin coding for themes. For example, in QualCoder, create a new project, import all the SRT or text files (each will be a document in the project). Then create codes for the themes or patterns you’re interested in (e.g. “Dialogue about family”, “Action scene”, “Plot twist revelation”, etc.), and go through the transcripts highlighting passages that fit those codes
insight7.io
. You can later retrieve all quotes under a code to see all instances of a theme across episodes or films. If you prefer automated analysis, you can load the transcripts into a Python script and use NLP techniques as described earlier – since everything is in text form, you have full flexibility. For instance, you could run a word frequency analysis to find the most common descriptors or use a topic modeling script to see emergent themes across the whole corpus
insight7.io
.

By following these steps, you leverage the best free and open-source tools at each stage: FFmpeg and Subtitle Edit for extraction, Subliminal for fetching online subtitles, Whisper (or alternatives) for transcription, and QualCoder/Taguette plus NLP libraries for analysis. This workflow is optimized for efficiency (only transcribing when necessary, using GPU acceleration for speech-to-text, multi-threading for downloads) and remains entirely in the open-source ecosystem. With everything set up on Windows 11, you can repeat the process for new batches easily or even automate it further. Good luck with your storytelling analysis!
