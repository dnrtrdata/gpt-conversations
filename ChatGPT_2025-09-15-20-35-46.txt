**The Conjuring** (2013) emerged as a rare horror film that pleased both critics and general moviegoers, becoming a modern horror classic in the process ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20films%20we%E2%80%99ve,personified%20through%20sincere%2C%20compassionate%20performances)) ([Notes on The Conjuring – The Sundae](https://thesundae.net/2020/11/01/notes-on-the-conjuring/#:~:text=The%20Conjuring%C2%A0was%20a%20smash%20hit,Exorcist%2C%20a%20kind%20of%20slow)). Critics praised its craftsmanship and genuinely terrifying moments, while audiences left theaters thrilled by the experience. This blend of effective scares, engaging storytelling, and positive word-of-mouth translated into huge popularity – the film earned over $319 million worldwide against a $20 million budget ([The Conjuring - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conjuring#:~:text=Box%20office)). Below, we break down what made *The Conjuring* so effective and how audiences reacted, from the scares and characters to its overall reception and financial success.

## Effective Scares and Atmosphere

Critics and fans alike agree that *The Conjuring* is **“well-crafted and gleefully creepy,” ratcheting up dread through a series of effective old-school scares ([  All Conjuring Universe Movies Ranked							 | 	Rotten Tomatoes](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/all-conjuring-universe-movies-ranked/#:~:text=Critics%20Consensus%3A%20Well,school%20scares)).** Director James Wan builds tension with a **“slow burn of rising anticipation”** rather than cheap gore ([‘The Conjuring’ Movie Review](https://www.scene-stealers.com/reviews/print-reviews/the-conjuring-is-haunted-house-horror-done-right/#:~:text=Attention%20Paranormal%20Activity%20series%3A%20This,slow%20burn%20of%20rising%20anticipation)). In fact, the film **“accomplishes all of this without a hint of slasher gore” ([‘The Conjuring’ Movie Review](https://www.scene-stealers.com/reviews/print-reviews/the-conjuring-is-haunted-house-horror-done-right/#:~:text=Attention%20Paranormal%20Activity%20series%3A%20This,slow%20burn%20of%20rising%20anticipation))**, relying on atmosphere and suspense. From the opening scenes, Wan establishes a **“sense of creeping dread”** that grips the audience ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=And%20it%20does%20become%20horrific,home%20with%20sleek%2C%20unflinching%20style)). Even the jump scares are carefully earned – **“the film’s jump scares avoid feeling cheap or calculated,”** one review noted, because the movie takes time to build genuine tension ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=And%20it%20does%20become%20horrific,home%20with%20sleek%2C%20unflinching%20style)).

- **Old-School Techniques:** Many reviewers called the film a throwback to 1970s haunted-house horror. It feels reminiscent of classics like *The Exorcist* and *Poltergeist* in its style ([The Conjuring is Overhyped : r/horror](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/pm8ym7/the_conjuring_is_overhyped/#:~:text=you%20can%20now)) ([‘The Conjuring’ Movie Review](https://www.scene-stealers.com/reviews/print-reviews/the-conjuring-is-haunted-house-horror-done-right/#:~:text=Now%20don%E2%80%99t%20get%20me%20wrong%2C,out%20at%20the%20same%20parties)). The **creepy clap-and-hide game** and eerie silence in dark hallways exemplify Wan’s use of suspense over explicit violence. One critic described it as **“a sensationally entertaining old-school freakout”** and **“one of the smartest, most viscerally effective thrillers in recent memory” ([THE CONJURING - Ecstatic Reviews Pouring In - ](https://andyfilm.com/mboard/viewtopic.php?t=4042#:~:text=%3E%20A%20sensationally%20entertaining%20old,long%20been%20one%20of%20Wan%E2%80%99s))** – meaning the scares hit on a gut level. Another called it **“taut and effective edge-of-the-seat horror, delivered with style” ([THE CONJURING - Ecstatic Reviews Pouring In - ](https://andyfilm.com/mboard/viewtopic.php?t=4042#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dreadcentral.com%2Freviews%2Fconjuring))**. 

- **Tension and Dread:** *The Conjuring* sustains tension from start to finish. Early on, small disturbances (clapping hands in empty rooms, resetting clocks) set an uneasy tone. Viewers consistently felt on edge: one Reddit user said, **“I have never been quite that genuinely terrified. I was scared and on edge the entire movie”** ([The Conjuring is genuinely horrifying. : r/horror - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1d9tshr/the_conjuring_is_genuinely_horrifying/#:~:text=Just%20finished%20The%20Conjuring%20for,on%20edge%20the%20entire%20movie)). The film **“never runs out of steam”**, escalating to a **“relentless, chilling”** climax that one reviewer called **“one of the most accomplished, tautly-staged horror set pieces”** they'd ever seen ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Conjuring%E2%80%9D%20starts%20off,set%20pieces%20I%E2%80%99ve%20ever%20seen)). By gradually increasing the intensity of each scare, the film keeps audiences in a state of dread.

- **Effective Jump Scares:** While jump scares are present, they are used judiciously and with clever timing. Wan **“plays the audience like a fiddle, paying off every scare he sets up in thrilling fashion” ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=And%20it%20does%20become%20horrific,home%20with%20sleek%2C%20unflinching%20style)).** For example, the infamous **“hide and clap”** scene builds unbearable suspense before a sudden clap in the dark makes viewers jump. Even jaded horror fans found themselves jolted; as one person admitted on Twitter, **“I screamed out loud. Which I generally don’t do in crowded theaters. For a movie like this, that counts as a standing ovation.” (['The Conjuring' Reviews: 'I Was Screaming Out Loud, Which I Generally Don't Do in Crowded Theaters' (TRAILER)](https://www.hngn.com/amp/articles/8157/20130719/conjuring-reviews-screaming-out-loud-generally-dont-crowded-theaters-trailer.htm#:~:text=TheWrap.com%20called%20,films%20he%20has%20recently%20seen))** In other words, the scares were so effective that even seasoned viewers reacted viscerally.

A big part of the film’s scare factor also comes from its **direction and cinematography**. Wan uses long takes, slow zooms, and creative camera angles to pull the audience into the haunted house. **“Every nook is shot intriguingly… slow-moving zooms and odd camera angles intensify the fear factor,”** noted *USA Today*, adding that the camera sometimes glides as if it were a ghost itself (['The Conjuring' Reviews: 'I Was Screaming Out Loud, Which I Generally Don't Do in Crowded Theaters' (TRAILER)](https://www.hngn.com/amp/articles/8157/20130719/conjuring-reviews-screaming-out-loud-generally-dont-crowded-theaters-trailer.htm#:~:text=USA%20Today%20critics%20enjoyed%20the,cinematography%20in%20this%20film)). This immersive style, combined with a moody sound design, puts viewers right in the middle of the supernatural chaos. Many audience members described *The Conjuring* as one of the scariest films they’d seen in years – **“the scariest film I’ve seen since *The Others*. The audience really responded to it. Tons of screams and nervous giggles,”** one attendee reported ([The Conjuring (Post-release) | RPF Costume and Prop Maker Community](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/the-conjuring-post-release.177865/#:~:text=donkaye%3A%20,done%20and%20effective)). That mix of screams and nervous laughter shows how the film’s scares worked: they terrified people, but in a *fun* way that had crowds yelling at the screen and then laughing in relief.

## Engaging Story and Characters

Beyond the scares, audiences were drawn in by the story and the people on screen. *The Conjuring* isn’t just a parade of shocks – it tells an actual story about a family in peril and the couple trying to help them. Reviewers have pointed out that the film’s **“secret weapon is the importance it places upon character” ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20the%20film%E2%80%99s%20scares%20are,into%20its%20most%20horrific%20territory)).** We come to care about the Perron family, the unfortunate parents and five daughters who are terrorized by the haunting. At the same time, we’re invested in Ed and Lorraine Warren, the paranormal investigators, whose warm, loving partnership gives the film an emotional center. This emphasis on character development made the horror more effective: **“Though the material is scary enough on its own, the characters are so well-drawn and their struggles so vital that you root for them to survive,”** wrote one critic ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20the%20material%20is%20scary,Conjuring%E2%80%9D%20an%20instant%20Halloween%20essential)). Because we’re attached to the people, every danger they face feels that much more tense.

**Audiences found the characters likable and relatable**, which amplified the suspense. The Warrens, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, come across as genuine and caring, not typical horror-movie caricatures. Their real-life counterparts were devout paranormal investigators, and the film portrays them with depth and respect. In fact, the Warrens’ sincere faith and loving marriage become a touching element in the story ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20the%20film%E2%80%99s%20scares%20are,into%20its%20most%20horrific%20territory)). This grounded approach made viewers care about them. One review noted that the film **“commands audiences with likeable characters, played by a captivating cast” ([A Definitive Ranking of "The Conjuring" Franchise | Horror](https://vocal.media/horror/a-definitive-ranking-of-the-conjuring-franchise#:~:text=A%20Definitive%20Ranking%20of%20,mood%20of%20the%20movie))**, and this strong ensemble makes the audience invest emotionally. Lili Taylor’s performance as Carolyn Perron (the mother) was widely praised for conveying both **“maternal warmth”** and all-consuming terror as her character becomes possessed ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20the%20film%E2%80%99s%20scares%20are,into%20its%20most%20horrific%20territory)). Overall, the acting and characterization were convincing enough that viewers could imagine themselves in the Perrons’ shoes – a nightmare scenario that felt frighteningly possible.

Critics highlighted that this focus on character elevated *The Conjuring* above typical horror fare. The film **“tells its story with sophistication and care” ([THE CONJURING - Ecstatic Reviews Pouring In - ](https://andyfilm.com/mboard/viewtopic.php?t=4042#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fwww))**, treating the haunting as a real family trauma. There’s a real sense of stakes and heart. By the end, many viewers felt genuinely relieved and happy when (spoiler!) the family is saved, which is not always the case in horror. *The Daily Texan* summed it up well: *The Conjuring* is **“an instant horror classic, with immaculately constructed scares and likeable characters personified through sincere, compassionate performances” ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20films%20we%E2%80%99ve,personified%20through%20sincere%2C%20compassionate%20performances)).** In other words, it’s scary *and* it has soul. This combination engaged audiences on multiple levels – they were not only scared, but also emotionally invested and rooting for the heroes. For a genre often criticized for one-dimensional characters, *The Conjuring* was a refreshing change that left viewers feeling satisfied with the story as well as the thrills.

It also helped that the film was marketed as **“based on a true story.”** The Warrens were real-life paranormal investigators, and the Perron haunting was one of their famous cases. The film’s tagline, **“Based on the true case files of the Warrens,”** gave some audience members an extra chill ([The Conjuring 2013 Movie Poster](https://www.horrormoviesreviewed.com/post/the-conjuring-2013-movie-poster#:~:text=waiting%20just%20beyond%20perception)). Knowing that the story had some basis in reality (however embellished) made the experience more immersive and frightening for many. As one fan noted, it **“reminded me of horror movies I grew up on… a great tribute to ’70s–’80s supernatural horror but modernized” ([The Conjuring is Overhyped : r/horror](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/pm8ym7/the_conjuring_is_overhyped/#:~:text=you%20can%20now)).** By grounding its ghost story in a 1971 setting and invoking real-world lore, *The Conjuring* engrossed viewers and made the scares hit closer to home.

## Audience Reactions and Word-of-Mouth

*The Conjuring* received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from both professional critics and general audiences, a rare feat for horror. It earned a strong **86% approval on Rotten Tomatoes** and an **A- grade from CinemaScore** surveys ([The Conjuring (2013) [1600 x 2473] : r/MoviePosterPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/75ferw/the_conjuring_2013_1600_x_2473/#:~:text=aggregator%20website%20Rotten%20Tomatoes%20reports,%28Wikipedia)) – the latter is especially noteworthy, as it was **the first horror film in years to score above a B+ with audiences ([Notes on The Conjuring – The Sundae](https://thesundae.net/2020/11/01/notes-on-the-conjuring/#:~:text=The%20Conjuring%C2%A0was%20a%20smash%20hit,Exorcist%2C%20a%20kind%20of%20slow)).** An A- CinemaScore indicates that moviegoers were extremely satisfied. Exit polls and online reactions showed that people left the theater exhilarated and eager to recommend the movie. For example, one Reddit user wrote that **“the entire theatre went nuts during the whole movie. [It was the] funnest movie (based on crowd reaction) after *Pacific Rim*.” ([Thoughts on The Conjuring? : r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ioe7p/thoughts_on_the_conjuring/#:~:text=The%20entire%20theatre%20went%20nuts,Don%27t%20go%20in%20there%20bitch))** Horror films often get loud reactions, but *The Conjuring* had a almost *party-like* atmosphere in some screenings, with audiences screaming at the screen and applauding the scares. **“Don’t go in there, bitch!”**, people yelled playfully at the characters ([Thoughts on The Conjuring? : r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ioe7p/thoughts_on_the_conjuring/#:~:text=The%20entire%20theatre%20went%20nuts,Don%27t%20go%20in%20there%20bitch)), showing how engaged they were. This kind of enthusiastic audience interaction speaks to how effective and entertaining the film was for general moviegoers.

On social media and forums, many viewers shared that they were genuinely frightened but had a great time. Tweets from early screenings were glowing: **“Extremely well-done and effective”**, **“relentlessly scary at times… a well-orchestrated piece of horror that scares and entertains” ([The Conjuring (Post-release) | RPF Costume and Prop Maker Community](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/the-conjuring-post-release.177865/#:~:text=funny%2C%20and%20insanely%20well%20directed,laff)).** Another post noted, **“The audience really responded to it. Tons of screams and nervous giggles.” ([The Conjuring (Post-release) | RPF Costume and Prop Maker Community](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/the-conjuring-post-release.177865/#:~:text=donkaye%3A%20,done%20and%20effective))** This mix of terror and enjoyment meant people were not turned off by the fear but rather found it thrilling. Critics picked up on this as well – *USA Today*’s review said the movie **“keeps the audience in a state of alarmed, but eager, anticipation” (['The Conjuring' Reviews: 'I Was Screaming Out Loud, Which I Generally Don't Do in Crowded Theaters' (TRAILER)](https://www.hngn.com/amp/articles/8157/20130719/conjuring-reviews-screaming-out-loud-generally-dont-crowded-theaters-trailer.htm#:~:text=the%20film))**. In other words, viewers were scared *and* loving it at the same time. That balance of horror and fun is a big reason why audiences felt satisfied with the experience. They got the adrenaline rush they wanted from a scary movie, without feeling grossed out or emotionally beaten down. Instead, many came out saying, *“That was scary – let’s watch it again!”*

Critically, *The Conjuring* also earned respect for being a **“classy throwback”** to older horror and for Wan’s skilled direction ([Notes on The Conjuring – The Sundae](https://thesundae.net/2020/11/01/notes-on-the-conjuring/#:~:text=of%20cinema%20audiences%20,James%C2%A0Wan%E2%80%99s%C2%A0directorial%20debut%2C%20torture%20porn%20pioneer%C2%A0Saw)). Reviewers noted its polished production values and effective restraint. *Variety* praised it as **“remarkable for being a relatively gore-free piece of mainstream craftsmanship, the work of a B-movie maestro in full command” ([THE CONJURING - Ecstatic Reviews Pouring In - ](https://andyfilm.com/mboard/viewtopic.php?t=4042#:~:text=,in%20full%20command%20of%20his)).** Even outlets that typically dismiss horror gave positive notices. This critical acclaim further validated audience opinions – people who saw it felt it lived up to the hype, and those who hadn’t seen it yet became curious. The strong reviews and high audience grades created a virtuous cycle of word-of-mouth. On horror forums, fans urged others to see it in theaters with a crowd. Some credited *The Conjuring* with **revitalizing interest in mainstream horror**, saying its success **“kicked off the horror movie renaissance we’re seeing now” ([The Conjuring is Overhyped : r/horror](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/pm8ym7/the_conjuring_is_overhyped/#:~:text=I%27d%20wager%20that%20The%20Conjuring%27s,have%20been%20since%20the%2070s))** by showing studios that audiences appreciate well-made, serious horror. 

Importantly, *The Conjuring* left its audience satisfied not just in the moment, but afterwards as well. Unlike many horror films that earn a quick scare but leave viewers unsatisfied with the plot, this film gave a fulfilling experience. By the end, the evil is banished and the family is safe, which prompted audiences to actually cheer. One Twitter reaction likened the crowd’s loud screams and claps to a form of applause (['The Conjuring' Reviews: 'I Was Screaming Out Loud, Which I Generally Don't Do in Crowded Theaters' (TRAILER)](https://www.hngn.com/amp/articles/8157/20130719/conjuring-reviews-screaming-out-loud-generally-dont-crowded-theaters-trailer.htm#:~:text=TheWrap.com%20called%20,films%20he%20has%20recently%20seen)). Additionally, the film sprinkled in just enough humor and relief (such as the investigative team’s quirky assistant or lighter moments between the Warrens) to keep the experience enjoyable without undermining the tension ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Conjuring%E2%80%9D%20starts%20off,set%20pieces%20I%E2%80%99ve%20ever%20seen)). All these factors made people feel they got their money’s worth and more. As a result, viewers enthusiastically recommended *The Conjuring* to friends, amplifying its popularity.

## Financial Success and Popularity

All of these audience reactions translated into exceptional box office success. *The Conjuring* was a **“smash hit”** from the get-go ([Notes on The Conjuring – The Sundae](https://thesundae.net/2020/11/01/notes-on-the-conjuring/#:~:text=The%20Conjuring%C2%A0was%20a%20smash%20hit,Exorcist%2C%20a%20kind%20of%20slow)). In fact, it tested so well in advance screenings that Warner Bros. moved its release from a low-profile winter slot to the summer blockbuster season ([Notes on The Conjuring – The Sundae](https://thesundae.net/2020/11/01/notes-on-the-conjuring/#:~:text=The%20Conjuring%C2%A0was%20a%20smash%20hit,Exorcist%2C%20a%20kind%20of%20slow)) – a time when big-budget films usually dominate. This confidence was rewarded. The movie opened at #1 and went on to gross about **$137 million in North America and $182 million overseas, for a worldwide total around $319–320 million ([The Conjuring - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conjuring#:~:text=Box%20office))**. That’s over 15 times its production budget, an almost unheard-of return on investment. It became one of the highest-grossing horror films ever at that time. One summary noted that *The Conjuring*’s success **“all but guarantees”** a sequel ([  All Conjuring Universe Movies Ranked							 | 	Rotten Tomatoes](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/all-conjuring-universe-movies-ranked/#:~:text=thrill%20ride%2C%20as%20Ed%20and,as%20scary%20as%20the%20original)) – and indeed, it launched an entire franchise. The film is now the inaugural entry in **“The Conjuring Universe,”** which has spawned two direct sequels and multiple spin-offs (such as *Annabelle* and *The Nun*), collectively the highest-grossing horror franchise to date ([The Conjuring (2013) was the first horror film to receive higher than a B+ CinemaScore : r/boxoffice](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/ulz3sz/the_conjuring_2013_was_the_first_horror_film_to/#:~:text=opening%20for%20an%20original%20R,highest%20grossing%20horror%20franchise%20ever)).

This financial success is directly tied to the positive reception from audiences. In the film industry, horror movies often open big but drop quickly if word-of-mouth is weak. *The Conjuring* was the opposite: it had **strong “legs” at the box office**, indicating people kept buying tickets week after week. The rare CinemaScore *A-* grade ([The Conjuring (2013) [1600 x 2473] : r/MoviePosterPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/75ferw/the_conjuring_2013_1600_x_2473/#:~:text=crafted%20and%20gleefully%20creepy%2C%20The,%28Wikipedia)) meant that audiences were enthusiastically recommending the movie, and new viewers were coming in based on that buzz. Critics’ endorsements (a Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes) also helped draw in a broader crowd beyond just horror buffs ([  All Conjuring Universe Movies Ranked							 | 	Rotten Tomatoes](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/all-conjuring-universe-movies-ranked/#:~:text=thrill%20ride%2C%20as%20Ed%20and,as%20scary%20as%20the%20original)). Essentially, *The Conjuring* became a **“must-see” horror event** of 2013. Its popularity showed that there was a big appetite for smart, scary films. Even years later, the movie’s reputation holds up – it’s frequently listed among top horror films of the 2010s, and it still scares new viewers who discover it on streaming or Blu-ray.

In summary, *The Conjuring* proved incredibly effective as a horror film by expertly balancing **fright and fun**, and by giving audiences characters and storylines they could connect with. Its scares worked on a primal level, using tension, atmosphere, and well-timed jolts to keep people jumping in their seats ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=And%20it%20does%20become%20horrific,home%20with%20sleek%2C%20unflinching%20style)). The Perron family and the Warrens engaged viewers’ emotions, making every scare more impactful because we *cared* about the outcome ([“The Conjuring” effortlessly summons scares with great characters – The Daily Texan](https://thedailytexan.com/2013/10/22/the-conjuring-effortlessly-summons-scares-with-great-characters/#:~:text=Though%20the%20material%20is%20scary,Conjuring%E2%80%9D%20an%20instant%20Halloween%20essential)). This combination left audiences feeling thoroughly satisfied – they were scared out of their wits, but also entertained and emotionally fulfilled. Critics recognized these strengths, and fans on social media raved about their theater experiences, creating a strong positive feedback loop. All these factors led to outstanding reviews, an “A” range CinemaScore, and tremendous box office success ([Notes on The Conjuring – The Sundae](https://thesundae.net/2020/11/01/notes-on-the-conjuring/#:~:text=The%20Conjuring%C2%A0was%20a%20smash%20hit,Exorcist%2C%20a%20kind%20of%20slow)) ([The Conjuring - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conjuring#:~:text=Box%20office)). *The Conjuring*’s popularity can thus be attributed to delivering what horror audiences crave (genuine scares) while also exceeding expectations in story, character, and quality.

Here’s a distilled list of actionable advice based on The Conjuring’s success, tailored for storytellers crafting their own horror screenplays:

1. Build Tension Before the Scares

Use slow-burn suspense rather than relying on constant jump scares.

Establish a creeping sense of dread through small disturbances before escalating the horror.

Pace scares strategically—give the audience time to breathe so the next scare hits harder.

2. Earn Your Jump Scares

Jump scares should feel organic and well-timed, not predictable or cheap.

Use silence and misdirection to heighten the impact.

Pay off setups—if tension is building, make sure it leads to a satisfying scare.

3. Make the Horror Feel Real

Ground the story in relatable characters and realistic stakes.

If inspired by real events or folklore, lean into that to make the horror more immersive.

A well-defined setting (e.g., a haunted house with history) enhances credibility and atmosphere.

4. Prioritize Strong Characters

Give characters depth and relationships the audience can invest in.

The more the audience cares about them, the more they’ll feel the fear when they’re in danger.

Even in horror, emotional arcs matter—character-driven horror resonates more deeply.

5. Use Classic Horror Techniques

Avoid excessive CGI; practical effects and old-school horror methods often feel scarier.

Borrow techniques from classic horror films (long takes, slow zooms, unsettling camera angles).

Sound design is crucial—silence can be as effective as an eerie score.

6. Make It Fun to Be Scared

Allow moments of relief and levity so audiences don’t get exhausted by tension.

Horror is often a communal experience—audience engagement (gasps, screams, laughter) enhances word-of-mouth.

A satisfying resolution (not necessarily a happy ending) leaves the audience feeling rewarded.

7. Market the Fear Effectively

If possible, frame the story as “based on true events” to increase intrigue.

Lean into mystery and suspense in trailers—don’t reveal all the scares.

Word-of-mouth is gold—deliver an experience people want to talk about and recommend.

By following these principles, horror storytellers can create films that scare, engage, and leave a lasting impact—just like The Conjuring did.

Here’s how you can apply The Conjuring’s successful horror techniques to literary storytelling:

1. Build Tension Before the Scares

Control the pacing—gradually introduce unsettling elements before unleashing full horror.

Use small, eerie disturbances to foreshadow the bigger scares (e.g., a clock stopping, a shadow moving in the corner).

Draw out suspense—linger on the moment before something happens to let the dread sink in.

2. Earn Your Jump Scares (or Their Literary Equivalent)

Instead of sudden loud noises, use language and rhythm to create shocks (e.g., a sentence that suddenly breaks an established pattern).

Subvert expectations—set up a scare in one place, then strike where the reader doesn’t expect.

Play with sensory details—make the reader feel the presence of something before revealing it outright.

3. Make the Horror Feel Real

Ground supernatural horror in believable characters, settings, and emotions.

Draw from real fears and folklore—readers find horror scarier when they think this could happen.

Use specific, tangible details instead of vague descriptions (e.g., the smell of rot in the cold air is more effective than a strange presence in the room).

4. Prioritize Strong Characters

Horror is more impactful when readers care about the people in danger.

Develop emotional stakes—characters should have relationships, goals, and fears beyond just surviving.

Give them agency—characters who fight back (even if they fail) are more compelling than passive victims.

5. Use Classic Horror Techniques

Show, don’t tell—let the horror unfold through sensations, actions, and atmosphere rather than exposition.

Borrow techniques from classic Gothic and psychological horror (e.g., unreliable narrators, eerie settings, creeping paranoia).

Make the environment a character—a haunted house, a cursed forest, or even an empty road at night should feel alive and menacing.

6. Make It Fun to Be Scared

Vary the emotional beats—mix horror with moments of relief, mystery, or even dark humor.

Create readable tension—make the scares uncomfortable but irresistible so readers keep turning pages.

End chapters or sections with cliffhangers that compel readers to continue.

7. Market the Fear Effectively

If writing within a horror subgenre, understand its tropes but don’t rely on clichés.

Build suspense through structure—use fragmented prose, shifting perspectives, or nonlinear storytelling to disorient readers.

Make the horror linger—leave readers with haunting images or unanswered questions that stay with them long after they’ve finished.

By integrating these techniques, you can craft horror stories that don’t just scare but immerse, engage, and deeply unsettle readers—just like The Conjuring did for moviegoers.
