If I have a large collection of text documents that are notes on a fictional story Iâ€™m writing as a screenplay, how would you clean that data to create useful information in a database?

To transform your large collection of text documents into a structured database for easy reference and analysis, follow these data cleaning and structuring steps:

1. Standardizing the Format

Ensure all documents are in a consistent format (e.g., plain text, Markdown, JSON).

Remove unnecessary HTML tags, special characters, or inconsistent whitespace.

If multiple file formats exist (e.g., Word, PDFs), convert them to a uniform format.

2. Extracting Key Elements

Since these are story notes, extract meaningful elements such as:

Characters (names, descriptions, relationships)

Scenes (scene descriptions, locations, timestamps)

Plot Points (major events, conflicts, resolutions)

Themes & Motifs

Dialogue snippets

World-building elements (maps, history, laws, etc.)

This can be done manually or with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like Named Entity Recognition (NER).

3. Structuring the Data into a Database

Convert the extracted information into a structured format such as:

Relational Database (SQL-based like MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Tables: Characters, Scenes, Themes, Plot Points, Locations, etc.

NoSQL (MongoDB, Elasticsearch)

Store full text-based notes while tagging key entities.

Example Schema (SQL Table Format):

Characters Table:

id (Primary Key)

name

role (Protagonist, Antagonist, Side Character)

description

relationships

Scenes Table:

id

scene_number

location

characters_present

summary

Plot Points Table:

id

event_name

impact_on_story

related_scenes

4. Handling Duplicates & Inconsistencies

Deduplicate character names (e.g., "John" vs. "Johnny").

Ensure scene numbering is consistent.

Check for conflicting plot points and merge/review them.

5. Making the Data Searchable

Index character names, locations, and key themes for fast retrieval.

Use full-text search for quick lookups.

Implement tagging and categorization for better navigation.

6. Automating the Process

If the dataset is large, consider automation:

Use NLP models (like spaCy or OpenAI's models) to extract key details.

Write Python scripts for cleaning, organizing, and inserting data into a database.

Would you like a Python script to help with any of these steps? Or would you like help designing the database structure further?
