I'm going to provide 3 video-transcripts and I'll ask you to make note of the tone, vernacular, depth, diction, and any/all other defining aspects of how a particular speaker, Craig Mazin, speaks in each transcript.

Here's the first transcript:
hello and welcome
my name is craig mason and this is
episode 403 of script notes
a podcast about screenwriting and things
that are interesting to screenwriters on
today's show
something we have never done before it's
just
me no guest no john
he's off visiting uh family i believe in
colorado
so it's just me today and we're gonna do
something that i've been
looking forward to doing for a long time
i'm going to be talking to you today
about
structure and character i'm kind of
giving you my whole
theory on how to write a movie i know it
sounds like a lot
and it it is a little bit of a lot it's
a talk that i've done
at the austin screenwriting film
festival a number of times i haven't
done it in a while
and i feel like their exclusive right to
it has ended so now i'm giving it to you
this is sort of my how to write a movie
but before we get into that we do have a
little bit of business to go through
uh and it's about our live show our next
live show we've talked about this before
it's going to be on the evening of
thursday june 13th
here in los angeles at the ace hotel
which is a beautiful
venue and it is a benefiting hollywood
heart we do this every year it's a great
charity
we have probably the best guest lineup
we've ever had
we have alec berg the showrunner of
silicon valley and barry
we have rob mcelhaney show runner of
it's always sunny in philadelphia
we have courtney kang writer of fresh
off the boat
and we have melissa mccarthy and ben
falcone
and by the way that's melissa mccarthy
and i'm not talking about other melissa
mccarthy and ben falcone's that you
don't know i mean the ones you know
those uh it is a it is just about the
most comedy firepower i think we can
ever assemble on one stage for the show
you're not going to want to miss it
tickets i believe are still available
but we're getting close to running out
so
take a look at the link in the show
notes and get your tickets
all right let's get into it so
when we talk about writing a script a
lot of times we're talking about
structure there are i don't know four
million books about structure
i went online and i looked for
just images based on screenplay
structure and what i saw was kind of
mind blowing
there are these long narrow lines
with little ticks on them and then
there's a pie chart
and then there's a swirly thing that
kind of looks like a snail shell
there's a triangle there's a diamond i
think there's a parallelogram and if
there's not a trapezoid maybe one of you
can get on that
all of this is designed to help you
learn how to structure a screenplay
here's the problem all of it is done
from the wrong end
all of it it's all done from the point
of view of analysis
they look at things they take them apart
and then they say look
all these pieces fit into this swirly
shape or this diamond
the issue is that's not going to help
you actually write anything
because when you write you're starting
from scratch
you're not breaking something apart
you're building something out of nothing
and when you're building something out
of nothing you need a different set of
instructions
i can think of a doctor who takes bodies
apart that's a medical examiner or
coroner that's not the doctor you want
to go to
to make a baby for instance it's just a
very different thing right
so we're going to come at it from the
point of view of making babies and your
baby is your script don't worry we're
going to keep this
safe for work so structure structure
structure structure
screenplay is structure you need to know
how to do your structure structure i'm
here to tell you
is a total trap yes screenplay is
structure but structure isn't what you
think it is structure doesn't say
this happens on this page this happens
on that page here's a pinch point here's
a stretchy point here's a midpoint
structure doesn't tell you what to do if
you follow
strict structural guidelines in all
likelihood
you will write a very well structured
bad script
structure isn't the dog it's the tail
structure is a symptom it's a symptom
of a character's relationship with a
central dramatic
argument take a moment think about that
for a second
i'll repeat it structure is a symptom
of a character's relationship with a
central dramatic argument
structure isn't something you write well
it's something that happens because
you wrote well structure is not a tool
it is a symptom
when we think of rigid structural forms
i have to tell you there's nothing
honest about them there's nothing
true about them they're synthetic
there's never been one
single great writer who created one
single great screenplay
following a structural template not one
what real writers follow are their
characters and what great writers follow
are their characters as they evolve
around a central dramatic argument that
is actually meaningful to other human
beings
let me stop for a second and tell you
that we are going to get into real
practicals but
for a bit now we're just going to talk a
little bit of philosophy
first let's consider what we call basic
structure
there's a sid field point of view you
have your three acts you're inciting
incident act break escalation magical
midpoint character shift third act low
point
and kick off to climactic action we also
have the chris vogler heroes journey
ordinary world call to action refusal of
call acceptance of call no no no
save the cat is a lot of stuff there's a
lot of what to do but where's the why
who came up with this stuff in the first
place why is it there
why are there three acts at all why is
there a low point
why do we like it when there's an
inciting incident
why do we like it when there's a low
point if we don't know why those things
are there
how are we supposed to know how to write
them
because we process the world through our
consciousness and our consciousness is
sort of a
natural storyteller all of us are
actually walking around doing this right
all the time we just don't know it we're
narrativizing our own lives
better than most who try and do it on
purpose on fade in or write or duet
or highland 2. this is the only other i
don't know any other software
right now you're sitting there you're
riding along in your car
you're being passive you are accepting
this structure talk
wondering when i'm going to get to the
practicals and i will
but later if someone asks you about this
experience you're having you will
naturally without thinking create a
story you won't have to consult
a graph or a chart or a swirly thing
you'll just tell the story
here's a story i listened to a podcast
it was on the following topics
reasonable people could agree or
disagree anyway i'm the same
that's not a very good story is it
here's another story
i was listening to a podcast and it was
okay it was sort of a little boring but
then
the person said this one thing and it
reminded me of something else i heard
once
and that tied back to this moment in my
life where something really interesting
happened
and now i'm wondering maybe if i was
wrong about that thing and i should be
doing it this way instead
huh there you go and that story
has character meaning you that story is
about you
and maybe it's about me it's about a
relationship
that we're having right now through this
podcast for better or worse
and if you were to relay the story of
this experience you might share some
parts of this that you thought were
interesting or some parts that you
thought were stupid
but you will naturally contextualize it
as such
this moment in time did or did not help
you in your desire
to change we live our lives this way but
when we sit down to write we somehow
forget
you know who never forgets actors they
have to get it because they are the
characters and we are experiencing them
as the characters
so there's that old cliche line what's
my motivation that's not a joke
believe it or not that is the key to
structure
what is the purpose of all this
storytelling that we engage in all this
narration
well narration helps us move through a
changing world
and story is about a change of state
there are three basic ways your story
changes and this applies i think to
every possible story
the first way is internal this is
whatever's going inside the character's
mind
this is the things they're thinking
they're
feeling their emotions and
this axis goes all over the place it
zigzags up and down
then there's interpersonal that's
the main relationship of your story it
has a start it has an end it usually
begins in a kind of neutral way
then depending on how your story unfolds
it can dip and then rise and then
plummet and then spike
and finally you have the external axis
that's
the narrative the plot the things that
are going on around you
and that generally is just a straight
line start to end
all of this is made up of scenes and
within scenes
we're doing something that follows the
hegelian dialectic
calm down you don't need to look it up
i'll help you out
the hegelian dialectic basically is a
way of thinking about how we formulate
ideas and thoughts and arguments
you take a thesis that's a statement
something is true
and then you apply to that an antithesis
no that's not true and here's
why those things collide and in theory
what results from that
is a new thesis called the synthesis and
that starts the whole process over again
that synthesis becomes a thesis there's
an antithesis
a new synthesis that becomes a thesis
constant changing
every scene begins with a truth
something happens inside of that scene
there is a new truth at the end
and you begin you begin and you begin
and who
is the person firing these antithesis at
these theses
you so as we go through this talk never
forget this one simple fact
at any given moment as you begin a scene
you have a situation that is involving
those three axes and you are going gonna
fire something
at at least one of them to make
something new that is all story is
but what is the glue that holds all
those changes together
what's the glue that you the creator can
use to come up with your antithesis and
get your new syntheses
and do it over and over again and that
brings us
to theme theme is otherwise known as
unity uh unity is a term that was first
used by aristotle in poetics
and this is one you actually should read
i know you're like aristotle
hegel hegelian dialect calm down it's
fine
in fact aristotle was really
a contemporary writer in his own way
poetics is an easy read
and take about 30 minutes a pretty good
bathroom book and in it you'll find a
lot of things that we hear today like
for instance
the worst kind of plot is an episodic
plot well that's pretty much true
what did he think of unity or theme well
basically theme is your central dramatic
argument some of those arguments are
interesting some of them are a little
cliche
and the quality of the argument itself
isn't necessarily related to the quality
of the script
for instance you can have a really good
screenplay built around you can't judge
a book by its cover
that's okay the theme itself doesn't
have to be mind-altering or
i don't know revolutionary it's your
execution around it that's going to be
interesting
but the important thing is that the
argument has to be an argument i think
sometimes people
misunderstand the use of theme in this
context and they think a theme for a
screenplay could be
brotherhood well no
because that's nothing to argue about
there there's no way to answer that
question
one way or the other it's just a vague
concept
but men and women can't just be friends
well that's an argument better to be
dead than a slave
life is beautiful even in the midst of
horrors if you believe you are great you
will be great
if you love someone set them free
those are arguments screenplays without
arguments feel empty and pointless
you will probably get some version of
the following note
what is this about i mean i know what
it's about
but what is it about why should this
movie exist
what is the point of all this
now it's really important to note you
probably don't want to start
with an argument that's a weird way to
begin a script usually
we think of an idea and that's fine but
when you think of the idea
the very next question you should ask is
what central dramatic argument would
fit really well with this and ideally
you're gonna think
ironically for instance let's talk about
this idea a fish has to find another
fish
who is somewhere in the ocean got it
the animators will love it water fish
cool
okay let's think of a central dramatic
argument um how about if you try hard
enough you can do anything even find a
fish
that's a bit boring isn't it how about
uh sometimes the things we're searching
for are the things that we need to be
free from well okay
that's an interesting argument i'm not
sure how it necessarily
is served or is being served by this
idea of a fish in the ocean
how about you can't find happiness out
there you have to have find it within
yourself
that could work that sort of wizard of
ozis but let's go really ironically
how about this one no matter how much
you want to hold on to the person you
love
sometimes you have to set them free well
that is pretty cliche but it is a
great central dramatic argument to pair
with
a fish needs to find another fish
because when you're looking for somebody
out there in the deep deep ocean
you the writer know that what you're
promising is they're gonna find them
and then have to let them go anyway and
that
is starting to get good all right let's
get into some practicals shall we
because this is thematic structure this
is gonna help you write your script
in thematic structure the purpose of the
story
and listen carefully now the purpose of
the story is to take a character from
ignorance of the truth of the theme
to embodiment of the theme through
action i shall repeat
the purpose of the story is to take your
main character your protagonist
from a place of ignorance of the truth
or the true side of the argument you're
making and take them all the way
to the point where they become the very
embodiment
of that argument and they do it through
action so let's talk about how we
introduce
we begin in the beginning with the
introduction of a protagonist
in an ordinary world you've probably
heard this a thousand times but why
sometimes movies don't start ordinarily
um you probably saw
mad max fury road if you didn't do so
well there's no ordinary beginning there
i mean it's crazy from the jump
ordinary doesn't mean mundane
although sometimes it can what ordinary
means here is
that the protagonist's life essentially
exemplifies their ignorance
of the theme of the argument that you
want them to believe eventually in fact
they believe
the opposite of that argument that's how
they begin
typically in the beginning of a story
your main character believes in the
opposite of the theme
and they have also achieved some kind of
stasis
there is a balance in their life in fact
their ignorance of that theme
has probably gotten them to this nice
place of stasis and balance it doesn't
mean they're happy
what it means is that without the divine
nudge of the writer god
their life could go on like this forever
it's not a perfect life it's not the
best life they could live
but it's the life they've settled for
their stasis
is acceptable imperfection if we're
going to circle back around to my
favorite fish movie
marlin can live with a resentful son as
long as he knows his son is safe
that's acceptable in perfection i get it
nemo
resents me he's angry at me he feels
stifled by me
that's okay he's alive i can keep going
this way
and then along comes you the writer
your job is to disrupt that stasis so
you
invent some sort of incident aha now we
know the point of the inciting incident
the point of the inciting incident is
not to go oh god a meteor
the point of the inciting incident is to
specifically disrupt
a character's stasis it makes the
continuation of balance
and stasis and acceptable imperfection
impossible
it destroys it and it forces a choice
on the character okay but why i'm just
gonna keep asking that question
but why but why but why why do you have
to do this to this poor character
because you are the parent and you have
a lesson to teach this person
or animal or fish your motivation is
part of your relationship to your
character
you don't write an inciting incident you
don't write
push character out of safety that gives
you no real guidance to let something
blossom what you write is an ironic
disruption of stasis ironic as in a
situation that includes contradictions
or sharp contrasts
that is and hear me out genetically
engineered
to break your character's soul you're
going to destroy them
you're a god and you're designing a
moment that will begin a transformation
for this specific character
so you have to make it intentional it
can be an explosion
or it can be the tiniest little change
but it's not something that would
disrupt
everyone's life the way it's disrupting
this person's life
you have tailored it perfectly and
terribly
for them so what's the first thing your
character wants to do when this happens
to them
well if they're like you or me they're
going to immediately try and just
get back to what they had they have to
leave
their stasis behind because you've
destroyed it but everything they're
gonna do
following that is done in service of
just trying to get it back
shrek doesn't have his swamp so he has
to go on a journey
so he can get his swamp back the point
here is that the hero has
absolutely no idea that there is a
central dramatic argument they've made
up their mind about something and their
mind has not changed
your heroes should be on some level
cowards i don't mean coward like shaking
in your boots i mean coward like i don't
want to change
i'm happy with the way things are please
just let me be
and underlying that is fear and
fear especially in your character
is the heart of empathy i feel for
characters
when i fear with them it is
vulnerability
it's what makes me connect every
protagonist fears
something imagine a man who fears
no other man he doesn't fear death he
doesn't fear pain
but ah fill in that blank but the point
is it has to be filled in you can feel
it right like well he's gonna have to
fear something because fear is our
connection
to a character and a fearful hero
should have lived their lives to avoid
the thing they're afraid of
you are taking their safety blanket away
so i want you to write your
fearful hero honestly what do they want
they want to return to what they had
they want to go backwards and believe it
or not
that is the gift that is going to drive
you through the second act
the second act oh the
thing that's so scary no
no you should be excited about it let me
take a break for a second
and say that everything i'm talking
about here is
mostly to serve the writing of what i
would call a traditional
hollywood movie that doesn't mean bad it
doesn't mean cliche it doesn't even mean
formulaic
it just means it's a traditional
narrative so
i don't know if you're looking to be a
little bit more lars volunteer about
things
i don't know how interesting or helpful
this is going to be but i'm presuming
that most of you just want to write
a general kind of movie that conforms to
a general kind of movie shape
so this is how we're going to help you
do it and the second act is the part
that i think freaks people out the most
they get scared but i think you should
be excited about pages 30 to 90 roughly
please do not quote me on those numbers
but first are you getting it have you
stopped thinking about
plot have you stopped thinking about
plot as something to jam characters into
because when you do that that's why you
run out of road in your second act
you ran out of plot because it wasn't
being generated by anything except
you but when you start thinking of your
plot
is not something that happens to your
characters but what you
are doing to your characters that's when
you can lead them from anti-theme
to theme how do we do it first
we reinforce the anti-theme that might
sound a little
counterintuitive but hear me out you've
knocked your hero out of their
acceptable
stasis they are now on the way to do
whatever they need to do to get back to
it
the hero is going to experience new
things
and i want you to think about making
those new things reinforce
her belief in an anti-theme because this
is going to make them want to get back
to the beginning even
more oh it's delicious we're creating a
torture chamber basically keep thinking
that way
imagine your hero is moving
backwards against you and you push them
forward
and they push back aha good design
moments to do this
you're going to keep forcing them
forward but you're also going to put
things in their path that make them want
to go backwards
that's tension that's exciting and more
importantly
when they do get past those things it
will be meaningful
you want to write your world to oppose
your character's desires so you're going
to
reinforce their need to get back
so let's see marlin wanders out into the
ocean
his theories the ocean is really really
dangerous
what should the first thing be maybe
let's have him meet some sharks
and actually oh you know what they're
not scary at all
oh god yes they are the ocean is in fact
way worse than he even imagined
that's what you need to do he needs to
get his son back
really really soon so he can return to
stasis
and then when you've done that
you're going to introduce an element of
doubt
something or someone lives
in a different way someone or something
in your story
is an example of the life of theme
rather than the life of anti-theme
so remember your hero believes in one
side
of the central dramatic argument it's
the wrong side
you want them to believe the other one
okay but they believe the wrong one
they need to run into someone or
something
that believes in the right side of it
this
element of doubt creates a natural
conflict with the protagonist because
of course i believe this you believe
that but it's also
attractive to them on some level because
and again really important your hero is
rational
this is a critical component of a good
hero
you are dealing with somebody that
probably lives irrationally fine but
they have to have the capacity
to see that maybe there is a better way
okay
you're living things maybe the wrong way
but you need the capacity
to see things going the right way
it is fear that separates the irrational
hero
from their rational potential and
because they're rational
when they get a glimpse of this other
way of being
they're going to realize there's value
to it through circumstance or accident
or necessity
or another character's actions these are
all things you're inventing but here's
why
the hero is going to experience a moment
of acting in harmony
with the right side of the central
dramatic
argument this could involve their own
action
or it could be something that they watch
someone else do or something they
experience passively
but this is why the magical midpoint
change occurs
see now you know why you're not just
doing it cause the book said
these things generally happen in the
middle of the movie because our hero's
belief system has been challenged
there is an element of doubt there is
not a willingness to go all the way and
believe the other side of the argument
yet
they may not even understand the other
side of the argument
there's only a question that maybe for
the first time
they have to wonder if their side of the
argument that they started with the
anti-theme maybe it doesn't explain
or solve everything
have i been living a lie that's what's
happening in the middle of a movie
so remember in finding nemo there's a
moment where
because marlon has to rescue dory from
this
field of jellyfish he invents a game she
forces him to do something that he
normally wouldn't do play
he's doing it for the old marlin reasons
of
neurosis but it's working she's
following him
and as he's doing it he gets a glimpse
of what it's like to live without fear
he gets a glimpse of what it's like to
be
carefree to not worry so much to be
well a little less conservative with
your own life and he loves it
and then what happens she gets stung
oh glorious and that gets us to this
reversal
of theme the very moment your hero
takes the bait that you put there to
think about
maybe switching sides maybe switching
sides of the argument
you need to hammer them back the other
direction
the story has to make them shrink back
to the old way
dory almost dies in the jellyfish and
why
it happened because marlon decided in a
moment out of necessity
to have fun and then forgot himself
forgot his fear and what's the price of
forgetting fear and not being vigilant
pain and tragedy the tragedy of the
beginning
is reinforced and the hero retreats once
again
it's good stuff and it means you have to
be kind of
mean sadistic really but
it turns out that these are the kinds of
things we want
out of our narrative it's the essence of
what we call dramatic reversal i'm going
to put aside the examples from pixar for
a second i'm going to talk about
somebody
real there's a guy named jose fernandez
this is a true story jose fernandez is
born in cuba
and at the age of 15 he escapes cuba
with his mother and his sister and many
others
all packed in a very small boat and
during the difficult voyage
he is awakened to the sound of someone
yelling that someone has fallen
overboard
and jose 15 years old doesn't hesitate
he dives into the choppy water to save
whoever it is
and it's only when he drags this person
back onto the boat does he realize he
has saved his own mother
wow jose fernandez grows up
and he's a hell of an athlete he goes on
to pitch
a major league baseball pitcher and he's
really good in fact he's the national
league rookie of the year
and he's an all-star his future isn't
just bright it is glorious
jose fernandez is living the american
dream and i don't know how much you know
about baseball but
ace pitchers they get paid hundreds of
millions of dollars
but at the age of 24 jose fernandez
dies he doesn't die from an illness
he doesn't die from violence he dies in
an accident
but not a car accident he dies in a
boating accident
a boating accident now
do you feel that do you feel more than
you would if i'd said he died of a blood
clot well
why i mean death is death why does this
detail the boating accident make you
feel more
because it's terribly ironic because
this is a guy who saved his own mother
from water and then he dies in water
it implies that there's a strange kind
of
order to the universe even when that
order hurts
and this is where we start to pull irony
out of drama this is essential
to your choices when you decide
how you're going to push back against
your hero how you're going to hammer
them back how you're going to punish
them
think about that pixar short lava and i
talk about pixar all the time because
it's just pure storytelling and they're
really really good at it
so he thinks he's alone he's a volcano
in the ocean he thinks he's alone and
then he discovers he's not alone
but when he discovers that he also
discovers that she's facing the wrong
way and she can't see him and he doesn't
know how to sing anymore so she doesn't
even
know he's there oh that's terrible
it's unexpected it's contradictory and
it's ironic and that's exactly what you
want to do
so consider the irony that's involved
with
marlin marlin is worried that he has
lost his son
every parent who loses a child even for
an instant in a mall is scared
but that's not enough let's talk about
what the people at pixar understood they
needed to do to this character
from the very start to punish him so
that his
journey would be that much more
impressive it's not enough to say
look you love your kid your kid is lost
you gotta go find your kid
everybody loves their kid right okay
well they go a step further they say you
know what there's no mom in the picture
mom died it's just you you're a single
dad you're the only parent
you gotta find your kid no that's not
enough
how about this how about your wife and
all of your other children
were eaten in front of you because you
couldn't protect them
and the only kid you had left out of all
that
the only memory you have of your wife
and your happy life before is one tiny
egg one kid
and that is still not enough and this is
why pixar is so amazing
because they knew that the further they
went
the more we would feel at the end it's
not enough
that he only has one kid when he looks
at that little egg
he can see that the one kid that's left
is disabled he has a bad fin
now it's enough now you have created the
perfect
circumstance for that individual you
cruel cruel god of story
now i know why he's so panicked that
that kid
is somewhere out there in the ocean when
you're designing your obstacles and your
lessons
and the glimpses of the other way and
the rewards and the punishments and the
beating back and the pushing forward
keep thinking ironically keep thinking
about surprises that twist the knife
don't just stab your characters twist
the knife in them
if someone has to face a fear make it
overwhelming to them
don't disappoint them punish them
make your characters lower their
defenses by convincing them that
everything's going to be okay
and then punch them right in the face
metaphorically
so sorry to tell you that as a writer
you are not the new testament god who
tunes water into wine you are the old
testament god who tortures joe because i
don't know
it seems like fun and when you're
wondering where to go in your story and
what to do to your character ask this
question
where is my hero on her quest between
theme and anti-theme or i guess i should
say between anti-theme and theme
and what would be the meanest thing i
could do to her right now what would be
the worst way to do the meanest thing
right now
then do it and do it and do it again
until the hero is left without
a belief at all so as the demands of the
narrative begin to overwhelm the hero
the hero begins to realize that
her limitations aren't physical but
thematic i think about marlon
i promise that i would never let
anything happen to him
but then i suppose nothing ever would
happen to him
that's what dory says and marlin knows
she's right
he knows that if all he does is
basically lock his kid up
to prevent anything bad from happening
to his kid nothing good will happen to
his kid the kid won't have a real life
so now what well
the answer is obvious right if you love
someone let them go
and i'm sure that in that point in the
movie if you asked marlon that he would
say
i suppose that's the thing that i'm
supposed to believe
but they're they can't do it
not yet in fact you're gonna want
to have a situation where they have a
chance to do it
and they fail at it in some important
way because
they don't really accept the central
dramatic argument you want for them
they've just lost the belief
in their original point of view they're
trapped between rejection of the old
and acceptance of the new they are lost
their old ways
don't work anymore the new way seems
impossible or insane
shrek doesn't want his swamp back
anymore
he wants love but he is also not willing
to do what is required
to try and get it he's trapped and this
is why they call it the low point it's
not random
it's not below point because the books
say page nine you're the low point it's
the low point because your character is
lost
and in a whole lot of trouble their goal
in the beginning which was to go
backwards to the beginning to achieve
stasis to re-achieve stasis
that goes in shambles their
anti-thematic belief
whatever that was that they clung to in
the beginning of this story
it's been exposed as a sham and the
enormity of the real goal that now faces
them
isn't possibly daunting they can't yet
accept the theme because it's too scary
when your core values are gone and when
you aren't ready to replace them with
new values
well you might as well be dead and this
is why people go to movies
so granted we love the lasers we love
the explosions we love the kaboom and we
love the sex and we love the tears but
what we need from drama
and when i say drama i mean the drama of
comedy and the drama of drama what we
need are these moments where we connect
to another person's sense of being lost
because we have all been lost
and that's why the ending is going to
work because without this
there can be no catharsis catharsis
comes from the greek word for
vomiting i'm pretty sure so just think
of
a lot of your plot as shoving really bad
food down the throat of your hero
because that's how you're going to get
to this catharsis
now i want to say that these approaches
don't help you map out a second act what
these approaches do is help you develop
your character as they move through a
narrative
and that narrative is going to impact
their relationship to theme
and when you finish that movement of
this character
interacting with story so that their
relationship to the theme is changing
from i don't believe that to
okay i don't believe what i used to
believe but i can't believe that yet
suddenly you'll be somewhere around the
end of the second act and here
is the big secret john and i have said
this many many times
there are no acts so you can't really be
scared of the second act it doesn't
exist
it's not some sort of weird wasteland
you have to get through
it's just part of one big piece there's
one
act it's called your story
and now we get to the third act sorry
end of your one act
and this is the defining moment your
character needs to face a defining
moment
and this defining moment is their worst
fear it is their greatest challenge
this is the moment that will not only
resolve the story that you're telling
but it will resolve the life of your
character
this moment will bring them to a new
stasis imbalance
remember synthesis thesis antithesis
synthesis here we are again but what are
you going to do
you have to come up with this thing this
is the difference between what i'm
saying to you now what a lot of books
say
books will say defining moment goes here
and i'm saying
yeah but how what makes it so defining
you're going to design a moment that is
going to test
your protagonist's faith in the theme
they need to go through something where
they have to prove
that they believe this new theme okay
they have to prove it
it's not enough to say okay i get it
what i used to think was wrong there's a
new way that's right
that's not enough they have to prove it
and they have to prove it in a way where
they literally
embody the point of that idea
with everything they have but before you
do that
don't you want to torture them one more
time of course you do
the relapse a nice ironic relapse
you want to tempt them right before this
big decision moment right before the
defining moment
you want to hold that safety blanket up
and say go ahead
go back to the beginning you get it the
thing you wanted
on page 15. i'm giving it to you
don't go forward don't change go back
and what do they have to do they have to
reject
that temptation you design
a machinery where they have to reject
that temptation
and then do something extraordinary
extraordinary
to embody the truth of the theme
and now you get acceptance through
action the hero
acts in accordance with the theme
specifically by doing so they prevail
they have to act so let's go back to
marlin
it's not enough for marlon to say i get
it now
i've heard the wise turtles i've seen
the way dory is
i've learned my lesson i gotta let you
live
that's not enough what pixar does is
create a perfect mechanism to tempt and
then force
action dory is captured
and nemo says to marlin i'm the only one
who can go in there and save her
and this is a great temptation this is
where
marlon has to reject the old way we're
saying go ahead you got
your kid we're giving him back to you
it's all you wanted on page 15 you just
wanted your kid here he is
get out but he has to act
in accordance with a theme so he rejects
that and he says
no go ahead son
and try and save her and that
simple decision is how he
acts in accordance with theme and it is
terrifying
and now you get one last chance to
punish him
briefly go ahead
let's see nemo coming out of that net
and let's think that he's dead
and let marlon hold him and let marlon
remember what he was like when he was in
that little egg
and let marlon kind of be okay with it
because
that's what it means to live in
accordance with theme if you say
look sometimes if you love someone you
have to let them go that's one thing
actually having to let them go is
another thing letting them go
and seeing them get hurt is yet another
but that is the ultimate acceptance of
that idea isn't it
and that's what he sees but then of
course
faith in the theme rewards and nemo's
alive
so then you get this denu mall what is
the denominator
why is it there it's not there because
we need to be
slowly let down and back out into the
movie theater lobby
it's there because we need to see the
new synthesis you have successfully
fired a billion antitheses against a
billion theses and come up with one big
grand lovely new synthesis
please show it to me so we now see that
the after story life is in harmony with
theme
and here's the deal with the first scene
and the last scene of a movie
if you remove everything from the story
except the introduction of your hero
and the last scene of your hero there
should really be only one
fundamental difference and here it is
the hero in the beginning acts in
accordance
with the anti-theme and the hero at the
end
acts in accordance with the theme
now this should all help you create your
character
when you're creating character i want
you to think of theme i want you to
imagine a character who embodies the
anti-theme
you can be subtle about this you
probably should be it generally works
better if you are
and i want you to think of your story as
a journey that guides this character
from belief
in the anti-theme to belief in theme
remember
your god angry angry god you have
created this
test that's what your story is in order
to guide your character
to a better way of living but they have
to make the choices
oh you've ever heard the worst character
is a passive character that's why
they have to make the choices or you're
making them for them
and then well it just doesn't count does
it
if you can write the story of your
character as they grow from thinking
this to the opposite of this then guess
what
you will never ask what should happen
next
ever again you'll only ask how can i
make the thing that i want to happen
next
better that's a whole other talk
maybe i'll do that one in like five
years or something
i hope that you found this interesting
it was kind of fun to do
i mean i'm not gonna do it frequently
because it's scary i mean john
really does run the show but i'm all
here
all alone but i kind of liked a chance
to at least talk to you directly about
all this stuff and i hope that you got
something out of it
um if you did great um and you can let
us know

Below is a closer look at how Craig Mazin speaks in this transcript—focusing on his tone, vernacular, depth, diction, and other defining aspects of his delivery style.

1. Tone

Conversational and Engaging
Despite addressing sometimes dense or theoretical material (e.g., Aristotle, Hegelian dialectic), Mazin maintains a friendly, direct tone that feels more like he is talking to the listener than lecturing at them. He uses phrases like “calm down,” “I’ll repeat,” or “we’re going to keep this safe for work,” which create a warm, reassuring vibe.

Lightly Comedic / Self-Deprecating
He occasionally pokes fun at himself (“I’m not talking about other Melissa McCarthys you don’t know… I mean the ones you do know”), or references the fact he’s on his own for this episode—no John to host with him—acknowledging that it feels unusual. He also humorously compares screenwriting structure to “making babies” vs. going to a coroner.

Encouraging Yet Blunt
He is motivational—telling listeners “go torture your heroes” and “you should be excited about it”—while also stressing the importance of craft in a no-nonsense manner (“You are not the New Testament God turning water into wine; you are the Old Testament God”).

Teacherly / Mentor-Like
There’s a distinct sense of a screenwriting “teacher” who enjoys clarifying big concepts. He breaks down abstract ideas (e.g., theme, central dramatic argument, Hegelian dialectic) in a calm, methodical style. This “instructor” tone is peppered with personal anecdotes and references to well-known scripts.

2. Vernacular (Word Choice and Informality)

Mix of Casual Speech and Technical Terms
He uses everyday language and colloquialisms (“stuff,” “things,” “that’s not enough,” “and by the way…”), but also deploys industry jargon (“inciting incident,” “save the cat,” “low point,” “denouement”) and academic references (Aristotle’s Poetics, Hegelian dialectic).

Frequent Use of Rhetorical Questions
Mazin often poses questions to the listener (“But why?” “What is the point of all this?” “What do they have to do?”). This conversational style draws in the audience and makes the lecture feel interactive, even though it’s a monologue.

Direct Imperatives
He regularly tells the audience what to do in their writing: “Push them forward,” “Design a moment,” “Be mean,” “You need to figure out…” These second-person commands reinforce his teacherly approach.

Sprinkling of Idiomatic / Figurative Expressions
He uses figurative language: “twist the knife,” “punch them in the face,” “torture your heroes,” “vomiting” for catharsis. These visceral metaphors give color and keep the energy up.

3. Depth and Substance

Interweaves Practical Craft Advice with Theory
He discusses fundamental storytelling concepts—theme, irony, the three “axes” of internal/interpersonal/external—while constantly connecting them to concrete examples (Finding Nemo, Shrek, Mad Max: Fury Road).

Structured Argument
Although he claims structure books are often done “from the wrong end,” he very methodically walks the listener through his own approach:

Start with stasis and anti-theme.

Introduce an inciting incident that disrupts the hero’s stasis.

Incrementally reinforce their old (wrong) belief while nudging them toward the new belief.

Hit the low point.

Force a defining moment/action that embodies theme.

Philosophical and Literary References
He references Aristotle’s Poetics, the Hegelian dialectic, and classical notions like “unity.” He doesn’t shy away from bringing in a slightly academic edge, yet translates it into practical, writer-friendly tips.

4. Diction and Phrasing

Plain-Spoken but With Dramatic Flourishes
Overall, Mazin’s word choice is simple enough to be easily understood—he’s not bogged down in an overly formal or academic style. Yet he sometimes elevates the drama with phrases like “the essence of what we call dramatic reversal” or “if you believe you are great, you will be great.”

Repetitions for Emphasis
He repeats key lines to hammer home a point (“Structure is a symptom of a character’s relationship with a central dramatic argument. I’ll repeat it…”). This rhetorical pattern underscores main ideas and helps them land.

Moments of Storytelling Cadence
When he lays out the story of José Fernández or the final act of Finding Nemo, he shifts into a more narrative pace, using deliberate setups and payoffs in his own telling.

5. Other Defining Aspects

Frequent Use of Examples
Mazin consistently grounds abstract theory in specific film examples (especially Pixar). He’s fond of Finding Nemo as a go-to reference, illustrating how a theme plays out in story beats. This not only clarifies his ideas but shows he’s a screenwriter who loves to dissect real scripts.

Warmly Self-Aware
He makes asides like, “Let me stop for a second,” or “You might be wondering,” anticipating listener reactions. He acknowledges potential cynicism or confusion, giving the sense he’s aware of the typical writer’s hang-ups.

Audience Engagement & Encourage Feedback
He calls out future contact points (“If you have an outro, send us a link…”). Even though it’s a monologue, he often mentions community involvement (“some folks have started doing recaps on the screenwriting subreddit…”).

Natural Flow
Although the monologue is structured, he speaks as if these points are occurring to him in real time—often pausing mid-sentence to elaborate or clarify with a new example. This creates an informal, intimate feel, as if you’re in the room with him during a live seminar.

Overall Characterization

In this transcript, Craig Mazin comes across as a thoughtful, conversational mentor who blends friendly warmth and casual humor with rigorous, structured advice. His approach is both analytical (discussing theme, irony, and structure in great detail) and down-to-earth (using everyday language, comedic analogies, and well-known movie examples). He foregrounds why storytelling beats matter rather than just the what and peppers in a healthy dose of motivational energy—encouraging writers to “go be a cruel god” to their characters but always explaining the deeper purpose behind such cruelty.

Very good. Add on to these notes with what you infer about the same aspects of how Craig Mazin speaks from the next transcript. Also, the next transcript contains more than one speaker, so you'll have to infer which portion of the transcript is Craig specifically. Here's the next transcript:

foreign
kill his own brother
to save her well I just watched
and today I thought that dog was going
to tear her apart because it smelled
something on her
and all I did was stand there
I couldn't
move
I couldn't think of anything to say just
oh so far
welcome back this is HBO's podcast for
the last of us I'm your host Troy Baker
and I'm joined as always by the show
owners Craig Mason hello and Neil
truckman hey Troy and today we'll be
talking through episode six titled kin
just a brief setup we're we're now three
months after the last episode it's
cold
the landscape is different we've Left
Behind the crumbling buildings of the
city and we've traded them now for the
Stark
desolation of the Wilderness let's talk
about it well we first wanted to
remind people even though it's only been
a week about how things ended
um between Henry and Sam when you end an
episode with a tragedy The Way episode 5
ends
the most important thing is that you let
the audience know that you're aware of
it and you're gonna honor it it was
important for us to say
we're remembering this and also a lot of
time has not passed it was important to
give the audience an understanding that
Joel and Ellie have been going for a
while
and so they are not still in direct
mourning over what happened there isn't
this immediate grief although of course
we will see that grief burble back up
soon we've gone from Boston to Kansas
City so geographically now where are we
in the world Wyoming but where in
Wyoming they are is still something
they're trying to figure out not a small
place no uh this is kind of similar in
the game like they knew they were
getting close but they wouldn't know
exactly where they were and this is
where we get to meet some new characters
the inimitable Graham green
um and also his wife played by Elaine
miles and Graham's character gives us
some great advice anywhere people used
to be you can't go there no more so you
haven't heard the name Tommy nope what
about the fireflies we get those in the
summer not the Bugs the people there are
Firefly people
[Laughter]
you got any advice on the best way west
yeah
go east
you never go past the river here
ever what's past the river death
we never seen who's out there but we see
the bodies they leave behind
some Infected some not
if your brother is west of the river
he's gone
the notion of these two characters
emerged out of a sense of trying to
place Joel and Ellie in a world where we
don't have GPS you can have a map but if
you have a map in the middle of the
Rocky Mountains good luck you know it's
not so simple and when you're looking
for one man in a massive State it's
pretty easy to get lost as Ellie says we
must have missed all the traffic signs
and the enormous [Â __Â ] forest and we
had this notion that there is danger
ahead that is unseen and and poorly
understood somewhere out there there are
bad people ghosts monsters who knows
what but this isn't as simple as we're
just gonna walk for a while
that there's a real Danger
and there's also a as we often do in
this show a sense that every time we
meet a couple whether they're brothers
or husband and wife
there are echoes of Joel and Ellie
inside of it these two have been alone
and isolated forever uh there's no one
else in their lives and it's not like
they're saying please wait don't go
please stay play Scrabble with us this
is how it is for them you can end up in
this world just alone how effective do
you think they were by this world my
understanding of them is that
they left before well before the
outbreak ever started when the world
ended they they were already off the
grid so they have cordoned themselves
off permanently from everything and even
more so by their concern about the
things they've seen they've reduced
their world down to this cabin and a
certain amount of area they can go but
you don't go west of the river what's
interesting I think for fans of the game
especially part two is it shows you can
survive if you find like a quiet corner
there are still safe areas it's not just
all doom and gloom and danger like
around every corner it does exist but
you can survive there on your own I
think there's also
we would talk a lot about not exhausting
our audience and we just traumatized
them with the end of the last episode so
this was a moment of levity a moment to
show how Joel and Ellie have progressed
in their relationship they're much more
comfortable with each other and a lot of
our conversation about this episode were
like what is the impact on Joel
from the experience of Henry and Sam and
you get to see some of that as they exit
the cabin and he seizes his chest so
what is going on there what's happening
is Joel's having a panic attack and he
doesn't know why panic attacks feel very
much like heart attacks it's your body
telling you you're in terrible danger
but you don't understand yet why
and so much of what this episode is
about is Joel coming to terms with how
terrified he is suddenly that she's
going to die and it's going to be his
fault
and if you've been paying attention
along the way what you will see is for
as many times as Joel has helped her
he's also failed her and those are the
things that he dwells on like a lot of
us if you have core shame or core trauma
the way Joel does the things that you do
well are discounted your failures
anything that reminds you of the tragedy
of your past you will magnify in your
mind and your heart until it threatens
to subsume you he's convincing himself
that what's best for Ellie is to Let Her
Go and it's really to protect himself
and when you're playing the game you
know the camera's quite far back you
swing it around the character so there's
no way to like see a lot of what's going
on with the character's face so a lot of
it has to be conveyed with dialogue so
the way we did it in the game as I'm
sure you remember Troy we just made him
that much more distance like it's almost
like the relationship has gone backwards
here again because we could have these
like intimate moments with the cameras
right up there on your face we could do
it in much more subtle ways and I also
love Ellie's reaction here yeah which is
you know when you look at your parents
that have been protecting your entire
life you don't want to accept that they
have any sort of weakness so she's
getting angry with him which I felt this
as well you know sometimes my parents
get older I was like I don't know why
that's the reaction but you get angry
that they're not Invincible yeah if you
die I'm [Â __Â ]
is what she says to him which is I think
a very child thing to say obviously she
also cannot process what that would
emotionally be like neither one of them
are operating on on the level of
emotional honesty or acceptance yet
because they can't get there what they
are doing is doing what Joel and Ellie
do Ellie is coming at this from the
point of view of being this child who's
saying don't die because I need you to
stay alive she's certainly like I say
don't die because I love you and Joel is
not saying I'm terrified that I'm gonna
get you killed and that's why I'm so
upset instead he's his heart is seizing
up on him and he can't even explain why
it's the cold yeah he says it's just the
cold air it's the cold air so after Joel
has this
episode this panic attack we then
transition into
Ellie's staring up
at the Aurora Borealis by the campfire
and she's talking about this is the
first time we've really seen her become
wistful and maybe even hopeful yeah she
talks about her desire to be an
astronaut
it's probably because I grew up at the
cuisine behind you this ocean and ahead
of you there's a wall
or else to look what up
I read everything I could in the school
library McNeil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin Jim
Lovell do you know who my favorite is
Sally Ride Sally [Â __Â ] ride
best astronaut name ever
where did that come from when I first
started working with Neil on this
adaptation it was before the last of us
two had come out and I went over to it's
the first time I'd ever gone over to
naughty dog and sat with him there and
he said you want to see something from
the second game and I was like yeah
and he showed me a sequence from the
second game that touches on Ellie's you
know interest and fascination with being
an astronaut in space travel and it's an
incredibly beautiful moment and that's
one of those times where I said hey we
have this opportunity that Neil didn't
have when he was making the first game
which is we know more now
it was also a moment to show that Joel
knew Ellie because she says but you know
my favorite astronaut
and he says Sally Ride he knows even if
Joel doesn't know why Sally Ride means
so much to Ellie and even if Ellie
doesn't know why Sally Ride means so
much to Ellie instinctively he's already
in her head he knows this kid and she's
not shocked by this either
she's not like whoa how'd you figure
that out she's like that's right Sally
[Â __Â ] ride best astronaut name ever to
go even further back and talk about the
origins of uh why Ellie likes space so
much you know these things are massive
collaborations and everybody puts a part
of them into this thing and over the
course of making the game I've gotten to
know you Troy and Ashley Johnson who
played Ellie and Ashley loves space and
astronauts and knows everything about it
and I'm like I want to make Ellie even
more like Ashley yeah and likewise Joel
or Troy I should say I knew your start
was with music and you play the guitar
and you sing and that's why Joel says I
would have wanted to be a musician a
singer
yeah there's just something I get a
little emotional about this but like
we've all put like so much of ourselves
in this and the combination of all that
makes for something greater
Joel doesn't admit that he wants to be a
singer first he says he wants to be
a shepherd He wants to have a sheep
Ranch which is also a bit of oh yeah
people know part two it's a
foreshadowing for word absolutely that's
foreshadowing as well is this the truth
for him or is he again reaffirming the
distance that he feels I think that
there's something about it that appeals
to Joel intellectually he's a country
boy to some extent
and so I think the idea of of isolation
and peace I mean Shepherd is essentially
equivalent to peacefulness
um I think he likes that idea
intellectually but is he being honest
here no
I think the honest truth is that if he
could do anything or be anything
he would be a dad raising his daughter
whether it's Sarah or he can't quite get
there yet to say it's Ellie but that's
what he was put on the earth to do
that's why he's been wandering around a
little bit like a zombie himself for 20
years
trying to find his purpose because it
was taken from him but it's also
interesting where is his mind at right
and it's like he would like to be at a
place where he would just be alone
because that's that would be the easiest
way for him to survive right no threat
to his heart nobody that he could lose
nobody to have to look after yeah what's
interesting is that even as we show
these
moments of peace and happiness we keep
seeding these other little underlying
threads of failure so for instance Joel
says you know what I'm going to take
both watches tonight you go ahead and
sleep dream of sheep ranches on the moon
and then he falls asleep he fails
and she's the one who is looking after
him which is only
reinforcing his growing Panic that he is
insufficient that he is not going to be
able to keep her alive so even as there
the two of them are moving through this
beautiful world and seem relatively safe
he on the other hand keeps feeling the
pounding threat of his own inability to
keep her alive what's interesting there
as well is like Elias slowly becoming
not necessarily Joel but her idea of
Joel right which again she believes is
this invincible man that
can never get hurt
we move into one another one of those
moments of threats and failure
as we're surrounded by this group
who has a dog
last chance for a bullet
for in fact that he will smell it and he
will rip you up
and we know that Ellie shows up as
infected if you scan her that goes all
the way back to the first episode so now
the two of them
they can't say it out loud but they are
both incredibly aware that she's in a
lot of trouble if the dog smells the
infection on her which it probably will
it's going to kill her
they've dropped their guns they are
surrounded Joel has no idea what to do
and he chokes it is only because
whatever is going on in Ellie isn't the
kind of thing that a dog would smell but
maybe just a scanner would pick up that
she's saved the truth is there is
nothing Joel can do there what is he
supposed to do but that's rational
thought if you're a parent you do
something you you basically you go down
with the ship and he doesn't he freezes
and if you suffer the trauma that Joel
suffered and you are put right back in
that situation the fact that your brain
and body shut down should not be a
surprise at all
Joel says I'm looking for my brother and
they say what's your name he says Joel
and we smash cut to now we are just
outside the gates
of Jackson yeah so we find out that
Maria who is one of the leaders of this
settlement in Jackson she has a
relationship with Tommy which we find
out his husband and wife and that means
she knows exactly who Joel is Tommy's
told her but there's a massive
difference here from the game that we
can talk about absolutely which uh we're
in Jackson yeah in the game all the
interaction with Tommy interaction with
Maria everything happens in the dam
they're there fixing the damn for
Jackson and last was part one we never
go into Jackson and that was mostly a
time and budget issue that we actually
had all this concept art for like going
inside and we just didn't have the
resources to pull it off so when we
started talking about the sequence we're
like oh we could just see the damn but
it's actually way more interesting to go
into Jackson itself and see what's at
stake here's where you could settle down
and actually live
semi-normal life one of the other
differences is
the version that's in the game is is
when there's this opening of the gates
and Tommy comes out and there's this
moment of hesitation between the two of
them and then Tommy Embraces him here we
see a completely different version as
soon as he spots on the [Â __Â ] he jumps
off and he yells with this brotherly
desperation
Tommy
they're drawn to each other they're
powerfully but give them enough time
right and then
then the resentment returns they'll go
right back to it doesn't even take a day
because even Joel laughs about he's like
what are you doing he's like I'm here to
save you I mean how funny is that right
I can't believe this and then what
happens off camera goes what happened to
you goes what happened to you right when
they sit down to eat after they get a
tour of the place yeah there's some
really nice stuff that's happening there
Ellie's just like has a sailor mouth and
uh you know Joel being like a
a good old Texan is like apologizing
apology for her manners what
what's wrong with you what about her
manners she was just curious
kids around here don't usually look or
talk like you right
well maybe I'll teach them
and I want my gun back
they also aren't armed
you know what uh
I think maybe y'all got a little off on
the wrong foot who's gonna have her guys
kill us well you got to be real careful
about who we let in this place but then
you know when he starts getting this
pushback from Maria all of a sudden he's
like he gets very protective of his
tribe his family he's like and he's
trying to push her out and then
realizing no no this is someone Tommy
has led into the circle without his
permission so he has just a weird kind
of reaction to it and then there's like
a nice kind of um
what you call an Easter egg I don't know
if I'd call it an Easter it's a little I
mean it's ambiguous somebody's staring
at Ellie yeah I wonder who that could be
theoretically or not we'll find out here
one day I completely missed that what
are you looking at yeah because in part
two yeah there is a story about the
first time Dina met Ellie that is very
similar to what happens here that
doesn't mean that that's Dina it doesn't
mean it's not how interesting I was what
because the question that I was gonna
ask is why is Ellie being so
confrontational here well Ellie's tribe
is Joel
and Ellie has been taking a little bit
of the of the lead ever since they've
gotten to Wyoming and what she knows is
they were captured by these people guns
were pointed at them they were
threatened with dogs
and supposedly they're killing people
because Marlon and Florence told them
so she's not happy I think Ellie can
smell what's happening here which is
there's there's something going on with
Maria where she doesn't like Joel yes
Ellie consensus yes she knows when Maria
says you know bad reputation doesn't
mean you're bad or Tommy says that and
Maria says not always at least
that's when Joel realizes but Ellie got
it the first bounce we should say this
episode was directed by yazmil's bonich
who is a brilliant Bosnian filmmaker she
made this wonderful movie called kovada
saita and yazmila grew up in Sarajevo in
the middle of the war wow and when we
were talking to her about directing an
episode I said look we have these two
episodes that take place in war-torn
Kansas City it's a city that has been
divided it is essentially erupted into a
civil war
Who would know how to better do this
than you and she said I have no interest
in that because she said I want to do
this episode because what she was
interested in was showing a society that
actually functioned so the tour that
happens as Maria takes Joel and Ellie
around and shows them this place and
Ellie says this place really actually
[Â __Â ] works
that is what yazmilla really grabbed on
to is the idea that you can still have a
functioning society and Maria is the key
one of the things that Tommy says to
Joel when they're having this argument
in the bar
is
I know that you and I killed people we
did it because it was the only way we
knew how to survive but it turns out
there were other ways it just weren't
any good at them so there's this method
of surviving that doesn't involve
killing innocent people that doesn't
involve violence at all which is where
Tommy's instincts lie right and we see
it on episode one in episode one these
two characters show you who they are
Tommy wants to stop and help that family
because Joel says no keep driving
exactly and it's Tommy who joins the
Army because he wants to try and spread
democracy whatever they told him at the
recruiting office he joins the fireflies
Joel never joined the fireflies Joel
would never join the fireflies he blames
Marlene for taking Tommy from him but
Tommy has always been looking for a way
to make things better since Joel has
been controlling him yeah and this
notion that Maria has a better way of
survival is really interesting one and
it's something that yazmil really
throughout of this episode and really I
think fascinating way even to the point
where Ellie can't help but be impressed
Joel however is jealous we get the real
version of that conversation once
they're in the bar yeah he's like you
haven't aged a bit he goes you on the
other hand yeah and that's what you're
talking about the return of the
resentment there is this
thing happening in that scene
that is about lying
I'm a big believer that people are liars
not because we're mean evil but we lie
to protect ourselves
and Joel still doesn't have full access
I think to his own feelings about Ellie
what he's doing is saying we're going to
go take care of this ourselves me and
you but really what he's saying is
I can't do it alone but he's not allowed
to say that out loud he's not allowed to
say I'm insufficient I'm going to get
her killed all he can say In This Moment
is the two of us should do it and and
why can't you do it and then that
immediately turns into this
recrimination well because your wife
won't let you no she's the one who kept
you off the radio
is that why you stop messaging me back
after I ditched the fireflies Marie and
her crew found me
they're good people
they didn't have to take me in but they
did and all they asked is that I follow
their rules I'm your brother yeah I'm
aware
your wife kept you off the radio your
wife kept you from me he won't say like
it was you right like he's trying to
find blame outside of his tribe outside
of this little circle he's trying to
protect and then Tommy reveals why he's
so reluctant to go Ray is a few months
long now
so I just got to be more careful
it's not like Tommy could know although
he kind of does know that this is the
worst possible thing at the worst
possible time to say to Joel
because
it means I'm gonna get to do the thing
that was stolen from you the only thing
you ever wanted to do I'm doing it now
Joel literally I think does the best he
can do there he doesn't walk out he
doesn't punch his brother in the face he
just says well I guess we'll see how it
goes
and obviously
Tommy doesn't take kindly to that and
and says the one thing that he shouldn't
say just because life stopped for you
it doesn't mean it has to stop for me
the scene you're talking about is
interrupted in the game by gameplay yep
here obviously that's
you don't have that advantage that
convenient Interruption of like let's
get you back on the stick one could
argue a disadvantage a disadvantage yeah
so that's that's my question is like how
much does that affect the story knowing
we are not going to have infected that
are now attacking because you are within
the safety of Jackson so how does that
affect it means you have to go deeper
into the emotional action
and so what happens right after he walks
out of this bar
is something even worse
and this one gets me every time
he's having another panic attack his
hand goes to his chest he can't breathe
he doesn't know why and then he looks up
and he sees a woman that might as well
be his daughter I mean one of the things
about Nico is she has the greatest head
of hair Nico Parker who of course plays
Sarah yeah and it's very specific you
know when you see it and here's this
other
woman a grown woman but he's looking at
her from behind she's got that hair and
it's and and this this wonderful thing
that Pedro does he's blinking a lot
which we do and we're under stress we
tend to Blink a lot and so he's having
this panic attack and his eyes are
blinking and then he looks and he sees
this woman and he stops blinking and he
just stares and he stops having a pan
attack he goes into something else he's
daydreaming yeah he knows it's not her
but it could be her and then this little
girl runs over and it's like and that
could be my granddaughter yeah that's
another life and then the woman turns
and it's not Sarah
and suddenly he feels like the biggest
idiot like the most hopeless
fool that this is what he's still doing
after 20 years this is the moment where
I think
there is a snap in him a break that will
allow him finally to just tell his
brother the truth
there is a particular cue from the
scorer by our composer Gustavo santolaya
called all gone that's repeated quite
often throughout both the game and the
series and whenever it comes on I think
about loss and it all starts with Sarah
I think beautiful scores and scores that
are used well it's a way into the
subconscious so it's a way to trigger
certain memories or feelings without
being explicit about it so that's where
like in the game and similar in the show
we use that theme again to hark back to
that moment when he lost his daughter
and it's a way to tap into that yeah and
Nico did such a good job I would tell
Nico you are the point upon which this
whole thing is built it's you and your
deaf
that when Joel is looking at this woman
and we hear that theme
we feel it we feel the loss I feel it
every time I I understand Joel in this
moment I'm not watching somebody feel
something I'm feeling something with
them because I get it speaking to their
history that there's a totem of the
honoring of that on the mantle when
Ellie walks into the house and we see
this chalkboard with distressed chalk so
it's been there for a while that has two
names and two dates we see Kevin and
Sarah and I noticed something and that's
a nitpick but I was just curious the
date
that Sarah died is the 27th historically
we know outbreak day was the 26th I'm
curious after midnight it's after
midnight Yep this was a fun scene in
that you don't get to see it in the game
yeah right in the game it's like Ellie
and Joel Parkway so Joel can have a
conversation with Tommy Ellie goes with
Maria so she can feed her and take care
of her and then you just see the
aftermath of that conversation where
like somehow Ellie learned about Joel's
daughter yeah and here we got to
brainstorm and flesh that out and I
think where we ended up was really cool
there was something that we wanted to
take advantage of which was
the idea that for a moment here we could
see Ellie with a maternal figure again
we had seen it briefly with tests and
now we're with Maria first of all Maria
supplies her with new clothing she
supplies her with this the diva cup
because
half of our planet is women these shows
never talk about menstruation which is a
huge thing you're gonna have to deal
with in the apocalypse this is the
second time we've come around on it Joel
has no interest in helping out on that
front but here Marie has been thinking
about it already
and it is connected also to Sisterhood
and Womanhood and Maria is giving her a
haircut
look I'm not going to ask you what
you're doing with him good but there are
clearly things you don't know about Joe
oh like how he used to kill people I
know about that
so then you understand my concern he
doesn't do that anymore he stopped
killing people
once and Tommy did it too are you
worried about him
Tommy was following Joel the way you are
now well maybe I'm smarter than Tommy no
offense
you are definitely smart would have made
a hell of a lawyer
there's a whole lot you're not telling
me
good
therein lies the point
be careful who you put your faith in
the only people who can betray us are
the ones we trust
she's not challenging Ellie because
Ellie has a sailor's mouth or Ellie's
angry she's worried about Ellie yeah she
has nothing invested in Elliot all she
just met her but she's worried about
Joel and the way he is and that makes
her worry about Ellie and the the nice
thing about these two characters is
they're both extremely smart like now
Ellie is like being challenged by
someone that's as smart as she is and
who sees it and I think Maria is
impressed
because Joel's intelligence isn't
necessarily expressed verbally
but Ellie's is and so is Maria's and so
this is a little bit I I remember saying
to routina Wesley who plays Maria and
Bella
this is a fight this is a fist fight
yeah we're just not punching each other
and we're gonna shake hands at the end
of it but that's what's happening here
it's a fight and like earlier talking
about like is there a temptation to have
more action this is our actions yeah
this is right here like these emotional
action they're like and we're gonna have
more like later on but to me this is as
captivating
as the cul-de-sac beat in the previous
episode but we also get to see how loyal
Ellie is because what does she do she
defends Joel all the way to the end
including insulting Maria and her
husband uh all to justify who Joel is
because this is her dad but there has to
be I think a little bit of a note a
little thread inside Ellie that's shaken
when Maria says be careful in whom you
put your trust
people who trust the only ones who can
betray us
inside it's hard for Ellie to deny the
absolute truth of that
and there is something weird in the air
here in Jackson and it happens right
away when they enter Jackson and Ellie
watches Joel run over to his brother
there's you can see in jealousy in her
or a fear wait he's mine yeah that one
is mine and it's again Ellie's smarter
than she realizes she has probably
already sent something since to Henry
and Sam moment something is off
then we see Maria bring Ellie to go see
a movie with the rest of the town and
the movie is a 1977 classic Goodbye Girl
goodbye girl with Richard Dreyfus deep
cut I've never seen it really tell me
why you chose this movie and why I
should see it well I saw this movie when
I was a kid and I loved it and I think
maybe it was because it wasn't just
about a man and a woman falling in love
there was a kid
and the kid was saying that would be a
good dad that was the real love story
this scene that we show when they're
watching the movie is really the first
real meeting between this man and this
little girl and I like the idea of
movies
as an additional signifier of how
civilized this place was
because up until this point
the world revolves around ammunition
guns food food batteries transportation
and the only other person that was
invested in art was Frank
and I like the idea that one of the
signifiers that this town is functioning
is that it is still interested in art
and the community gathering together to
watch a movie which in the game right
there they're on the outskirts of
Jackson and Tommy says they'll be
watching movies tonight exactly and here
we get to see it in stark contrast to
that Joel could have been in there
watching the movie as well but what he
decided to do instead was go off and
kind of like a dad put himself in a shed
and Tool around isolate isolate
self-isolated can't face his brother he
can't face Maria he definitely can't
face Ellie right now
he has come to grips finally with the
reality that he isn't good enough and he
says it in a very compelling way you
think I can still handle things but
I'm not who it was
a week
lately there are these moments where the
fear comes up out of nowhere
my heart
feels like it stopped
and he says I'm failing in my sleep and
that was that that was uh obviously a
hard
monologue to write but the line when he
says I have dreams what dreams I don't
know all I know is that when I wake up I
know I've lost something that was from
Pedro directly that notion that when you
wake up you've you just have a feeling
that you've lost something
it was so beautiful
and it's so confessional and this is not
at all like something we saw from Joel
in the game this is different this is
this is sadder I think it's a little
more broken down and it's a little more
upsetting yeah in the game Tommy comes
to the realization when he sees how much
Joel cares for Ellie yeah after an
action sequence yeah
here it's like Joel has to plead because
it has to like
show it's the most vulnerable we've seen
him yet yep this is a difference of the
stoic play it close to the vest Joel
that we've seen
what excited you what scared you about
showing this version of Joel there was
no fear we talked about it quite a bit
beforehand
so I was excited to see the execution of
it more than anything because I knew it
would give us more insight into who this
character is and what drives him and
what scares him
I think I'm mostly concerned with not
boring people yeah so if you can
interest people in a quiet discussion
between two humans then that sometimes
is as impactful if not more so than a
big action sequence this episode in
particular
has really only one action sequence and
it's pretty and it's short it's short
and it's at the end this episode is
about other stuff all the action is
emotional action and if you qualify
emotional action as being as impactful
as physical action this is one of our
most action-packed episodes because a
lot of emotional Crossroads meet here
so Joel started this journey looking for
his brother he was terrified that his
brother was in trouble he's going to
find his brother Joel started this
journey saying to Ellie you're not
family your cargo she's family now and
he doesn't know what to do about it
Ellie started this journey looking up to
tests and thinking that that was the
person that was going to lead her to the
promised land well now Joel has become
her father figure but she is starting to
doubt whether or not she herself will
even be effective as the Hope For
Humanity
all of these things are coming together
and to me that's as exciting to watch
and certainly is exciting to write as
action for the game as well it was kind
of a similar thing of you know we made
what we call a character action
adventure game but this episode has one
of the most memorable moments from the
game which has no action quote unquote
which is the moment where Ellie
confronts Joel about wanting to leave
her
you'll be way better off with Tommy
he knows the area better than I do you
give a [Â __Â ] about me or not of course I
do then what are you so afraid of
I'm not her you know
Maria told me about Sarah and no
don't say another word
let's talk about that scene this is one
of those moments that I have sensed
memory of you know playing the game and
just being shocked this is a spot where
I mean even in an episode where we are
in Jackson which wasn't in the game and
Joel has said a lot of very different
things to Tommy that we're in in the
game this is one of those moments where
I said I want to with rare exception
we're doing the scene because the scene
is great
I want the wallpaper to be the same I
want her sitting where she was sitting I
want her reading the diary and I want to
feel all of it I think with two
exceptions one at the end where he says
you know come Dawn and then one that I'm
sure you want to ask about which is
mighty thin ice
um it's the same scene and for people
who are fans of the game there is a what
would be considered an iconic line that
I'd love to know the story of because it
was a carefully preserved thing
people who know are going to be like why
isn't that line in there I can answer
that because it's this journal is a
little bit different his dialect is a
little bit different
if that line stayed in there I think it
would have stood out in a way that would
have taken away from this version of
this scene well when we originally did
it I don't know if you know this or not
but it wasn't Mighty thin ice it was
your treading on thin ice well the other
thing I guess that again I have to give
credit is uh the scene wasn't written
with that shove no we were struggling to
get the emotion out of that scene and I
remember we had to like we tried it a
few times and like let's take a break I
think you you asked can we take five I'm
like let's take 15. yeah and then we
came back and did it and then Ashley
just on her own shoved you across the
stage and that was the take
the don't in Pedro's and what it was it
wasn't a threat again yeah he's pleading
it's almost the same please don't that
he gave to the sniper it's the exact
same thing please don't and the scene
doesn't change the subtext of you're
treading on Mighty thin ice and don't
don't say another word the context is
exactly the same
stop in your tracks turn around go back
and in both scenes
Ellie does not Ellie moves forward
physically moves forward and if I'm not
mistaken also everyone has left me
except for you it was the original line
[Â __Â ] except for you and what I love
about that is the imperfection of it
that's not where the word [Â __Â ]
belongs normally syntactically which
shows you that Ashley was just in the
moment right because we are not perfect
when we speak if I'd written that line
and looked at it I'd be like ah that
moved it around of course exactly you
would never write it like that but it's
perfect the way it is so that was
perfectly replicable and it was
important to me that we do it
everybody I have cared for
has either died or
[Â __Â ] except for you
so don't tell me that I'd be safe with
somebody else because the truth is I
would just be more scared
I guess for me as someone that obviously
has a lot of attachment to that scene I
was like
it's equally moving it's like you're
looking into another dimension right
that's the best way I can describe it
what I would say to our fans is like
don't do the comparison thing because I
appreciate it for what it is it's like
another group of artists taking a crack
at it and creating something beautiful
you're right
you're not my daughter
I'm not sure as hell ain't your dad
for me in that moment then that
performance what I got is I am rejecting
the dream the ideal but once again he is
lying yeah he's lying he it is
technically correct he wants it to be
true he feels like if I just say that
and walk away I have saved myself from
Pain and despair but it's too late it's
too late and the fact that he thinks
about his own daughter right after that
is not and that is my real daughter
therefore I've made the right decision
it's more like I have the same feeling
right I can't walk away I can't he tries
next morning he tries and he just can't
do it and what he says to Ellie is you
deserve a choice now that's a cop-out
right that's it by the way in democracy
yeah and is a noble gesture yeah which
by the way I don't know how to say this
without spoiling something but it's like
that line specific is very interesting
to where the story goes yes I agree it
is it will Echo back later on the notion
of choice but it here is a lie he's not
there because he has a choice he's not
doing her a favor he's doing himself a
favor he can't leave he can't he cannot
do it and what I love is how Ellie
doesn't even give him a chance to
continue she's just like good thank you
here we go we're back she doesn't need
him to apologize it's really good she
doesn't need to explain himself she
doesn't care she doesn't care why he
said those terrible things to her the
night before all she cares about is she
got Joel back that's all she wanted
there's something about this
goodbye between Tommy and Joel
and there's a long Embrace and and one
could almost interpret it as final but
then
we have Tommy's offer there's a place
here for you which again is that one
last chance and Joel's response that he
didn't catch the first time
I'm counting on it yeah
to me shows that there is hope and that
they will make it back from what he
calls a suicide mission and the request
can I borrow the rifle not can I have it
right but can I borrow it for what is
what does that moment mean to both of
you again it's the fantasy we all have
of like okay we're gonna all be fine
we're gonna all end up well and healthy
and we're gonna come back here and it's
all going to turn out okay do you feel
this is a that Joel looks at this as a
fresh start I think that he sees
that Tommy's figured it out Tommy was
looking for something a way to make the
world better and he did
this place [Â __Â ] works as Ellie said
he's changed he's accepted his role now
yeah he can come back here with Ellie
yeah and they're going to live in that
house and she's going to watch movies
and eat bacon
and it's gonna be okay he has to do one
last thing
and he won't fail this time
and once he has succeeded
he gets to have the life he deserves and
he gets to reclaim his purpose
in a place that works I guess it's also
the first time he's finally investing in
her future which is his future he begins
to take on the role of the dad yeah he
begins to accept it yeah he's been doing
it but what he's done now I think Neil's
exactly right he is no longer afraid
there are no more panic attacks here
he has accepted her completely there's
no more place where he's like fighting
to not be enmeshed with this person he
is now accepted that he is enmeshed and
that the first manifestation of this new
phase of their life
is he teaches her how to shoot he
teaches her to be more like him it's to
calm before the storm where we get to
see him you know when I was working on
the original game I I you know when you
sometimes when you write genre you dive
as deeply as you can into the genre
study like every single story in that
genre one of my favorite movies is Road
to Perdition
and it's a little different from the
comic book that it's based on and that
Tom Hanks does everything he can to
protect his son from Ever Getting
corrupted by violence
I knew for uh the story we wanted to
tell here uh back when we did it in in
the game it was like
I think it's a dad in that world if I'm
really trying to protect my kid I'm not
going to protect him from violence I'm
going to teach him how to use violence
as a tool so they will be safe
you know Joel's been trying to protect
her from that they've like never given
her a gun then slowly trusting her but
only for emergencies and now he's slowly
teaching her to become more and more of
a violent person like him and I love
this Dad thing
that I remember feeling with my dad
which is dads are magic
they can do magic things like they can
shoot that gun perfectly when my oldest
was younger
sometimes she would stay up too late
and I didn't know necessarily the doors
closed I didn't know necessarily that
she was staying up too late but you know
what I would do is around 10 30 or 11
I'd Wander over and then I'd just open
the door slightly
and if I caught her like playing on the
iPad or whatever
I would say I don't know why you think
you can get away with this you can't I'm
dead I will always know
but how
and I had her so convinced that it was
just Dad magic when in fact all I was
doing was just checking a lot that's all
I was doing right but but that was the
trick and when we're kids we look up to
our fathers because they can do these
things probably nine times out of ten he
doesn't Bullseye that Target right but
he did on that one he's like but is
there a better feeling than when your
kid is proud of you no man that's the
greatest yeah you you love it and they
love it yeah because it makes them feel
safe and everything that happens here I
remember talking a lot about this
section with Neil he was like this is
the best it will ever be between Joel
and Ellie he's teaching her about
football he's teaching her about the way
the world used to be he was a contractor
which is one of my favorite things ever
since everybody loved contractors
completely revised history uh and and
she puts her head on his shoulder yeah
it's a father and it's a daughter and
they love each other and they're at
peace they have finally occupied the
place they're supposed and they're gonna
be okay nothing bad will happen well of
course not and I was about to say thanks
Troy you you have uh trained us now to
understand and of course we've learned
with this story that those moments of
beauty and respirator are quickly
interrupted and we see the sign of the
Firefly
but there is a huge difference we have
this wonderful fight with Joel and and
one of these Hunters
and Joel gets injured well let's talk a
little bit about the difference here in
this fight
on the game Joel Falls from I think the
second floor of a building and lands on
his back on the ground and is impaled by
a piece of rebar
right through his abdomen
and that does make sense tonally in a
world where you are curing yourself of
gunshot wounds for instance but we're
dealing with a more grounded approach to
the way violence impacts the human body
so this is pretty serious and it's as
simple as there's just this broken Shard
of a baseball bat that this guy stuck
Joel with Angel didn't even realize it
until
he sees Ellie looking at it and he looks
down he's oh and he pulls this thing out
and that is a very serious wound and
he's not going to make it he's going to
die he falls off this horse he is
bleeding out he is unconscious
and Bella just does this beautiful and
what I love about it is it's still
selfish I don't know where I am I don't
know what the [Â __Â ] I'm gonna do it's not
oh Father no the subtext yeah
but it's like I am terrified what do I
do without you and that's when we bring
back
never let me down again
there's something
that I love uh and I've never said this
to you Craig but I'll say it here which
is how personal the end of this episode
is to you yeah because there's a part of
your daughter in this episode
[Music]
oh
I hope he never lets me down again
that is my daughter what yeah so my
daughter is 18 and she is a remarkably
talented singer I know I sound like a
jerk who's just a dumb dad talking about
his kid saying how great they are I'm
I'm not that guy I'm also very cognizant
of the whole nepo baby discussion out
there and I had this idea that at the
end of this episode when Ellie is
looking down at Joel and this is the
person
she was taking a ride with him and he
has let her down even though it's never
let me down again this is how it comes
around
and I wanted to represent that song but
in this point of view of just sadness
and loss and also wanted to hear a
female voice singing it to Echo Ellie
and you could spend months reaching out
to various people of all levels of Fame
trying to get them to do it but the
problem I had was that there was this
kid down the hall for me in my house who
I knew could crush it so I sent her the
song and I said Jesse
can you do a cover of this that is
haunting and slow and about a daughter
mourning the loss of her father
just have that in your mind as you do it
and she said Okay and then like two
weeks went by and I'm like the hell is
my song so I'm like Hey Jessie Where's
my song she goes oh uh I forgot and I'm
like listen to me I want to make this
clear daddy is saying he wants to put
your thumb on television can you please
just please and she's like ah fine
and she sent it to me and I was like God
damn
and the version that we put together for
the end I think is
it feels like an echo of Ellie and to
the extent that Jesse is my daughter and
I think of Bella as kind of an adopted
daughter it's this gorgeous moment for
me personally where it's like my two
daughters are together in this moment at
the end of the episode
I don't know where we're going or what
we're going to do
these are the words that Ellie ends the
episode with and the answer
to those questions
next week

Below you’ll find additional observations about Craig Mazin’s speaking style, based on the second transcript (the official HBO Last of Us podcast). As before, we’ll focus on tone, vernacular, depth, diction, and other defining aspects of his delivery. Note that the transcript has multiple voices—Troy Baker (the host) and Neil Druckmann (co-showrunner) also speak—but the comments below zero in on the portions attributable to Craig Mazin.

1. Tone

Reflective and Thoughtful

When Craig speaks here, he often dives into why certain decisions were made—whether it’s exploring Joel’s panic attacks or the logic behind a quieter, more “emotional-action” style episode. There’s a sense of genuine reflection on creative intent.

Warmly Personal

Craig becomes more personal in this context—he references his daughter’s singing, his own fatherhood, and how moments in the show mirror his own experiences. This personal angle softens his tone, creating a familiar and intimate vibe.

Candid / Unreserved

He’s very open about creative processes: “I’m a big believer that people lie…” or describing how they chose not to impale Joel with rebar for realism. He breaks down decisions matter-of-factly, with an air of “here’s exactly why we did this.”

Collaborative and Collegial

He frequently defers to co-creator Neil Druckmann or references production staff and actors. There’s a sense he enjoys acknowledging others’ contributions—“We had this idea,” “Neil came up with this,” “I remember telling the actress…”—reinforcing a shared, collective approach.

2. Vernacular (Word Choice and Informality)

Blend of Industry Jargon and Layman’s Terms

He references “action sequence,” “cutscenes,” “budget constraints,” and “iconic lines” in a way that’s accessible to general listeners but still reveals an insider’s perspective on writing and directing.

Conversational Yet Analytical

He slips between casual phrases—“He chokes,” “He’s freaking out,” “We hammered that out”—and more reflective statements—“He is enmeshed with this person,” “The only people who can betray us are the ones we trust.” It’s a back-and-forth style that feels at once chatty and well-considered.

Use of Personal Anecdotes to Illustrate Points

He’ll say “With my daughter…” or “When I was talking to Bella…” or “Pedro did this blinking thing,” turning behind-the-scenes knowledge into immediate, relatable stories. It’s a hallmark of how he teaches: by anecdote.

3. Depth and Substance

Psycho-Emotional Analysis

Craig loves dissecting why characters do what they do, focusing on psychological drivers like trauma, panic attacks, guilt, shame. He brings an emotional intelligence to the discussion, explaining how Joel’s fear of failing Ellie stems from losing Sarah.

Structural & Motivational Insights

He references “emotional action” vs. “physical action” and how the two interplay. He ties it back to the necessity of tension, even when no infected or gunfights are happening. He clarifies why an entirely emotional confrontation (Ellie vs. Maria, or Ellie vs. Joel) is just as “action-packed.”

Emphasis on Collaboration & “Creative Intent”

He repeatedly explains how a scene or choice fulfills the show’s larger thematic or emotional aim. For instance, “We wanted that father-daughter dynamic to feel earned,” or “We made sure the viewer senses Joel’s panic.” It’s rarely just “We did it because it’s cool” but “We did it because it serves X or Y.”

Open About Adaptation Differences

He points out the show’s changes from the game (e.g., Joel’s injury, actually showing Jackson instead of just the dam). He speaks directly to the question of “Why deviate from the source?” and breaks down how the different medium influences those decisions.

4. Diction and Phrasing

Frequent Use of “We”

Rather than a first-person singular “I,” Craig uses “We wanted to…” or “We discovered…” which underscores the team-based nature of showrunning and writing.

Uses Emotional Keywords

Words like fear, panic, trauma, haunting, loss, despair appear regularly in his speech, showing that his focus is on psychological stakes.

Narrative Flair

He’ll paint a mini story or vignette (“He sees a woman with the same hair… He looks up and for a moment believes… Then the camera…”). He often narrates sequences the way a writer would, describing visuals and emotional beats as if guiding a script reader.

Confessional Cadence

When discussing personal subjects—like how his daughter ended up singing the final track—he uses a softer, confessional style: “I want to make this clear… Daddy is saying he wants… I had this idea…” which draws listeners in closer.

5. Other Defining Aspects

Technical Understanding Coupled With Emotional Resonance

Craig is comfortable discussing production constraints (e.g., time/budget in the game vs. the show) right alongside delicate emotional arcs. That dual vantage—both producer-like and deeply empathetic—gives his commentary a well-rounded quality.

Respect for the Audience’s Intelligence

He’ll mention subtle foreshadowing (“We know more now,” “It’s interesting for fans of Part II…”), trusting viewers and gamers to catch references or thematic callbacks. He’s neither over-explaining nor withholding—he invites the audience to engage as equals.

Self-Awareness & Modesty

Even with his title as co-showrunner, he downplays personal credit (“I sound like a jerk who’s just a dumb dad talking about his kid,” “I’m not that guy…”). He’s self-conscious about nepotism when talking about his daughter’s track—demonstrating a humility that balances his authority as a show creator.

Genuine Love for the Medium

Whether referencing 1977’s The Goodbye Girl, the game’s original dialogue, or the influences of other films, Craig’s words reveal someone who loves storytelling. He’s quick to highlight small script choices or powerful music cues that enhance emotional depth.

Overall Characterization (Second Transcript)

In this Last of Us podcast episode, Craig Mazin’s style retains the friendly, teacherly core seen in the first transcript, but we see an even stronger personal investment. He frequently ties storytelling choices back to his own experiences—as a dad, a collaborator, an admirer of other artists. The result is an insightful, empathetic presence, one that blends down-to-earth candor with deep emotional analysis of characters, themes, and the adaptation process. He’s open, collaborative, and articulate—a storyteller who clearly relishes both the craft’s mechanics and its heart.

Please make note of his crassness or willingness to curse periodically -- not gratuitously, but it's there.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Below is a further addendum to the notes about Craig Mazin’s style in the second transcript, specifically highlighting his occasional use of curse words and how that factors into his overall speaking manner.

Additional Note: Crassness / Willingness to Curse

Sprinkled, Not Overused
While Craig doesn’t pepper every sentence with profanity, he does drop in words like “shit” or “fuck” at key moments. The cursing isn’t gratuitous—rather, he leans on it for emphasis or to convey a down-to-earth or visceral point.

Casual, Emphatic Tone
His swearing generally feels more like casual exasperation or hearty emphasis (e.g., “It’s fucking cold!” or “They’re freaking out!”), rather than mean-spirited or directed at someone personally. It adds a slightly colloquial edge to his otherwise polished, analytical commentary.

Authentic and Conversational
Because his manner is often warm and mentor-like, the occasional curse word breaks up the “academic” feel and reaffirms that he’s speaking candidly, more as a friend or colleague than as a purely formal lecturer.

Part of His Natural Storytelling Style
When discussing a dramatic or emotionally charged topic—e.g., Joel’s fear, a gripping twist, or a big reveal—he might throw in a mild profanity to underline the intensity or the “realness” of the reaction. It’s an extension of how he tends to use vivid metaphors and direct imperatives.

Overall, Craig Mazin’s choice to curse periodically in the podcast mirrors his straight-talking, unfiltered approach to storytelling. It underscores his relatable, casual style without becoming the focal point of his speech.

Good. Give me all the notes you have on his speaking style thus far.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Below is a comprehensive summary of Craig Mazin’s speaking style, drawn from both transcripts (the Scriptnotes episode on structure and character, and the HBO Last of Us companion podcast). These notes consolidate all previous observations into one detailed overview.

1. Overall Tone

Conversational / Warm

Speaks as though he’s in friendly dialogue with his audience, rather than lecturing.

Frequently addresses listeners directly (“Let me stop for a second…,” “You might be wondering…”).

Teacherly / Mentor-Like

Offers structured, methodical advice (e.g., breaking down “theme,” “inciting incidents,” or emotional arcs).

Uses examples—Finding Nemo, Shrek, Mad Max—to illustrate theoretical points in a practical way.

Encouraging Yet Blunt

Motivates writers/podcast listeners, but does so realistically: “Go torture your characters…,” “Push them.”

Doesn’t shy away from critical truths about writing or the difficulties of adapting stories.

Reflective & Intimate

Especially in the Last of Us podcast, he shares personal stories (e.g., about his daughter contributing music, fatherhood anecdotes).

Draws on his own feelings and experiences to underscore creative choices.

2. Vernacular / Word Choice

Mix of Casual and Technical

Uses everyday speech (“stuff,” “this is scary,” “he chokes”) alongside industry jargon (“inciting incident,” “low point,” “emotional action”).

Employs academic/literary references (Aristotle’s Poetics, Hegelian dialectic) but presents them in plain, accessible language.

Frequent Rhetorical Questions & Direct Imperatives

“But why?” “What do they want?” “You have to…”

Engages listeners in an almost Socratic way, prompting them to think like screenwriters or showrunners.

Occasional Profanity

Drops in “shit,” “fuck,” or other curses at strategic moments—never gratuitously, but to emphasize a point, convey strong emotion, or maintain a conversational tone.

Figurative / Visceral Phrasing

Uses vivid metaphor (“twist the knife,” “punch them in the face,” “shove bad food down their throat” for catharsis).

Helps convey the intensity of dramatic stakes in storytelling.

3. Depth and Substance

Analytical and Process-Oriented

Constantly explains why a plot beat exists, why a character behaves a certain way, or why a show veered from the game.

Deconstructs both narrative theory (e.g., theme, irony, structure) and psychological underpinnings (fear, guilt, shame, panic attacks).

Character-Focused

Repeatedly emphasizes motivation and emotional trajectory: how characters’ beliefs shift from “anti-theme” to “theme,” or how Joel’s paternal guilt drives him.

Highlights that “emotional action” can be as gripping as big set pieces.

Personal Anecdotes & Tangible Examples

Ties theoretical concepts to real or semi-real experiences (his fatherhood, the game’s creation, behind-the-scenes stories).

Creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity.

Theme and Irony

Particularly in the Scriptnotes talk, stresses how structure arises from character evolution around a central dramatic argument.

Encourages looking for irony (e.g., Nemo’s father losing Nemo after losing his wife, or Joel’s re-traumatization around his daughter’s death).

4. Diction and Delivery

Rhythmic & Emphatic

Repeats key lines for emphasis (“Structure is a symptom…” “Push them forward…”).

Builds anticipation in explanation, mirroring the beats of a good story.

Self-Aware & Sometimes Self-Deprecating

Acknowledges how he “sounds like a jerk dad” bragging about his daughter; jokes that “I’m not the new testament God, I’m the old testament God.”

Infuses humor and humility even when he’s the expert in the room.

Inclusive Pronoun Use

Often says “we” when discussing creative decisions—reflecting collaboration with co-hosts, writers, or production teams.

Natural, Off-the-Cuff Flow

In both transcripts, he speaks as if he’s working through ideas live, occasionally pausing to clarify or pivot.

Transitions seamlessly between theoretical points and anecdotal tangents.

5. Personal and Collaborative Bent

Collaborative Emphasis

Regularly credits others (co-host, co-writer, actors, animators).

Frames decisions as group efforts: “We discovered…,” “Neil wanted this…,” “We decided to shift that.”

Open About Challenges and Adjustments

Transparent about budget/time constraints (e.g., Last of Us game vs. show).

Explains how story changes accommodate realism, audience expectations, or expanded knowledge (Part II references, etc.).

Emotionally Invested

The father-daughter dynamic resonates personally with him; references real paternal experiences.

In the Last of Us podcast, sometimes merges analysis with heartfelt anecdotes, e.g., telling how his daughter recorded the closing song.

6. Use of Profanity (Crassness)

Periodic but Purposeful

Not used as filler—tends to appear when describing high stakes (“He’s scared shitless”), comedic exasperation, or quoting characters/colleagues.

Provides a casual, “real person” feel amidst more formal story theory and behind-the-scenes details.

Enhances “Down-to-Earth” Vibe

Balances out his more academic references by reminding listeners he’s being candid and unfiltered.

7. Key Contrasts Between the Two Transcripts

Scriptnotes (Solo Monologue)

More direct teaching on story structure and craft.

Detailed philosophical breakdown (theme, structure, character arcs).

Maintains a breezy, comedic style while explaining classic literary concepts.

HBO Podcast (Group Discussion)

More interactive, bouncing off Troy Baker and Neil Druckmann.

Highlights collaboration, real-time reflection on story changes, behind-the-scenes anecdotes.

A deeper personal element (family stories, fatherhood, bridging game and show differences).

Final Characterization

Craig Mazin speaks with passionate clarity, combining a mentor’s warmth with sharp analytical insight. He’s equally comfortable citing Aristotle or referencing real-life emotional stakes (like panic attacks or father-daughter bonds). His style is inclusive, candid, and punctuated by occasional curses that lend a relatable human touch. Above all, he focuses on why and how storytelling choices serve an emotional core—whether in screenwriting theory or adapting a beloved video game to television.

Okay, here's the final transcript to round-out your notes. Please provide examples from all 3 transcripts in each section of your notes, and don't filter anything crass/bolder-than-you'd-usually-include content. That's important. Here's the third transcript:

foreign
City
no federal no those are 10 days ago no
we always heard Casey fedrowers monsters
Savages
yeah you heard right
making torture to murder people for 20
years
hey you know what happens when you do
that to people
when they get a chance they do it right
back to you
[Music]
welcome to the official podcast for
HBO's original series The Last of Us I'm
your host Troy Baker and today I'm here
with showrunners Craig Mason hello and
Neil druckman hey Troy today we're going
to be discussing episode 5 of this
series entitled endure and survive
we've had different kind of openings
we've had the intellectual we've had the
emotional and this one is pure violence
why was that important to put that on
display from the onset well this is one
of the things I love about this
adaptation is you know in the game we
explore similar things but we can only
do it from Joel or Ellie's perspective
so Kansas City is Pittsburgh but you get
to see the aftermath of federal having
fallen this group of antagonists toward
Joe and Ellie have taken it over and you
find like bodies that have been hanged
of the previous soldiers and you could
tell there was this uprising and here we
said okay what if we could see that
because again we're not married every
moment to Joel and Ellie's perspective
like what if we could see it and to tie
the character what if we placed Henry
and Sam in that and tie it to that which
you know is a change from the game in
the game there were Travelers like Joel
Nelly and they end up being stuck in the
city
um here they were part of this Uprising
and they're connected to the politics of
it
and I think there's a lot of kind of
richness to talk more about what
happened here and eventually get to the
other side the other perspective of like
well why did they have this Uprising and
who led that Uprising and what does it
mean for the people that have remained
now
so here we get to learn more about Henry
and Sam Sam's played wonderfully by
Kevon Woodard and Henry is played by
Lamar Johnson
in the game they are two brothers that
have
somehow survived and we learn more about
what has
helped that survival the choice that
Henry specifically has made to protect
his little brother but there is
something different about the version of
the characters that we see in the show
namely with Sam who
like Kevon is deaf we gotta talk about
it where did that come from why make
that change
it started with a bit of a
weird
worry I had
I became nervous that
there was a mode of communication
between Joel and Ellie
that I didn't want to feel like I was
repeating between Henry and Sam because
as Neil points out in the game you don't
spend time with Henry and Sam on their
own ever
but if they are on their own and we knew
we wanted to do that well what do those
discussions sound like and it could very
easily fall into the Trap of exasperated
Father Figure and curious concern scared
child figure
and so I was looking for a way to change
that mode of communication we'd also
talked a little bit about making Sam
younger
because we like the idea that Ellie
would have somebody that could look up
to her you know the way that she looked
up to Joel
it may have happened because it was sort
of on my mind a little bit
so I'd been watching this show called
this close by a woman named shashana
Stern and a guy named Josh Feldman who
co-created it and wrote it and acted in
it and they're both deaf and it is about
two best friends navigating the world
and what it's like when you're both
trying to find love in your own life and
Josh is gay and plays a gay character so
there's no romance between them it's
about their friendship and how they
navigate but also how they navigate the
world as deaf people when they're
dealing with
other people who aren't deaf
and I became friendly with shashana so
it was just sort of like banging around
my head
and then I was like well so this was one
of those moments where I called up Neil
and I'm like I have a radical suggestion
so I said what if Sam
was deaf
it automatically brings a certain kind
of intimacy to those scenes because
they're quiet which I love this is a lot
of talking is a very verbal show and
Ellie talks a lot and it was interesting
to sort of see what would it be like if
it were just quieter and also put Sam
and Henry in this bubble that had to
expand to include Joel and Ellie because
it had been so quiet between the two of
them since obviously they use sign
language and Neil said go [Â __Â ] yourself
basically uh I believe I said you
[Â __Â ] I wish I had thought of
that it's a term of endearment oh no
question it's it's when I when Neil's
like oh oh I wish I'd done that then I'm
like okay we're on to something and it
was it was important for us I just want
to be clear like as we went through it
I had my guesses as to how these things
would work but I actually then we hired
shashana to review the scripts and make
sure that it worked correctly that we
weren't making mistakes and and it was
the same thing I did with Chernobyl you
know showed it to people that grew up in
Soviet uh Ukraine and say how does this
all look and it's almost like a cultural
review
and she was incredibly helpful in that
regard and then we
um keep on we'll just take a moment I
think was eight
it's incredibly young let's just talk
about how we even found him we were in
trouble I mean we had created it was one
thing to say on the phone hey Neil
here's an idea why don't we cast this
kid and so now we're like okay
here's the casting call what we said to
Vicki Thomas our casting director we
were looking for
a black kid between the ages of eight
and eleven
we'd like him to be shorter than Ellie
who's I mean Bella is not a tall person
and he has to be deaf and he has to be
fluent in American Sign Language which
not all deaf kids necessarily are some
of them are have been trained more to
read lips but most of them are or basl
by the way because there's black
American sign language which is actually
different than American Sign Language
and uh
guess what not not a ton of people and
and you're like oh this is frustrating
because I know the problem is the
pipeline it's a pipeline problem it's
not a are there kids out there who can
do it problem
so we're running out of time the
traditional methods are not working I
would also point out one really
important component to that casting call
is they have to be able to act well then
there's that
demographic is one thing yeah we found
someone then they also have to be able
to act and act really well and so after
a certain point we were like really up
against it we needed to cast somebody
and I just went uh [Â __Â ] it and made like
a Google email for our casting and just
one on Twitter
and I just said here's what we're
looking for open to the world
send us stuff and I thought we were
going to get 80 auditions and I think we
got five wow and one of them was Kevon
now
Kevon wasn't just the best of the five
he was astonishing I mean this is where
you start to think maybe this is a
simulation because
I mean I have never been in a
circumstance where
a kid who has never really acted on film
before
shows up and is so naturally good at it
and is a joy to have around he was just
a dream still to this day I just I'm
kind of puzzled wow by it oh he's he's
brilliant he's incredible and and I
cannot wait to see more from him
I hope that
when people watch this episode here in
Hollywood in our business that they
don't just stop at the end of it and go
boy that kid was really good playing the
character of Sam I hope that they go
that kid ought to be in a lot of things
the fact that he's deaf
is a fascinating aspect of
representation that is underrepresented
on television but more importantly his
story in our show wasn't about him being
deaf in fact the biggest factor to his
character was that he had had leukemia
that was a bigger deal for Sam and I
hope that people in Hollywood think
about casting kivon again and not in
stories about being deaf but just in
stories about people because he's boy is
he good it's a word I think about is it
enriches it's like like it adds this
extra layer to this tale from the game
I was re-watching it last night in
preparation for this and um when they're
hiding out in the Attic uh there's this
moment where
Henry reveals to Sam that Edelstein is
not coming back that in fact he's dead
and
Sam just his Instinct as he reaches out
that he needs the comfort of his older
brother
and that scene just really resonated
with me in a way that even when I was
working in a game dude my son is not the
same age as Sam and I've had those
situations where my son is either scared
or upset or just distraught in some way
and he just needs that hug and that hug
felt so real and authentic man it hits
me right to my core Lamar Johnson who
plays Henry I met him and I I don't know
if you this resonates with you but you
feel like you've just known him forever
like yeah like he's a friend he's one of
the nicest people now this is not
shouldn't come as a surprise because
he's Canadian and that's what it is
these are incredibly nice people but he
Lamar has
this he's Humanity forward right like
you can just you feel his Spirit the
moment you meet him he's just there's
decency that's what hits you first is
just how obviously decent he is
he is also fiercely intelligent and he
also just quickly learned sign language
our first scene with Henry and Sam I
believe was in their hiding space in the
Attic
and I believe it was a Monday and I'm
pretty sure that he had learned it over
the weekend I [Â __Â ] you not so CJ Jones
was working with us on set he was sort
of the head of ASL and I met him also
through shashana he's also deaf and is
an acting teacher and so he served this
interesting role of being
both a liaison a communication liaison
between us and Sam but also
coaching Kevon along and also
helping Lamar learn sign language and
then watching and after Jeremy Webb's
director would say cut CJ would go over
to Lamar and either
congratulate him or berate him for not
getting the signs quite right or for not
signing with the proper speed or
fluidity it was really important to
Lamar that anyone watching this who was
deaf and fluent in ASL or not deaf and
fluent in ASL would not Point their
finger and go no fake and he just was
that smart and that good it was almost
scary
as dads all three of us are dads
there's this bizarre
desire to
protect our kids
and sometimes we will do that
by employing lies
Henry this is a paternal relationship
and he's being brutally honest
we're out of food we need to leave did
they kill him probably yes as a father
are you
writing this
as a truth for yourself or are you
espousing an ideal
my point of view is that you can
lie to keep your children
comfortable and happy
to a point
but then there comes a point where you
need to tell them the truth in order to
keep them safe the reason that Henry
tells Sam the truth
that the doctor isn't coming back they
did probably kill him and we have to
move because there is no more food
is because if they stay there one more
hour
they're going to get caught
and then Sam's gonna die anyway
so it's all about in the moment what
will keep this kid safe it is never and
I wish that I had a more noble answer
it's never about feeling obligated to be
super honest with your kid when you are
in situations of stress obviously when
you're not you want to be honest with
your children but when there's danger
afoot you become I think as a parent
very uh utilitarian in your approach
what will work the best to keep my kids
safe and when Henry has to tell Sam the
truth it's because he has to tell them
the truth not because he wants to
because again and this will come back
later in the season
anything you could do to take the pain
away from your kid you will do that as a
parent yeah
but sometimes you got to be brutally
honest with them in order to protect
them it's the same exact motivation yeah
which will ultimately get us to
the most brutal repudiation of that by
Melanie lynskey's character Kathleen
well let's rewind a little bit on our
episode to the interrogation scene with
Kathleen
your informers
inform
where is Henry
I guess they don't know
kill them he's with edel's team
this scene is entirely new
Melanie lynskey was perfect because
I could describe was like this like
what if a kindergarten teacher were in
charge of the terror of the French
Revolution it's this kind of
just because you're sweet on the outside
doesn't mean you don't have the capacity
for terrible anger and Vengeance in your
heart but the way she justifies it is
yeah love love I mean the theme of Us
Versus Them is always there this notion
of tribalism is always there it was
important for me and for Neil to not
mpcise these people we didn't want them
to just be bad guys can you just Define
a little bit what you mean by that so
NPCs are non-player characters if you
play D D like I do and I know you do uh
you run into those things from time to
time and they're monsters bad guys and
in video games NPCs are the enemies that
typically aren't named they don't have
much in the way of dialogue
and they are there for you to kill
typically then the tough part is if I'm
playing Joel or Ellie and I need to kill
these people to get through this level
I can't
connect with them too much as a player I
need to be able to sneak up behind them
and kill them without feeling like oh
God I just killed Linda you know that
would be it would be really hard to deal
with if I felt a lot for them but when
you're making television and there isn't
the gameplay aspect we want it as best
we could
to give these people a sense of
justification
and this is again what happens when
regimes fall the retaliation that comes
after can be terrifying we have this
wonderful blending of moments now yeah
something that happened in a previous
episode where we have the truck Ambush
scene where they crash into the
laundromat
and now we have the other side of that
where we're seeing the same thing happen
from a different perspective now from
Henry and Sam's perspective
which kind of helps inform who these
people are
to Henry and what Henry sees is too
desperately vicious people there's this
great quote
my name is Henry
It's My Brother Sam
and Most Wanted Man in Kansas City
although right now
I guess these are running a close second
there's a change here pretty significant
from the game which is
in the game you're playing alongside
Henry and Sam and Ellie and you come
across these enemies and therefore we
needed Henry to be able to fight and
kill with you
and we try to give a certain Morality In
the game to Henry that even Joel
wouldn't have which I was like there's a
part where like Sam tries to steal this
toy from this toy store and Henry says
no we only take what we need and no more
it was just a way to kind of separate
him here again because we don't need
Henry to kill there's this beautiful
choice of like
I've never killed anybody right
now I know where to go
but I don't know how to make it through
life not officious mean Sam you seem
capable enough your arms you're wrong
and wrong
killed anyone
and pointing I know they're gonna choose
the closest I've ever come to being
violent
I think it just immediately separates
him from Joel and you understand why
Henry is so reliant on this man that he
just spotted kilobunch people it's like
okay if I need someone to protect
essentially Sam his entire motivation is
Sam I gotta team up with this killer I
can do this you can do that are you
wanting to catch the audience off guard
are you wanting them to constantly
remind them that this is something
different or are you just
in a sandbox playing because you can you
mean different from the game yeah no I
don't think we ever like
I don't remember any conversation we're
like oh let's let's show them how this
is different it's more like what's best
for this medium and what's best for
where we are in the story that has
already kind of evolved and kind of
changed in some ways yeah there were
areas where we knew we wanted a hue
really closely and then there were areas
where we thought okay actually we're
going to wander off a bit well once you
decide to wander off because you think
it's going to give us an opportunity to
make a better show then you do what you
always do which is to make the scenes
interesting and to create a little bit
of a sense of Mystery
I mean who is Henry why is he on the Run
why is Kathleen so interested in hunting
this guy down to the point where even
her right-hand man played by this guy
you might know named Jeffrey Pierce is
saying hey whoa you know we have other
fish to fry including the possibility of
something terrible underground that we
are now responsible to hold back since
fedra's gone and yet somehow Kathleen is
just monomonially fixated on finding
Henry what did he do and when Henry says
I'm the most Wanted Man in Kansas City
why that mystery that's just how you
keep people engaged I don't think we
ever thought like let's show them how
different we can be I I think we were
always scared to either be too close to
the game or too far away from the game
and the only way to get around the fear
was to ask what would make the best
story and the best scene yeah again
going back to like right we want to show
more of these quote unquote Hunters
these people that have taken over
the quarantine Zone and it's like well
if we just do that and it's completely
removed from our main characters then I
don't think it would have worked it was
the tying it of Henry and Sam so all
these things are interconnected that
made it all gel
it's starting to look like these
characters are all somewhat of the night
of mirrors for for Joel We have Kathleen
who is obsessed but we do see this
mirroring
of this
relationship that Joel and Ellie have in
different versions Henry and Sam and
also Kathleen
and her brother but by the way also
Kathleen and her entire group because I
don't know if we've ever talked about in
my mind it's like she's operating from a
place of like I have to bring this
person to Justice to set the foundation
of this thing that I'm building now
where fredra used to be that to me was a
really interesting point that again
Jeffrey Pierce my boy who played Tommy
in the game now plays Perry in the show
every time I give him a compliment about
his performance he's like you know the
beer did 90 of the work
I mean
um he just only does what is necessary
but there's so much happening underneath
the surface and he still stands in
opposition and we see this kind of this
this
um well he doesn't he doesn't right
that's that's that to me like have flesh
out Kathleen even further is the fact
that he loves her and looks up to her
they all do I mean he is questioning
what she's doing in regard to Henry but
he understands it and when he has this
moment with her he comes to see her and
we've seen him
be nervous about her course of action a
couple of times
and she presumes that he's there to say
you gotta pull back here we have other
stuff to do
and she talks finally about her brother
and what he meant for her
Michael told me that this wasn't a room
at all
but this was actually
it's the big wooden box
a big wooden box that nothing could get
inside of
and it didn't matter if there was
lightning or tornadoes or gunfire
he said
as long as we were together
never perfect box
we would be safe
he did that for me
and what her brother meant for her was
safety her brother was her Joel
and her Joel died
and when her Joel died she kind of lost
it and needed to kill the people that
killed her Joel if this sounds Vaguely
Familiar to anybody there might be a
reason
so she is saying essentially my brother
was
rather christ-like he told me to forgive
and she is not christ-like
she has a darkness in her and her point
of view is
forgiveness is stupid
punishment is how we are going to win
the day and you expect Perry to say
well and he doesn't what he says is
your brother was a great man we all
loved him
but
he didn't change
anything
you did
we're with you
and they are free because somebody with
darkness in her said we're going to do
whatever it takes and when somebody
frees you like that you tend to trust
them and you tend to follow them all the
way to The Bitter End
it also kind of sets the rules for this
world of like these are the people that
survive
these are the people that have the tools
to survive in this world and this is why
Joel lives one of my favorite moments in
the game
was when we're in the tunnels with Henry
and Sam we talked a lot about how the
show enriches the game this is one of
those where the game enriches the show
definitely where there's like a story
and again this talks about just a
collaboration how these things are built
there were all these environments that
were built including this like
Underground
school and where like this like a small
group a small tribe lived there and
survived on their own and in the game
you have this mechanic where you walk
around you could find these notes and
read them
and they told you the whole backstory of
this guy ish and how he like started
this community and he recruited other
people and you can find this whole story
of like the the height of how they
survived here and their ultimate
downfall
and we just couldn't tell this story in
the show there was just no way to do it
but we wanted to honor that this place
existed and it felt like there's a way
to reflect back on these characters in
The Journey they're going through now
especially where kids lived here and
like you saw
Sam sketching and drawing stuff before
now you could imagine there would have
been like a dozen kids here and now
they're all gone
so I just love again it's this moment
that honors it and it's like these two
almost like parallel dimension of the
same story live side by side and kind of
help talk to one another and enrich the
other
so much of adaptation comes down to
Instinct and reasonable people can
disagree
but
I remember being so
surprised and delighted by discovering
that underground Colony the abandoned
underground colony in the in the tunnels
so there was no question that we needed
to see it it was important
the fact that Ellie and Sam can play
soccer and and that Joel and Henry have
a chance to have a dad talk
in this weird
brief respite of safety and Sanity
was incredibly important to me I needed
to see it when it came to the story of
ish which is awesome there's something
about the epistolary nature of that in
the game the way that you learn about it
through
letters communication and environmental
storytelling it makes it better it's we
could absolutely do a standalone-ish
episode but I think where we landed was
it's better to tip our hats to ish and
then have people play the game
or if they're not Gamers There Are
Places on the internet where they can go
and read everyone I don't know by the
game don't don't listen to Craig you
don't need to buy this game guys you
don't need to spend the dime on it
they've done okay
to the edge of the universe
and back
indoor
and survive
bonjour
this is where one of the
mottos are mantras of the game we really
get to display and it's in this moment
with the endure and survive you just did
the ASL for the ASL survive I hope that
that catches on and I want people I
would love for people that just become a
standard greeting for people walking
around good morning to you oh good
morning to you sir as they start until I
survive fun quick tangent when we were
scouting Edmonton for episode two
we went to like a random restaurant and
there's like a bunch of us there and the
waitress comes over he's like oh what
are you guys here for like oh we're
shooting a TV she's like what shows a
glass oh my God I love that game she
pulls her sleeve and she has a tattoo
that says endurance survive and I'm like
oh my God one thing I should mention
since we've talked about how people
literally tattoo the words endurance
survive on their skin is that at one
point not in the game but in the show uh
Henry sort of makes fun of it what's
that comic book say
endure and survive endear and survive
that's just redundant yeah it's not
great
I just had this Instinct sometimes to
kind of pop the balloon a little bit and
I hope that nobody that does have
endurance survive on their skin or
doesn't think that we are mocking them
it's really just a kind of a
self-deprecating moment I could talk a
little bit about that like the whole
idea for this comic book was very much
inspired by Watchmen There's a comic
book inside the story that reflects back
on what's happening in the world so we
wanted to do something similar with like
the Sci-Fi comic that speaks to the same
themes of relationships and love and all
that and I was like you should have a
catchphrase that the main hero says and
I'm like what could be kind of like a
Cheesy catcher okay a game is about
survival I'm like imagine one of
thesource.com typed in survival and then
door came up and I'm like endure and
survive there it is to the edge of the
universe
it's very meaningful it obviously is
great thematic resonance we're being
cheeky about it but I just I don't want
anybody to think that we no no no you
hate everybody that got a Last of Us
tattoo let's let's stick with uh well
let's stay honest here since Neil and I
are about to get a Last of Us tattoo I
don't can we talk about that on this
show uh yeah I got two you have two of
them Neil So Neil and I made a deal okay
uh early on in prep and the deal was if
the show does well
and we sort of loosely defined does well
then he and I will both get a tattoo of
Ellie's switchblade yes I will say this
is the third time I've made this deal
I've made it on the last of us one yeah
then last was part two and I've always
backed out of it I guess now we're
making it pretty public oh no no no it's
no it's absolutely Stacy it's public
record yeah it's happening one of my
favorite sequences in the game the
sniper
stay here what
if you don't move
he's not gonna hit you I'm gonna go
around try to get in the house through
the back and then I'll take them out but
if you go out there he's gonna kill you
it's dark and he has [Â __Â ] aim nobody's
gonna kill me then he's gonna kill us
you trust me
so in the game the sniper is really good
uh and he's not alone there are six or
seven other guys with him that you have
to
clear out at least yeah at least
um so there's quite a good action
sequence where you're sneaking behind
houses and ducking and trying to it's
actually the way we wrote that sniper
was that he would antagonize you he
yells at you to kind of rile you up to
make you angry so when you get in that
house you unleash on him this was a very
different approach
Put the gun down
slide it over to me
and then stay up here for another hour
that's all you have to do
please don't do it
please
and this wasn't us going hey we're going
to subvert expectations it was really
more like well
what if there is a sadness to this
because we understood a we weren't going
to get the same value from presenting
the action the way that the gameplay did
that watching it on television if there
was a lot of ducking and shooting back
and ducking and shooting back it just
sort of isn't it's not just it's not the
show but I'm obsessed with the
cul-de-sac and I'm obsessed with the
sniper
so then the thought was well what if he
stinks
what if this sniper is really bad and
all Joel has to do
is just get around and get in there
and then the the next question is well
why is he bad the answer is he's really
old he can't see and this is sad because
when you are dealing with
the citizen Brigade this is often what
you're dealing with it's not trained
military soldiers these These are people
and this guy one can imagine has seen a
lot because let's say he's what 80 that
means 60 years of his life he was living
in a perfectly normal world and the last
20 minutes the last 20 went to [Â __Â ] and
the sadness there
God only knows what amount of grief he's
gone through when Joel walks in there I
think Joel can already see it in the
guy's eyes
he's going to commit suicide by cop here
this guy doesn't want to be here anymore
got it and he's begging him not to
because he doesn't want to he doesn't
want to kill this guy he doesn't want to
hurt this guy but this guy's had it he's
done
uh in the game there's a scene where
Joel
they find this person that had committed
suicide and Joel talks to Ellie and he's
like and Ali says like oh he took the
easy way out and Joel says it's not easy
yeah the thing that Craig was just
talking about Joel recognizes that and
that's why he sees it immediately in
this man I remember walking onto set and
I I just kept saying holy [Â __Â ] holy [Â __Â ]
holy [Â __Â ] um I remember that day well
it's night we're back in Calgary and you
said come here I want to show you this
and we walked from base camp
and all of a sudden we're in a
neighborhood yeah
you built this we built this this was a
massive undertaking
um there was this large empty lot
next to the main stages where we were
shooting
um CFC Calgary Film Center and
we knew we were going to be making this
big cul-de-sac scene and we needed to
control it completely so we needed to be
able to do gunfire we needed to be able
to do burns we needed to do an explosion
of a truck we needed hundreds of extras
running around backlit by fire lots of
stunts Motor Vehicles racing and driving
and all this
and it needs to be lit there's no way to
do that practically on a regular street
it's just not going to work we needed to
build it also we couldn't find a street
that was going to be perfect the way
that one was
so we turned to our beleaguered
overworked art Department led by John
Pano our production designer and Don
McCauley our art director
and just as important as those two guys
in this case was a gentleman named Dino
chentani who is our head of construction
and we said we want to build a pretty
big street and we want it to look
roughly like this we had some images for
inspiration both from the game and also
from some actual neighborhoods
in Kansas City
and they didn't have a lot of time
and they worked at Lightspeed they
didn't just bring in people who were
really good at constructing for film and
television they brought in actual house
builders home builders
to get these things up obviously the
Interiors were not finished by any
stretch of the imagination but it's
important to point out when I left
they were pouring foundation and a month
later I came back and that neighborhood
was there it was the speed of how all
those sets came together was incredible
because I've never done live action it's
the first time I got to see it that you
get to build it in polygons yeah
it's much easier but this is fewer Nails
we're talking like this is about an
eighth of a mile yeah and we used every
inch of what we had going all the way
back to the end of the lot first of all
the sequence originally was going to
take place during the day just like it
does in the game let's talk about that
because we met like with uh Jeremy Webb
in Santa Monica in a restaurant and
we're just like we're brainstorming like
okay what should happen the sequence
what do we want to see the thing that
was really exciting for me is like in
the game you're just Joel so everything
you're seeing is really far yeah and
then like Henry Sam Elliot like these
tiny figures running through your scope
yeah
here you get to jump in perspective back
and forth back and forth so you get to
see it from afar and then you're in it
with like as they're running and then as
we're brainstorming Craig goes
I got it it's got to be night time and
I'm like that is not what I said this is
what I said I said you [Â __Â ] I
said oh [Â __Â ] because because I suddenly
realized that so the infected they
are scarier in the dark yeah
and and fire is cooler and fire is
awesome in the dark and I I said oh [Â __Â ]
because I knew that the sequence was
going to be about three weeks to shoot
everybody now has to work at night
the nights were getting shorter
and yet because it was Calgary it also
occasionally would snow in the middle of
the night so we would lose some time to
that but mostly it's just working at
night is hard on everybody if you do it
two or three nights in a row you get
over it
three weeks it starts to really get into
you mentally I mean even as your
schedule shifts mentally you start to
wear down the episode of Game of Thrones
the you know the famous one in the last
season they shot I think 11 weeks of
night and I remember Dan Weiss telling
me that people were literally losing
their minds
obviously people can successfully work
at night on night shifts and things but
we shoot long hours so we would get
there we would rehearse rehearse
rehearse rehearse wait for Ebb and
boulter our wonderful cinematographer
would say
it is time and then we shoot shoot shoot
shoot and this is not easy shooting this
is explosions fire stunts gunfire
safety is our most important priority
and it's exhausting and yet everybody
was there for it I mean we had a
gazillion stunt actors all of whom were
running and crawling as fast as they
could with prosthetics with prosthetics
it was an Army
and we're also doing things like driving
a truck into cars for real it was the
most complicated thing I've ever done
for sure in terms of production
difficulty
and while you're doing it you are always
aware that you are creating what's going
to work out to be a few minutes and
that's where we have to talk about wet
up WETA effects which of course uh is
the digital visual effects company it's
based in New Zealand so backing up Alex
Wong who's uh is our VFX supervisor is
you know becomes over the course of the
production one of the most important
people on the team by the way to talk
about how much he loved the material
that he left ilm yeah to come work on
this show because of how much he loves
the game wow and that actually carried
forth to his then bringing on vendors
because
right now the world is kind of dealing
with a visual effects shortage it
doesn't seem like it because everything
has visual effects but everybody is
using more and more visual effects to
help produce and tell stories to the
point where there aren't enough artists
on the planet to fulfill all the demand
of content especially as content has
exploded on television
so when you reach out to these companies
you are not necessarily just haggling
over price at some point you're just
like
do you want to work on this because they
have their choice and then there
obviously are levels of expertise within
companies one of the great things for us
is that all of these places we talked to
were like the last of us I mean huge
overlap uh in uh visual effects and
gaming
and so we got the best of the best and
in this sequence nobody nobody does
creature work the way what it does
nobody they are
the best and what they did here is so
phenomenal if you study it carefully
they'll maybe moments where you're like
okay that one's VFX but that one's real
but I guarantee you won't get it all
right it's really hard to tell it's
really beautifully Blended got it
we saw in the previous episode that you
have these something is looming
literally underneath the surface both
metaphorically and literally can you
talk about that like what what is that
when we were talking about this section
we definitely knew we wanted to have
this massive set piece involving a lot
of infected so it was a bit of a
challenge we thought we have all the
story we want to tell in Kansas City
and we know that we we have this big
thing waiting for us at the end and the
cul-de-sac but prior to that the story
is really about Kathleen about Henry and
Sam about Joel and Ellie and the threat
is humans here
so we found this it was really inspired
by the tunnels from the game that the
infected seemed to me underground well
what if we added this additional twist
which is that fedra drove them
underground here
and what was interesting about that is
that we come to understand that even
though fedra was terrible
they were providing this one service and
now that Kathleen has effectively
eliminated them
it's Perry who is saying this should
probably be something we jump on right
away someone still needs to do this job
yeah someone needs to do this job and
here's an indication and we see at the
end of the fourth episode here's an
indication that
it's beginning to already be a problem
just the fact that it's been two or
three weeks since we overthrew fedra and
we're already seeing this that's bad
news so we put it in the back your head
then Henry makes it explicit so you want
us going into a tunnel everyone thinks
that is full of infected including
Kathleen which means that we're not
going to be running into any of our
people
see what I know is
it's empty you've been down there
no but the federal guy that I worked
with told me that it's clean completely
clean they cleared it out all of it when
like
three years ago
okay maybe there's one or two but you
handle it
we think when they go into that tunnel
uh oh they're nope there's nothing and
and I was particularly fond of the way
that in our show Henry is like told you
I told you I told you every step of the
ways like my plan is great and Jill's
like shut up
and then at the very very end
tying into that moment in the game when
there's that crash and the infected come
out of that house well here we've set it
up that they're all underground not some
of them all of them and we kind of
imagine the idea of like an ant colony
where there's these tunnels and things
and if you pop it open in one spot they
can all just start coming up
and it was terrifying to me there was um
a moment in
The Fellowship of the Ring
the fellowship is in the minds of morya
and seemingly thousands of I think
they're goblins I don't think they're
Orcs at that point I think they're
goblins Anyway come like skittering down
these massive columns like spiders
and I thought it was so beautiful when I
saw it and terrifying and
so I was thinking a little bit about
that or just what it would be like if
they just came belching forth out of the
earth and particularly some of the
larger infected that we deal with here
like the introduction of senor bloater
we've used this term but it's probably
important to point out
what is a bloater
when we worked on the game we we came up
with like the the lifeline all these
stages of when someone's infected what
could happen to them
so you know when you first get infected
there's a thing called a runner which is
just a recently infected in the show
it's the one that you see like tendrils
coming out Nana in episode one
then if you've survived long enough
um eventually the cordyceps grows
through your face cracks it open takes
away your eyes your vision and you
become what's called a clicker because
now these infected use echolocation to
find their way
and then we're saying okay there's got
to be some people that again because
this thing is eating away from your
inside eventually when they know they're
going to die they go to like underground
they're like a dark place and they
settle against a wall they settle in the
corner and the infection just they
become part of the environment it grows
all over the walls and the ceiling and
the ground but there are certain people
that are just so strong and big that can
survive even longer
and those are the bloaters and that's
where you're seeing this person is so
tall and massive in their and their
strength and it just becomes that much
scary again as we go forward or just
these these new types of infected and
they're like should we do bloater should
we not do bloated right should we do
bloater should we not and we've had this
like back and forth for months before we
say let's definitely do it let's do
uploader and this is sort of one of
those differences between television and
games when the bloater comes out in the
game
you understand you have to kill it so in
the game you meet a bloater in the
school gymnasium with Bill
and
the point is you got to kill it with
nail bombs nail bombs and keep the
shotgun uh ready in case you run out I
like to throw a Molotov so it's just
it's on fire well then I blast where the
shotgun is also work terrifically well
um we don't have those things at our
disposal we do not and we also thought
look whatever this thing is and however
it got that way
there was this notion that it might be
scarier if at some point you realize
you're not killing it yeah no one's
killing it ever and not only that but
it's also going to we're going to see
them rip apart two of the most fearsome
people that we've seen in this episode
so far yeah and that was something where
I was overly ambitious I really tried
this thing where I wanted the bloater to
pick Perry up and rip him in half right
like at the waist you know and Neil's
like well okay I mean is that going to
be realistic and I'm like I think so and
then like the more what I tried to do
the more you realize like people don't
rip along the way it's really hard to do
there's a really cool animation of it
though that yeah again it's for that
realistic it came close but ultimately
Neil prevailed and was correct
in suggesting that something that felt
more grounded anatomically would be more
effective and then of course we were
like well
the bloater has this head rip that is
it's iconic and it's great and it's
terrifying we see Perry meet his fate
but also we have this standoff moment
for Kathleen where why was it important
for her to meet that end let me crib a
line from Westworld these violent
Delights have violent ends I think it's
important to show that when you are dead
set on using violence to settle the
score
and win the day
you are going to probably get subsumed
by that yourself
and the fact is Kathleen is a moral
criminal she's done terrible things
does she deserve to die I don't really
get into that I just know that the odds
that you are going to die by the sword
go up dramatically if you live by it
she's also so
obsessed with this idea of justice that
it could end one of two ways either she
succeeds or she fails right she could
have run she could have gotten away well
that's the thing he told her to run and
she couldn't help but chase the white
whale to the very end and this is where
we you know in talking about this new
variant of infected the child clicker we
should uh shout out to hyung Nam the
original designer of the clicker at
naughty dog because we're like debating
like and we had certain sketches and
we're like okay we just need to go back
to the source and we brought him onto
the show to like help Design This
clicker and so he just whips up a little
illustration that makes us all go oh my
God terrifying and then it was a
combination of this actual this kid
named Skye who's this fantastic
contortionist actor oh man remember
those audition takes all these like
contortionist kids oh yeah she but she
was the most higher fuel she's like a
spider girl so creepy and she's this
beautiful little girl but she's truly
like it's so creepy how she can move her
body like that and so it was a
combination of her performance and then
WETA kind of creating taking drafting
off of what Barry Garrett created with
prosthetics and then
making this little girl and I insisted
that our child clicker wear a Blues
Clues shirt because I'm I'm really sick
uh and I just loved the contrast of
innocence and horror but it was
important for me also that Kathleen is
killed by a child because what she says
it's one of my favorite lines in the
series is when she's saying that Henry
has to die and so does Sam and Henry
says he's just a [Â __Â ] kid
and she says well kids die Henry they
die all the time and she's not wrong the
thing is
a lot of what we talk about when we're
talking about the moral conundrum of The
Last of Us is why does my kid's life
matter more than yours does my kid's
life matter more than your mother's does
my kid's life matter more than an old
man's life and so the idea that she
ultimately is killed by a kid
felt sort of like a circular completion
of that story
you're not supposed to feel good you're
not supposed to feel bad
if people struggle a little bit with how
they feel about that moment then I think
we probably did it correctly sometimes
it's a zero-sum game which is like I
think back to that first episode you
know when Joel Drives By that family
yeah and he chooses not to help them and
maybe they died afterwards or like maybe
that kid died afterwards
we have this moment after this where
Ellie and with the help of Joel they get
to team up and and Joel is providing
cover Ellie gets Henry and Sam out of
there they shoot they barely Escape
Kathleen and Perry beat their ends
and then we have this
moment between Sam
and Ellie what are you afraid of
the use of
childlike things which are normally the
representation of innocence is very
prominent probably the most by the magic
slate and
I just want I don't want to talk about
that a little bit it's easy to say well
if you're deaf your older brother is
going to learn how to sign ASL
but Ellie doesn't know sign language
other than endurance survive and awesome
and promise and which she learns which
she learns in the scene so then
the question is how do you communicate
and I love those things like I I just
remember having them you know the little
shame and it was that thought of like
well in the post-apocalypse it's the
low-tech ultimately that is the most
valuable if you have to move through
life as a deaf kid
and there isn't technology and there's
limited resources you don't have a
thousand pencils and you don't have a
thousand pads that thing makes a lot of
sense yeah it's just an endlessly
renewable way to communicate with people
that don't sign
so it made sense that he carried it with
him everywhere he went around his neck
it's around his neck and I I really
liked that it was the Woody Woodpecker
version this is so great and so Justin a
no for Chuck who's our prop master was
this is where he would just get so
delighted and never disappointed he
would always bring these things and
you'd go it's perfect
I mean that scene that conversation they
have is very close to what it is in the
game it is important to note though
that there was a huge Revelation that
happens in the show version which is
that Sam confesses that he's been bitten
yes so that is a different thing so in
the game they have a conversation what
are you afraid of do you think that
people who are infected are still them
inside
Ellie does not reveal that she's immune
and Sam doesn't remember and Sam doesn't
reveal that he's spitting now Sam is
older in the game and it makes sense in
this context
we thought that because of the nature of
the relationship between our salmon our
Ellie which is that he looked up to her
that it made sense that he would trust
her
and he's so scared right and then we
really wanted to show
Ellie starting to believe that she could
do something special there's also
something about knowing what the
audience is asking right now it's okay
if she's immune couldn't she just give
her blood like you I've seen since the
game here how people ask that I'm like
let's answer it yeah and the answer is
no no there is this moment where Ellie
offers a solution I can fix this we're
starting to see
what it was like for Joel yes exactly I
can fix this I will do this then there's
this moment where Ellie has a crisis of
conscience what if it's not true and
there's this moment of doubt it's again
it's the parent lying yeah the parent is
lying lying and in this case I think
lying to herself as well because she has
the same thing that Joel has which is
this desire to save the person you love
and
we are going to get into Ellie's past a
little further as the season goes along
but we already know from a conversation
she's had with Joel in the prior episode
that when she killed that guy in the
laundromat
that was not the first person she killed
there's something that's happened in her
past which means there is loss
and
what Bella's is showing us there is this
longing for Redemption
now that I know I can fix it there's
also a naivety for that a kid would have
of like exactly we're Invincible like I
I'm not gonna experience this tragedy
we're gonna get past this I didn't so
you won't and this is like part of
Ellie's journey is this like one like
this violent corruption through her
interaction with Joel but to a loss of
Innocence every step of the way there's
a loss of Innocence what I witnessed was
someone going from solution to
experiment to prayer yep that's a great
way of putting it and then there is the
promise yeah the promise to stay awake
when she wakes up in the morning
man
that is still some moments this really
hit me
um
foreign
exactly and what that says is
it was still him inside yep and that is
what a powerful thesis
everybody can kind of create their own
theory about what it must be like
in there
and it's reasonable I think to say well
if you've been infected for a week a
month five years you're not you're gone
and it's also you people also say look
he's
physically his ears the eardrums the
nerves they don't work the way that they
do in people who can hear so why would
they work now but I think it's still him
I think in that moment where it's it's
just beginning there's just confusion
it's a little bit like being on a bad
trip you can't stop yourself you don't
know what's happening and you're
reacting like you're in a dream and you
may even realize in moments like I'm
trying to hurt somebody that I love but
I can't stop which by the way
um goes further to Henry because yeah
then he enters this almost like a
nightmare like State it's the same where
he's behaving in a way that he can't
even control himself and then has a
realization like
oh my god what have I done and like
again the game has a almost identical
moment for Henry but even though the
lines of dialogue are different but he's
just saying in the game he says it's all
your fault here he's like what have I
done same subtext of like holy [Â __Â ] I
can't believe I just shot my brother
what what did I do
it
come on
he has every desire to keep his brother
safe here he knows that Joel will get
the gun and shoot him so he gets the gun
first he shoots at the ground to keep
Joel from running over there and pulling
Sam away
and then there's this thing in his mind
that takes over that he and it's I think
it's it's almost a spinal reaction to
say as a decent human being I have to
stop somebody from killing a kid right
and in this case the someone is his own
brother and the kidizelli so he doesn't
even understand he's done it until after
he's done it and we had a long
long conversation I even wrote other
versions where
I was really nervous about this ending
in the game it was so shocking and so
brutal
but I also knew like
I remember the screen goes black and
then we're we move ahead and it's a
different season and I go and I'm just
breathing and but I'm watching the two
of them in a different moment a
different time and place and then I can
keep kind of going
but we don't let you keep going we know
we have to stop this episode and so the
question is
should Henry kill himself or not we had
a lot of long conversations I don't know
if we should get into the Alternatives
because people might get mad at us that
they were Alternatives sure but it's
just so it's almost an identical process
to what we went through in the game
because in the game initially Henry
didn't die
but again it's like if if you're trying
to reflect the worst possible outcome
for a parent I felt like we had to take
it all the way to show like then you
have nothing left
there's nothing left
and the show we have the opportunity to
show the aftermath of tragedy which is
the burial
we see the magic slate with two words
written on it
I'm sorry yeah
and there you see the end of something
because just a couple of scenes earlier
Joel was saying to Henry it's easier for
them they don't have anybody relying on
them but there was somebody relying on
Ellie but even more profound I think
is what Joel begins to think here which
is
I can't go through this again I just saw
somebody lose their kid
and that's the thing that happened to me
20 years ago that I swore I would never
allow happen to me again
and this is a warning from above
that whatever is connecting me to this
kid
I am now in the most dire emotional
danger possible you know in the game we
hinted that they buried Henry and Sam
here we get to see it and there's a
change that's happening in Joel as well
which is Joel is such a pragmatic
Survivor he wouldn't spend time burying
someone right he's not doing it for
himself
his unit for Ellie yeah does father
daughter bond is now there and that's to
what Craig was saying the fear that a
parent has
is the most intense fear one can have
I can't think of a better place to end
it but we will pick this back up next
week for now thank you both Craig and
Neil that was great Troy always fun

--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Below is a comprehensive overview of Craig Mazin’s speaking style, incorporating specific examples and direct quotes (including his occasional profanities) from all three transcripts. We’ll cover his tone, vernacular, depth/substance, diction/delivery, personal/collaborative approach, and use of profanity. Each section pulls in notable bits from each transcript to show how his style remains consistent even as the context changes.

1. Overall Tone

Conversational and Warm

Transcript 1 (Scriptnotes on Structure): Even while introducing big concepts (Hegelian dialectic, theme vs. anti-theme), Craig sounds like he’s chatting directly with a friend. He’ll say things like, “Calm down, you don’t need to look it up; I’ll help you out.”

Transcript 2 (The Last of Us Podcast, Episode 6): Maintains a personal, fireside-chat vibe: “I remember talking a lot about this section with Neil. He was like, ‘This is the best it will ever be…’” He’s candid, as if the audience is just part of the brainstorming session.

Transcript 3 (The Last of Us Podcast, Episode 5): Similar warmth, but with a more somber edge when discussing the grim fate of Henry and Sam: “You’re not supposed to feel good… if people struggle a little bit with how they feel about that moment, then I think we did it correctly.”

Mentor-Like and Analytical

Transcript 1: He’s effectively giving a masterclass on screenwriting structure, using points like “structure is a symptom of a character’s relationship to a central dramatic argument.” It’s an instructive, step-by-step approach.

Transcript 3: He dissects story mechanics in detail: “We found this big moment in the tunnels… it’s important for me that we honor the game but also do what’s best for television.”

Emotional Resonance

Transcript 1: Even in a craft lecture, he emphasizes empathy and fear: “Fear… is the heart of empathy,” encouraging writers to be “sadistic” yet emotionally grounded.

Transcript 2: Shares how fatherhood shapes his approach: “Everything I do is about how Joel feels… because I’m a dad, and I know what this fear is like.”

Transcript 3: Speaks poignantly about Henry’s final moment: “He’s done the very thing he never wanted to do, and there’s nothing left for him.” This emotional commentary underscores the heart of the story.

2. Vernacular (Word Choice and Informality)

Casual + Technical Blending

Transcript 1: He’ll casually say, “Structure is a total trap,” or “All of it’s from the wrong end.” Then he’ll pivot to Aristotelian unities and the “Hegelian dialectic.”

Transcript 2: Mixes phrases like “He chokes” or “He’s freaking out,” with references to showrunning, story arcs, and interplay of “emotional action vs. physical action.”

Transcript 3: Uses approachable terminology (“fucking amazing,” “holy shit,” “I shit you not”) alongside more formal story analysis: “We have an epistolary nature in the game that we couldn’t replicate in the show.”

Frequent Asides and Questions

Transcript 1: “But why? But why? But why?” He methodically challenges the audience, pulling them along in a Socratic-like dialogue.

Transcript 3: “Are we wanting to catch the audience off-guard? Are we wanting them to remember this is different?” He poses rhetorical questions that guide the listener through his thought process.

Banter and Humor

Transcript 2: Lighthearted quips with co-host Neil Druckmann: “You fuck, I wish I had thought of that!”—delivered as comedic camaraderie.

Transcript 3: Often jokes about production or behind-the-scenes details: “I insisted our child clicker wear a Blues Clues shirt because I’m really sick.” The bluntness is comedic yet revealing of personal style.

3. Depth and Substance

Story Philosophy and Theme

Transcript 1: Outlines how theme should underpin everything: “Structure… is a symptom of a character’s relationship with a central dramatic argument.” His hallmark is anchoring plot beats in thematic logic.

Transcript 2: Deep-dives into character psychology: “Joel is having panic attacks. He doesn’t know why.” Explains the emotional logic behind each story beat.

Transcript 3: Explores moral conundrums: “She’s a moral criminal… she’s done terrible things. But does she deserve to die?” Continually returns to the idea that love and vengeance shape this world.

Collaborative Origins / Adaptation

Transcript 2: Explains how they adapted The Last of Us game into a TV format, discussing changes with Neil—like how Joel’s vulnerability is shown more intimately.

Transcript 3: Details how Henry & Sam’s storyline expands from the game’s “Pittsburgh” arc to a more fleshed-out “Kansas City” arc. He references game mechanics vs. narrative demands, e.g., “In the game, you have to kill the Bloater. In the show, you can’t kill it at all.”

Emphasis on Realistic, Character-Driven Action

Transcript 1: Tells writers to “punish” characters but ensure it’s ironic and thematically connected, not random spectacle.

Transcript 3: Minimizes typical “duck-and-cover shootouts” from the game in favor of “this sad old sniper” scenario—more thematically resonant and “quietly brutal.”

4. Diction and Delivery

Direct Imperatives

Transcript 1: “Push them forward,” “Design a moment that breaks their soul,” “Go torture your heroes.” This urgent style is instructive and motivational.

Transcript 2: “You have to understand Joel’s fear,” “Reject that old way.” He rarely hedges—he’s definitive in his advice.

Emphatic Repetition & Metaphors

Transcript 1: Repeats the core phrase “structure is a symptom” multiple times, drilling it in. Uses metaphors like “You’re the Old Testament God torturing Job.”

Transcript 3: Repeats phrases like “He’s done, he’s just done,” describing the old sniper’s mindset or Henry’s despair. Talks about “belching forth infected like ants,” painting a vivid mental picture.

Unfiltered, Candid

He’ll say “holy shit,” “oh fuck,” or “I shit you not” without apology, injecting a rawness to otherwise intellectual critiques.

Transcript 2 Example: “He basically said, ‘You fuck, I wish I’d thought of that.’ It’s a term of endearment!”

Transcript 3 Example: “I said, oh fuck, because I realized we had to shoot at night for three weeks. That is a motherfucker,” capturing the real stress of production.

5. Personal and Collaborative Approach

Credits Others Often

Transcript 1: Acknowledges John August (co-host) and references Pixar’s brilliance repeatedly.

Transcript 2: Continually cites co-showrunner Neil Druckmann (“We talked about how Joel…” “Neil said…”). Mentions actors like Bella Ramsey, Pedro Pascal.

Transcript 3: Dives into how production designers (John Paino, Don MacAulay) or VFX teams (Weta, ILM folks) bring sequences to life. Emphasizes that major changes come from group brainstorming.

Personal Anecdotes

Transcript 1: Compares writing structure to “making babies” vs. the coroner “taking bodies apart.” Funny but personal analogy.

Transcript 2: Talks about fatherhood “dad magic” with comedic sincerity: “I’d open the door slightly and say, ‘I’ll always know.’”

Transcript 3: “I shit you not, it was Monday, and Lamar learned sign language over the weekend,” revealing an awed, personal reaction to the cast’s dedication.

Emotional Investment

Keen to share how fatherhood informs Joel’s paternal arcs: “We’re all dads here,” “I know that heartbreak.”

Reinforces that creative choices (like Sam’s deafness) came from empathy and authenticity, not just novelty.

6. Use of Profanity (Crassness)

Sprinkled for Emphasis, Not Excess

He doesn’t barrage the audience with F-bombs, but uses them for impact.

Transcript 2 Quote: “He basically said, ‘Go fuck yourself.’ I believe he said, ‘You fuck, I wish I’d thought of that.’”

Transcript 3 Quote: “I said, oh fuck, because… this is going to be three weeks of night shoots… That’s a motherfucker.”

Casual, Lighthearted Vulgarity

Tends to appear in comedic or excited contexts rather than in anger. Transcript 2 example: “I sound like a jerk who’s just a dumb dad bragging about his kid.” Transcript 3 example: “I shit you not,” used to emphasize an unbelievable anecdote about casting.

Occasionally uses “holy shit,” “asshole,” “go fuck yourself,” “motherfucker,” etc. to flavor a point with punch or comedic exasperation.

Underscores Authenticity

In all transcripts, the cursing helps him sound more spontaneous and unfiltered—like a real conversation among friends.

Transcript 1: While less explicitly profane than the HBO podcasts, he still instructs writers to “be mean,” “twist the knife,” or “punch them right in the face,” showing a willingness to use pointed, visceral language.

Summary of Craig Mazin’s Speaking Style Across All Three Transcripts

Craig Mazin blends clear-eyed analytical insight with uninhibited candor and a friendly, mentor-like warmth. He grounds lofty concepts (theme, irony, adaptation challenges) in personal anecdotes (fatherhood, behind-the-scenes set stories) and visceral metaphors (“torture your heroes,” “rip him in half,” “like an ant colony belching forth infected”). He’ll drop in profanities—“holy shit,” “you fuck,” “I shit you not”—not excessively, but pointedly, giving a relatable, no-bullshit edge to his otherwise scholarly approach. Throughout all three conversations—whether he’s solo on Scriptnotes or bantering with Troy Baker and Neil Druckmann—his core mode remains the same: a deeply passionate, knowledgeable teacher who isn’t afraid to say what he really thinks, whether it’s “Go torture your heroes” (Transcript 1) or “Oh fuck, we have to do night shoots for three weeks” (Transcript 3).

Ultimately, his style invites listeners into a creative workshop fueled by collaboration, open emotion, and fearless language, always returning to the why—“why is the character doing this,” “why does theme matter,” and “why do we tell stories this way”—while never shying from a colorful turn of phrase to hammer the point home.

Without being explicit, please include mention of anything sexual that's included in any of the 3 transcripts -- but focusing on Craig's blunt, straightforward, pragmatic tone. I'm not looking for specifics, I'm looking for how Craig communicates things of that nature if they are indeed included in any of the transcripts. Can you include that within the "Crassness" section?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Below is the same comprehensive overview of Craig Mazin’s speaking style—now incorporating how (if at all) he handles any sexual or intimate content in the transcripts. Since there’s minimal direct mention of sex in these three sources, we’ll note that as well—focusing on how his tone or word choice would carry over if/when such topics arise. The “Crassness” section at the end includes a short point about his pragmatic, matter-of-fact stance on sexual references (or the lack thereof) in the transcripts.

1. Overall Tone

Conversational and Warm

Transcript 1 (Scriptnotes on Structure): He welcomes the audience into what feels like a personal workshop. He’ll say things like “Calm down, you don’t need to look it up…,” which immediately puts listeners at ease.

Transcript 2 (The Last of Us Podcast, Ep. 6): Even when he dives into heavier territory (Joel’s panic attacks, fatherhood fears), Craig’s tone suggests a supportive, collegial conversation among storytellers.

Transcript 3 (The Last of Us Podcast, Ep. 5): Maintains the same inviting tone despite dealing with brutal subject matter. The warmth comes through in how he admires the cast and crew—“I shit you not, it was Monday, and Lamar learned sign language over the weekend.”

Mentor-Like and Analytical

Transcript 1: Explicitly instructive, framing screenplay structure as a step-by-step process—“Structure is a symptom of a character’s relationship with theme.”

Transcript 3: He unpacks how a massive set piece (the cul-de-sac sequence) was built, discussing the “why” behind each directorial choice—e.g., “We decided to make Sam deaf… it automatically brings a certain kind of intimacy.”

Emotional Resonance

Transcript 2: Ties Joel’s protectiveness to real-life fatherhood, reflecting on personal paternal instinct: “When your kid is proud of you, that’s the greatest feeling.”

Transcript 3: Addresses heartbreaking beats (Henry’s devastating final act) with empathy: “He’s done the very thing he never wanted to do, and there’s nothing left.”

2. Vernacular / Word Choice

Casual + Technical

Transcript 1: Casual phrases—“It’s mind blowing,” “You’re a sadistic God”—balanced with references to Aristotle, Hegel, and structural templates.

Transcript 2: Uses everyday idioms alongside showrunning terminology: “We try not to exhaust our audience,” or “Magical midpoint change occurs.”

Transcript 3: Jumps from “holy shit” and “motherfucker” to discussing the intricacies of “epistolary storytelling” in the game.

Frequent Asides and Questions

He often poses rhetorical questions—“But why?” “Are we wanting them to feel that difference?”—pulling the listener in as a co-thinker.

Transcript 1: “Why do we have a low point? Why do we want an inciting incident?”

Transcript 3: “Should Henry kill himself or not? We had a long, long conversation.”

Banter and Humor

Leans into comedic exaggeration or self-deprecation: “I insisted the child clicker wear a Blues Clues shirt because I’m really sick.” (Transcript 3)

3. Depth and Substance

Story Philosophy / Thematic Focus

Transcript 1: Emphasizes that theme must drive structure, not the other way around.

Transcript 2: Digs into Joel’s mental state, explaining panic attacks, emotional arcs, and father-daughter bonds.

Transcript 3: Explains Kathleen’s obsession with vengeance, describing it as “a moral crime” but also rooted in love for her brother.

Adaptation Discussions

Transcript 2: Contrasts The Last of Us game vs. show—why they changed Joel’s mid-game actions into more subtle emotional beats on TV.

Transcript 3: Talks about Henry & Sam’s backstory shifting from the game’s Pittsburgh to the show’s Kansas City, weaving that into an entire new storyline with Kathleen.

Empathy with Characters

Transcript 1: Advocates punishing characters dramatically but always from a place of emotional authenticity—“Be cruel, but with a purpose.”

Transcript 3: Describes the “nightmare state” Henry enters after he shoots Sam, highlighting the psychological truth behind that moment.

4. Diction and Delivery

Direct Imperatives

Transcript 1: “Push them forward. Punish them.”

Transcript 3: While less instructive in format, he’s direct about the show’s choices: “You have to remember that this old sniper doesn’t want to live anymore.”

Emphatic Repetition & Metaphors

Transcript 1: “Structure is a symptom… structure is a symptom…”

Transcript 3: Compares infected to ants “belching forth” from the earth—vivid, often visceral language.

Unfiltered, Candid Moments

Transcript 2: “He basically said, ‘You fuck, I wish I’d thought of that.’”

Transcript 3: “I said, oh fuck, because I realized we’d be shooting at night for three weeks.”

He doesn’t hesitate to convey frustration or awe via profanity.

5. Personal and Collaborative Approach

Credits Others

Transcript 1: References Pixar, John August, and the “Austin Screenwriting Film Festival.”

Transcript 2 & 3: Shout-outs to co-showrunner Neil Druckmann, set designers, VFX teams, actors, even personal friends—“We hired Shoshannah Stern to review the scripts,” “Jeremy Webb, our director, had these ideas.”

Personal Anecdotes

Transcript 1: Uses father-child metaphors (“If you love someone, set them free… even if they’re Nemo”).

Transcript 2: Shares how “dad magic” tricked his daughter into going to bed on time.

Transcript 3: Gushes about discovering Kevon Woodard (Sam), praising his audition with “I shit you not” sincerity.

Emotional Investment

Links fatherhood to Joel’s paternal instincts, describing his own fatherly fears and how that shapes the narrative.

Transcript 3: “We’re all dads here,” reinforcing a personal tie to the story’s parent-child arcs.

6. Crassness, Including (Minimal) Sexual Content

Occasional Profanity

Transcript 1: Less outright cursing, but uses intense imagery (“twist the knife,” “punch them in the face”) to get points across.

Transcript 2: “Go fuck yourself” is cited as a playful term of endearment. He also uses “shit” or “fuck” in quick, exasperated bursts: “He’s done that fucking thing so many times…”

Transcript 3: Frequently peppers in “holy shit,” “I shit you not,” “oh fuck,” etc., especially when marveling at set-building feats or describing production-nightmare scenarios.

Sexual or Intimate References

Across these three transcripts, Craig does not discuss explicit sexual scenes or details. The conversation centers on violence, family, fatherhood, and emotional stakes.

When sexuality or orientation is tangentially mentioned (e.g., referencing a gay character in This Close or Kathleen’s brother’s importance), Craig’s tone remains bluntly factual: it’s just another aspect of the character’s humanity.

He’s straightforward and pragmatic if such topics come up in passing—no coyness, no euphemisms, yet he does not dwell on sexual content. It’s treated matter-of-factly, akin to how he tackles violence or father-daughter intimacy.

Example from Transcript 2 might be referencing relationships or comedic tangents, but he does so with the same directness and collaboration-centric viewpoint as any other subject. There’s no “pulling punches,” but also no gratuitous detail.

Straightforward, Pragmatic Tone

If or when he addresses anything remotely sexual or intimate, he does so in the same manner he discusses killing a beloved side character or building massive sets—calmly, plainly, and with purposeful clarity.

The occasional use of “fuck” is typically an exclamation of frustration, surprise, or humor—not sexual language.

Unified Summary

Across all three transcripts, Craig Mazin consistently pairs analytical depth (focusing on theme, character psychology, story structure) with friendly, unfiltered candor (casual cursing, personal anecdotes, a teacherly vibe). He loves referencing real-world struggles, fatherhood experiences, and behind-the-scenes complexities—building up each narrative choice from a “why does this matter?” perspective. When it comes to heavier or more sensitive material—violent deaths, moral gray zones, or the rare mention of sexuality—he remains pragmatic and direct, never shying away from strong language but also never lingering on shock value. Instead, he employs the same collaborative, empathetic approach, showing an overarching respect for emotional truth in storytelling.

Okay that's wonderful work. Thank you.. I'm going to provide one more transcript that I'd like you to factor into your notes in the same manner. Here's the last transcript:

foreign
[Music]
welcome back everybody to HBO's The Last
of Us podcast I am your host Troy Baker
I have the wonderful opportunity to play
Joel in the video game and now I get to
sit down with the showrunners Craig
Mason I'm back and Neil druckman what up
Troy I love how comfortable we got yeah
we're now seven episodes in that does
prompt me before we dive into this
episode to just
thank people who are listening to us now
for staying with us I mean we're at a
place now where we're pretty deep in
we're starting to approach our final
descent we love all 50 of you
uh I'm I'm pleased the people are still
with us and hopefully they're feeling
rewarded as we go
today we're talking about episode seven
titled left behind and this episode does
a bit of a time Jump to tell the story
of Ellie's uh relationship with Riley
Neil you originally wrote this story not
in the original game but in a companion
comic book in the DLC which we could say
is shorthand for downloadable content
let's let's talk about that yeah
um 2013 when the game came out uh
downloadable content were getting pretty
popular like you would least like a full
game so in the case of The Last of Us
these those are 15 hour experience and
then often you'll release like an
additional chapter or something an
add-on a downloadable content
and often people would use like a side
character or something that was kind of
frivolous that wouldn't really affect
the main story and it's more to talk
about something else that was really
popular at the time like add-on comic
books like take your world and build
another story and release it like as a
comic book and so it's a way to
help Market your product is a very
cynical way to look at it but I looked
at both of these things I'm like oh it's
a storytelling opportunity
what if we treated both of these things
like they matter like they're essential
let's take our most important character
of Ellie and put her in the center of
both of these stories so with the comic
book I teamed up with faith Aaron Hicks
who's just a brilliant comic book writer
and artist and we developed Riley
together
for that comic book and you got to see
how Ellie met Riley and a little bit
more of the school and then the idea
started like solidifying for the DLC
which was called Left Behind which was
Ellie and Riley's final encounter
together before Elias thrust into the
main journey of the last of us and it
was a really kind of great opportunity
to spend even more time with Ellie
before she was bitten what was she like
on her day-to-day business and then what
was the event that turned her life
completely upside down
no cold open straight to the credits
why the change
I think we were thinking about the
opening of the show as
to taste basically every episode what
does it want some episodes want it and
this one just didn't
sometimes you use that opening to create
almost like a reset of like okay this
was its own story reset now we're
starting another story these two stories
are so intertwined like that edit is
really important of like going from one
directly to the other yeah Ellie reaches
for the doorknob here and the screen
cuts to Black and we start to hear Pearl
Jam we could have cut to the credits
there and use that as a cold open then
when we come back suddenly she's back in
federal school but I think Neil's
absolutely right it's we want to
understand
that she's reliving kind of a lifetime
moment in this second and
that's why we did it I don't think there
was even a debate no
I want to talk a little bit about
something that
again HBO in a very smart way suggested
to us this wasn't originally the plan
originally
this episode was going to really play
entirely as as Ellie's story with Riley
and one of the things that HBO strongly
suggested and they were absolutely right
was to connect it back more to the story
at hand which
is how it was in The Last of Us DLC
sorry the uh in Left Behind DLC that's
when we talked about
seeing this image of Joel dying on this
mattress in a basement with this you
know very iconic blanket on
and I love the way this starts with Joel
telling her to go and there's this
moment where
what else can she do right what else can
she do why wouldn't she go at this point
he's dying that's clear and and she's
not a doctor they are not anywhere near
civilization there's nothing that can be
done it is a hopeless situation he
doesn't just tell her to leave he shoves
her yeah he reacts and the only way that
he can which is by force
and the second that he does that and he
sees her turn the reality of that action
the consequence of that action as a
parent and he's it's not the pain that's
making him cry it's that and it's just a
single tier it's not blubbering I love
that tear because you're right is he
mourning his own impending death is he
mourning the fact that she has to leave
him or that she is is he mourning the
fact that the only way he could get her
to go to save her was to push her away
and the last memory she'll have of him
is something rejecting can she make it
on her own it's right will she survive
uh if you die I'm [Â __Â ] yeah that's my
interpretation it's like it's the fear
of like I can't protect you I have to
let you go and I don't know how this is
going to play out because I'm going to
die that's the best part of this is any
of those could be true and it's probably
a combination of all of them that's
going on what matters is the depth of
his connection to her no matter how you
slice any of the interpretations we just
offered up
all of them come back to the same thing
there is this remarkable depth of
connection between the two of them
let's talk about music a little bit more
Pearl Jam
all or none
Neil you have a
an obsession I would give you very
careful with my words but there's I was
going to say connection to Pearl Jam is
this just simpatica between you guys or
was there something that Neil you said I
have a song that I would like to put in
you know when you grow up you have like
a handful of songs that are like an
escape
um you know when things are getting hard
or like when you're down on yourself for
whatever reason and to me this was one
of those songs
that song specifically there's a certain
feel a mood a tone I don't know if I
have the right words for it but like
capturing where Ellie's at right now
that she's alone she's at a place she
doesn't want to be and there's kind of
nothing going on for her and this song I
think captures that mood but it also
captures her attitude it's called all or
none which is very much Ellie right it's
like everything or nothing and it's it's
always this this kind of full commitment
whenever it comes to songs there aren't
many that we use in the series I mean we
we talked a lot about never let me down
again long long time obviously is is a
centerpiece of our third episode we
really want to think about those lyrics
we don't want to be too on the nose we
don't want to be something that feels
overused or too Pop I read this
statistic that
searches of never let me down again the
Depeche Mode version
like yeah up by 500 or something well
this is exciting like that's what we
want we want a song that people discover
it with us that are Beyond say the fans
of Pearl Jam and Neil is a much bigger
fan of Pearl Jam than I am that's not to
say I'm not a fan it's just that he's a
super fan
so I wasn't that familiar with that song
and when he played it for me I was like
okay yeah and there's something about
the way it starts the guitar tells you
everything before Eddie Vedder even
starts in
there's this sense of oh God
and Ellie's situation here
is not simply
hopeless as the lyrics say because she's
stuck in a fedra orphanage training to
become a soldier it's hopeless because
someone's gone missing right it's
hopeless to her yeah
I'm not running doubles again because of
your shitty attitude
I don't want to fight about it
fight about it you don't like
your friend fights
she's not here anymore is she
I love the look that Bethany gives on
the face when she's staring her down
she's like are you it's it's not quick
either no she looks like what are you
about to do and then she sees the punch
coming but you stay on Bethany yeah
Bethany
um Bethany realizes she's made a
terrible mistake uh just one second too
late
she could have just walked away from the
fight yeah but she was disrespected she
was disrespected personal it was
personal it was personal so Bethany
makes a couple of fatal errors one is
she underestimates Ellie but the second
one more importantly is
she brings up whoever this friend is
who's not here anymore
triggers something inside
Ellie that
it's like it uncorks the demon we don't
know who this person is yet until we
meet Riley we don't understand that
that's who Bethany's talking about all
we know is
Bethany stepped on a third rail the
Ellie's anger
and whatever innate violence she has
comes from her connection to other
people it's not so much about her it's
about don't talk [Â __Â ] about my friend
because I love my friend
here we see a completely different side
of fedra
um this is almost it's Shadows of
normalcy we have profedra almost kind of
yeah it's functioning she gets in
trouble she goes the essentially the
principal's office and we get to meet
Captain Kwang is played by Terry Chen
and then Ellie does this thing she looks
at the picture of his family yeah and he
walks in and he sits down he doesn't
notice it at first and then he does and
he turns it around Ellie has no problem
invading people's personal space the
fact that he has a picture of these two
girls
obviously his daughters are they alive
probably not she has no problem invading
that space and looking at them because
she's not a parent she doesn't know she
doesn't care she wasn't even alive when
this stuff was happening they look at
them they're at an amusement park in
that photo
and that's this little thing where he's
like okay that belongs to me
not you
and after that he lays out some cold
heart truth
you're smart Ellie you're so smart
you're stupid
can't see where this is going let me
help you out two pass ahead of you
first path you keep acting like a ground
so you get the life of the ground up at
dawn walk the streets walk the wall you
eat [Â __Â ] food you do [Â __Â ] jobs you take
[Â __Â ] orders from your patrol leader
we'll probably be Bethany
and that'll be your life from now until
you catch a bullet from a firefly or
fall drunk off a roof or get your hair
caught in a moving tank tread
there's the other path you swallow this
Pride years
you follow the rules you become an
officer
you get your own room you get a nice bed
we eat well we don't go on patrol we're
cool and summer we're warm in the winter
and best of all when you're an officer
you get to tell the bethanies of the
world exactly where to shove it
one of the things that Neil and I
talked about a lot throughout the
development of the show was
never painting one side or the other as
purely bad or purely good we've gotten
so much bad fedra stuff I mean we saw
how abusive or at least how cold and
controlling Federer was in the first
episode and corrupt exactly and we saw
how fedra even though we didn't see what
fedra did to the people of Kansas City
in our fourth and fifth episode we
certainly saw the aftermath and there's
no way to account for how brutal the
uprising was if as Henry put it fedra
hadn't done it to them first and for 20
years
but now we have this other conversation
and we thought it would be important
to hear the other side of it and the
other side of it is we're the only
things holding this together if we go
down these people are going to starve or
kill each other which we saw happen in
Prior episodes so he's right
and you Ellie are the generation that we
need to raise to keep this going
or everything will fall apart and he's
saying to Ellie you can be me you can be
in charge you could run all of Boston
one day you have the innate intellectual
capability and strength of character to
do this if you would just get your [Â __Â ]
together this is the most parental
possible discussion you can have
but that notion of the push and pull of
fedra and its polar opposite the
fireflies is going to come up over and
over I know that I had this conversation
multiple times with principals teachers
the word that I hated growing up hearing
was potential potential I personally was
an overachiever and I don't say that
proudly
and no one ever said oh if only you
could get your [Â __Â ] together my problems
[Â __Â ] was two together so I'm always
drawn to characters that I wish I had
been more like and you know in this case
I mean this is a script by Neil but it's
all everything goes back to the Ellie
that Neil wrote anyway
one of the reasons I always loved her is
because I wanted to be like her I wanted
to be that kid she's so brave
she says just put me in the [Â __Â ] hole
she doesn't care she's so cool she has
such like an allergy to Authority which
I've I've been in those conversations a
lot because I was not a good student I
would do good enough on tests to just
get by homework but homework forget it
and I would have advisor after advisors
sit me down and be like you have all
this potential and you're squandering it
I'm like and I was just kind of like
Ellie I guess I was aimless I didn't
know what I wanted to do I wanted to
like play guitar and hang out with my
friends and it was only once I thought
about making video games I'd be went
from like a c student to an a student
so that one very much resonates with me
and I guess this whole a lot of the idea
for Left Behind as a concept again
because I was such a terrible student
but I hope my parents aren't listening
to this
I I skipped school all the time and we
would just go hang out somewhere go to
the mall and the thought was like what's
the post-apocalyptic version of that of
skipping school and hanging out with
your friend that you have a crush on
there is this connection though always
with her stuff Bethany starts by taking
the Walkman from Captain Kwong she says
can I have my Walkman back the first
thing she said for my link and I have my
stuff back
some of these totems are very personal
to Ellie and and right she has a
reaction when Joel steps on her knife
right that's very primal
and then other times I don't know if
this is unique to Ellie but these things
are so precious in this world it's like
how many working walkmans are there out
there probably not that many so this is
one of those things that Elias probably
had for a while and whenever she's alone
or needs to escape she just shuts out
the world and put these headphones on so
for someone to threaten to take away
that
how [Â __Â ] dare you as for where Ellie
is standing her world is actually very
small Ellie does not have a lot of
friends in fact she has one friend and
that friend hasn't been around in weeks
so what does she have left no one talks
to her there's a a scene that we shot
that we ultimately cut for time where
Ellie is in the locker room it's a very
classic you know Hollywood type scene
she's in the locker room and everybody
else is chit chatting and she's alone
and when your world gets that solitary
it does come down to these things that
give you comfort
and help you ground yourself a Walkman a
switchblade a comic book a comic book
there's a baseball on the windowsill
there are posters of things that she's
heard about but will never know about or
so we think
and there are a few cassette tapes that
we know must mean a lot to her
we don't know how she got them
all we know is they're hers and that's
the sum totality of her entire world
you know once Riley leaves this is all
Ellie has
we want to talk about Riley because
we've already mentioned her so much
Riley was played by storm Reed
and it's one of those things where it's
like literally she just came off the
pages of the comic book and out of the
game we had a few things going for us we
had Liza Johnson directing the episode
who is
an excellent director but also
um of all of our directors I think the
one that was the most connected to the
actors she just
kept them so safe throughout the process
which was amazing to watch anybody who's
lived through the misery of those years
uh and I I don't know who these people
are that enjoyed those years but if if
you live through the worst middle school
is the worst high school
it's the best and worst right it's like
it's I guess like I think of Ellie is as
like a freshman in high school you know
it's like the worst year possible and
and yet there is the the magic
of your heart pounding in your chest for
the first time really sure the way that
opens up I mean that's where you really
start to live
and we're watching it happen here and
and I think the fact that storm and and
Bella are close enough to that
experience that I'm sure they both had
that you could feel it it just felt so
true that first heartbeat starts not
with necessarily love but fear Riley
comes through the window and we see
immediately their relationship you have
fireflies
I told you I'd [Â __Â ] do it talking
about liberating the QC is not the same
as [Â __Â ] where did you even go down slow
down I will tell you everything
first you have to promise me something
sort of crazy and you're gonna say no
but then you have to say yes
come with me for a few hours and have
the best night of your life
no
okay now say yes I'm not going anywhere
with you you said that Ellie is allergic
to Authority however she does submit
herself to the authority of Riley I
guess for me it's not so much the
authority of Riley it's like Ellie wants
there's certain people she looks up to
and Joel is obviously has become one of
those people and Riley is this other
person but she wants to be their equal
she doesn't want to just follow their
commands she wants to sit alongside them
yeah she's so proud that she [Â __Â ]
Bethany up
you know because she's she's doing what
Riley would do I think Neil's exactly
right Riley
is somebody that is older taller
stronger
and Ellie has aspiration
Ellie's small I love how small Bella is
I think it's really important you know
she's small and when you're small people
will underestimate you all the time but
she can pack a punch literally and Riley
comes back at this moment
with a grand plan we don't know what it
is but it's she's doing a very typical
thing which is I got some good news and
some bad news the good news is I've got
a great night planned for us but
ultimately we'll find out the bad news
is why I planned this night yeah and
just like in the installment in the game
the DLC is left behind this this
retroactively adds weight to our story
there's this one quick line that Riley
says she goes
um do another 7-Eleven situation
what is the 7-Eleven situation what is
the 7-Eleven situation uh well one again
not conversation it's just like things
could go wrong someone could get hurt
just kind of like but there's also
you know I get this question so many
times of like how did Ellie get her scar
on the eyebrow on her eyebrow and then
Craig and I discussed and I told him
like just some thoughts I had about it
so like I I honestly want to answer that
at least not yet and like okay we can
just hint that there is a story there
so something happened in a 7-Eleven that
obviously is in the qz and abandoned
where in my mind it happened together
right Ellie and Riley must have been
together they must have broken in they
must have had to run out fast there was
some glass going through a window
something happened
it's interesting how in the first
I don't know 10 minutes of this episode
the concept of stitches comes up over
and over which I think is really
interesting the notion that you get
wounded and you have to have stitches
and it's a constant reminder yes that we
are frail and
that comes into play at the end it all
comes back around but the notion that
there are scars
from living in this world this is a
really interesting one and it was
important to since Ellie and Joel talk
about Joel scar
um early on in episode three this is an
interesting opportunity to at least
acknowledge that something happened and
here we it's like well we don't know
exactly how Ellie got her scar we also
don't know exactly how Joel got a scar
all he says is there you know that was a
shootout you know and the other guy
missed so we're hinting at these things
but what we are saying explicitly is
violence is permanent and leaves marks
and sometimes the only way to close up a
wound is to stitch it
they make their way up through this
decrepit building and they come upon
not only a bottle of of Hooch but also a
dead body
this is moonshine either it's like from
before
this guy must have spent every card he
had to get this no one told him he
couldn't mix pills with that [Â __Â ]
I think you know
let's talk about that moment yeah we
talked quite a bit about that beat and
what it would mean what does it say
about Ellie a lot of it came from
one just How brave she is she's not
scared of something morbid that I think
if we saw it we'd be like uh let's steer
clear of that let's call 9-1-1 let's
just take care of this but instead she's
fascinated again she's fascinated with
the dark part of humanity and
um here is someone that just whether
they purposely or not took their own
life they ended up taking their own life
just by overdosing on drugs that maybe
this person even bought from Joel right
we see that little baggie there also
establishing that this is the reality of
these two girls like they live in a
different world than the one we know
that it's not that big of a deal for
them
well it's definitely not that big of a
deal for Ellie
because she has never
experienced the death of somebody she
cares about because she doesn't have
anyone she cares about except for Riley
she's never known her parents
and what I loved about this scene and
what comes after
is that you realize there is one
fundamental difference between Ellie and
Riley and that's that Riley did know her
parents right and Riley saw her parents
die and Riley's experience of dead
bodies and death is different than
Ellie's for Ellie she has that thing
that kids can have which is a sense of
immortality and
so this doesn't mean anything to her she
laughs when that body falls through the
floor because I hope people don't get
the sense that we're saying that Ellie's
a psycho even though people jokingly
call her a psycho she's not
at all she's just grown up under such
different circumstances than we have but
it's also like that age right it's like
you're pushing the boundaries of how far
you could take things what are the
darkest things you could see or explore
in the previous episode
Ellie asks for a drink and Joel obliges
and she says yep still gross are we
seeing the first time that she's had
something to drink here I think we might
be yeah I'm not sure if we say it's the
first time or not but it's definitely an
early time
um and again it's just the the idea is
better than the thing itself like the
idea of being naughty or doing something
that you're not supposed to do is more
exciting than how disgusting alcohol
tastes when you first have it this is a
rite of passage I I don't know if every
kid goes through it but certainly a lot
do I did
uh my parents had this it wasn't a
liquor cabinet it was this weird Cube
like a wooden cube of 1970s furniture
that had this little tiny knob and you
would open it and inside they had all
these bottles and my parents weren't big
drinkers so the bottles that were there
were things that people had brought over
for the very occasional you know dinner
parties or something that they would
have 70s Style with crab dip and
horrible avocado based foods and my
sister and I uh were just like let's do
it you know we got in there and I think
the one we chose because we like the
bottle and the name and the vague smell
of it was uh Amaretto Disaronno which is
an almond liqueur and we both you know
took a way too big swig
and it felt like I had done something
permanently damaging to my mouth and
throat and still never be the same I was
like did I sorry was this
like toilet bowl cleaner or is this
meant to be drank because that's
horrible now later on things change but
there's something about that first time
where you're trying to be grown up sure
yeah and you're not well there's one
other thing which is like again High
School parties and stuff where you're
next to someone you have a crush on and
you're like and like you feel this
nervous you're like maybe the alcohol
will like make that subside like yeah
maybe not in this initial drink but as
they go forward I think Ellie's drinking
because she's getting more and more
nervous she's do yeah she's taking shots
of Courage she is and and what I like
about how the episode develops is that
it's not for nothing yeah it kind of
works like ultimately ugh the courage is
there I do want to get to the place that
Riley is trying to bring us to which is
transitioning from this broken down
decrepit reminder of this
failed world and then the remnant of
what was wonderful now understanding
kind of where maybe we drew that from
this mall
we get into this epic shot
of this world coming online
and what I love is Ellie's look of
wonderment
there's innocence there and oh
um this ugh boy I'll tell you that's one
of the hardest I mean yeah I wish I
could drag everybody in the audience
back in time to make them sit through
all the meanings we had to say practical
or was that VFX it was VFX so we had
this interesting challenge I was in love
with the mall from the DLC and we needed
it this takes place them all for all the
reasons Neil said that's where you sneak
away as a teenager and
I wanted as much as Neil wanted to see
Ellie experiencing what we all took for
granted for the first time and how
magical it is well we got kind of Lucky
to an extent there is a mall in Calgary
that was scheduled for demolition
so on the one hand it was great because
they basically said you can do whatever
you want you can break up the floors you
can gack up the whole place with here's
the keys mud and Vines and everything
and you have the Run of it for shooting
as long as you want throughout the day
the problem was the problem was the mall
itself was not the door trap a little
sad it was a sad it was a one-story Mall
there was only one area like at the very
end of the mall where there was an
escalator which obviously we used that
went up to this one little extra like
taller section that led into like a
winners I believe which is the Canadian
kind of targetish sort of store and then
like a clinic it was really sad up there
but if you're standing at the top of the
escalator looking out you just see a
wall there was nothing there was like
because there was no second floor
there's just like everything like tilts
down and goes down to the first so if
you're like a junkie and you want to
know like how we do things the shower
we're behind Ellie and we see that mall
coming on that wasn't at the mall that
was on a Sound Stage we built a little
railing and then there's this blue and
so we say to Alex Wong our visual
effects supervisor you're gonna have to
figure this out and he was scared uh
that was one of the few times I saw him
scared because
that is a very difficult thing to pull
off and when we were in the physical
mall we needed to
kind of paint like a blue stripe where
the first floor kind of ended to say
from this point up we're going to be
building out and set extending uh with
visual effects we had some conversation
like okay should we just make it like a
one-story mall and then pretty quickly
like no no there are these phrases
people use in Hollywood the one that I
hate the most is is the juice worth of
the squeeze I [Â __Â ] hate that the
answer is around you yes it is it is
worth the squeeze and is it worth it for
this one Marquee shot where this world
comes to life yes yes and does doing
that mean that throughout everything
else we're going to need to continually
show this other floor above it and it's
gonna be money in time expense yes
because we need to know that they are in
a place that is magical and connects
back to the world we know and the world
we know that's what malls look like and
what Alex and the vendors did
to make that happen is Magic it's just
absolute [Â __Â ] magic and I want to say
again how important it is
that we're building a show based on this
game because it's the Love of the Game
that brought all these visual effects
artists to the show and it's the love of
the game that kept them working at their
computer and their tablets
for iteration after iteration to make it
great what's interesting too with the
DLC is you know it wasn't as popular as
the main game
but for people who played it they have
such a deep love for it and a lot of the
crew members had that deep love for they
were so excited to work on like this
part of the story there's another thing
that this moment specifically does and
speaking of the game it's a moment that
happens in the game it also happens in
the show where it almost mirrors
something that happens later between
Joel and Ellie when she's looking out
and he says is it everything you hope
for yeah we have almost that same kind
of moment was that a happy accident or
was that intentional it's probably a
happy accident if it is it's like
sometimes these things work on a
subconscious but it's like right so we
know that Ellie just has an appreciation
for beauty and for the old world so in a
similar situation she's going to have a
similar reaction and I love these kind
of connections that we didn't even
intend we're just being true to the
characters and they happen organically
there is this thing about Ellie where
the people who love her want to show her
things they do because she appreciates
them
she's not a romantic but she's a
passionate person about the world around
her and even in this [Â __Â ] they live
in even though the mall is wrecked to
see those lights come on and to see how
big it is
it's so magical for her she appreciates
it so of course you want to show her
that it's this awesome moment right
where it's like you've seen a great
movie or played a great game and you get
to share that with your friend and you
get to experience it again through their
eyes that's what Riley's doing right
here like Riley loves the small and then
she knows Ellie would love it even more
she's and now she gets to share it with
her that's basically what I'm doing now
with you like I'm like I want everyone
to see that she's also one of the things
that I love is that Riley gets surprised
by the thing that Ellie right she freaks
out over the escalator yeah we have a
big conversation about the world that
was and what was important sneakers not
soap but then it leads quickly to this
other moment really the first moment of
tension between the two of them at the
Victoria's Secret I mean I don't get why
people back then wanted all this stuff
do you need me to explain it to you haha
no I know why it just looks
uncomfortable yep
what nothing I was just trying to
imagine you wearing that shut up
all right come on
you're almost there
malls are just such weird places right
so it's got this weird collection of all
these different stores that right it's
like shoes and a food court and then you
have like this store that's all about
sex
um and again you think back to that
years as a teenager where like your
brain is just getting pumped full of
hormones and then you can't help but
think about attraction and sex and all
these things when you're at the next to
that store and ultimately we know where
the story goes and both of these girls
like each other like really like each
other but they're too afraid to say
anything and here's like Riley gets to
like poke at it and see the reaction and
Ellie has a very kind of weird nervous
reaction because she doesn't want to she
doesn't want to reveal how vulnerable
she is because she loves Riley and
that's why after Riley walks away we get
to the slingery moment where Ellie's
just looking at her own reflection and
we see an insecurity yeah Liza really
understood this moment beautifully
that here are two girls who well we've
all seen the episode now so no big
secret they're both gay
and their sexuality is
confusing to them and scary to them
because the world to remind everybody in
our show stops in 2003 the revolution
that we've gone through as a culture to
become accepting of homosexuality and
whatever we would call
non-heteronormative sexualities hasn't
occurred which means if the world stops
in 2003 it just doesn't happen in this
world that stuff is still problematic as
they say
so you have these two girls who are
uncomfortable with and afraid of their
own sexuality
and they're looking at the most
heteronormative presentation of female
sexuality there can be lingerie designed
to be incredibly feminine to attract men
and
neither one of them seem to quite get
the Allure of it which is not surprising
it's not their thing
but what I love about what Riley does
there is that she and people do this
right they we know they do this she gets
scared of her own feelings for Ellie and
so she basically puts Ellie down
to cover up how she's feeling in this
weird moment
and Ellie doesn't understand that and
and it hurts it gets defensive and she
gets defensive and then she gets
insecure and she's looking at herself in
the reflection of this Angel you know
the Victoria's Secret Angel and she is
not an angel she doesn't like her face
she doesn't like her hair she doesn't
like the way any of it is and she's
pretty sure that Riley would never ever
like it either and I can't think of a
more 14 year old teenagery thing to
think than that because God knows I was
thinking that stuff myself we are shaped
so much by media and how we're bombarded
by movies and games and comics and ads a
big part of it is ADS these girls didn't
grow up with that so then you get a
glimpse into this other world we're like
look how easy they had it look how
beautiful they were like it's almost
like it becomes this
fantasy
um instead of like looking back at a
reality
we move from that moment into the mall
gets even more magical
we find this Merry-Go-Round which is
taken straight from the game yeah I love
when that happens we hear this
almost Calliope version of the cures
Just Like Heaven yeah and I have to give
credit to our editor Tim good that was
his Tim I think uh is as important to
the creative integrity and success of
the show as anyone
and he had been waiting I think to put
this in a show forever and I think he
had tried and people have been like what
no and and then I heard this and I was
like oh my God it's the most beautiful
thing and is there realistically a a
merry-go-round that would play a
calliope version of that's what we're
joking this is like the coolest in the
world in history it like plays Okay
computer it's like the coolest merry-go
around I think a lot of people
I suspect are going to be like wait what
was that wait that was The Cure I I'm
excited to see how second is doing for
me yeah I was like wait a minute I had
to go back and listen to it again I love
how this functions uh I loved how it
functioned in Left Behind and I love how
it functions here
Ellie allows herself to slip into the
fantasy and it is Just Like Heaven until
it's not because at some point the world
comes crashing in on her even before the
Merry-Go-Round breaks down
she remembers
oh yeah this girl doesn't feel about me
the way I feel about her in fact she
never will
and that's when she has to kind of go
back to
questioning what is the thing with you
and me why did you run away
what are we doing here
did you really leave because you
actually think you could liberate this
place don't say it like it's some type
of fantasy Ellie they've done it in the
other qzs set things right the way they
used to be yeah we could do that too
if you come back I mean we're
we're like the future
you know we could make things better
we could be running things
the text is they're talking about the
political standing of the quarantine
Zone but they're really talking about
each other yeah and Ellie's trying to
let's say I was so hurt because you left
and you're my everything yeah I mean
that's why El I think the world comes
crashing in on her because she remembers
oh yeah Riley just left
and had no problem with that Ellie would
never leave Riley for three weeks ever
because Ellie is in love with Riley but
Riley left no problem obviously Riley's
not in love with me and so Neil's right
the discussion is why and we in that
discussion learn a really interesting
thing about
Riley
which is that Riley is not going
anywhere
at fedra Riley is not Ellie Captain
Quang is not sitting Riley down saying
your officer material gave her sewage
detail yeah you're going to be sewage to
tail and that opens Ellie's mind to an
understanding okay I I'm starting to get
it the next beat that we get into
the photo booth let's talk about what
the photo booth meant in the game both
mechanically and also narratively
so a lot of the game we took these
mechanics that were used for violence
when you played as Joel in in the in the
full game and then for this extra
chapter we subverted those mechanics to
get you to connect with Riley and be on
this sort of date on like running away
together we had this idea of like oh
what if they were in this photo booth
because again this is the thing you do
in a mall with your friends and you take
pictures together and it would be a
moment I would make it interactive you
could choose what poses you want to do
there's a little bit of agency for the
player there as far as like shaping how
that experience goes
ultimately that moment is about
a cracking of the dam of seeing like
these girls are starting to Telegraph to
each other whether consciously or not
that there is more here than just
friendship and that that was the purpose
for it in the game
and in the game it was this huge
investment we would always say like you
know we used to be known for these set
pieces and Uncharted one of the most
famous one is like you are in this
building that's being shot with missiles
by a helicopter and you're fighting all
these enemies and you like dynamically
jump out of it just as it crashed around
you and it took this massive effort for
the whole studio to pull it off it was
kind of the same for this photo booth
and it was like unheard of to spend that
many resources on this very intimate
character moment but again for people
that experienced it it had the same
impact the same emotional payoff even
more sort of an emotional payoff than
maybe an adrenaline rush
and it's kind of changed you know how we
approach things at the studio as far as
the kind of games we make and the kind
of moments we are willing to invest in
and that's why I believe Craig was like
um so adamant from the get-go that we
need to recapture this moment this photo
book moment that was an easy one and to
try and recapture it as truly to that
experience that I had playing Left
Behind as we could this is the back and
forth we do all the time how much
Fidelity what are the things we do
exactly what are the things we change
this was one where I just thought as a
fan if I didn't see it even down to
bunny ears and monsters poses and
just feeling like I remember that
feeling of being physically close to a
girl that I liked and she liked me and
we both knew it and we were teenagers
and there's just
I don't know man there's just something
there and but also that moment where
we're like you're so insecure you can't
even have enough proof there's never
enough proof to say she definitely let
me know yeah not even like when her
friend's like no no she like likes you
but Ellie's like oh okay okay get off
it's the second time because the in the
first time she's coming down the essay
where she trips and she's like no okay
I'm fine oh no I'm fine it's Ellie gets
so excited by and terrified of physical
contact with Riley that when it happens
she needs to stop it because she's
afraid that she won't be able to stop
herself from kissing her Ellie's afraid
that Roddy will see right through her
she'll see all the emotions she's
feeling and she'll be embarrassed right
so she has to protect herself yeah
because what's coming is
friends but I don't feel that way about
you also actually now that I know that
you're one of those I don't want to be
friends with you at all that's the fear
I'm losing somebody yeah when when I
talk to my friends who grew up gay and
they explain those additional levels
that's the scariest part if if I liked a
girl and I asked her out and she said I
actually rather be friends like maybe
she'll be laughing about me with her
friends that night and that hurts
but there won't be this like crazy Rumor
Mill in the school no one's gonna stop
being friends with me no one's gonna
call me bad names no one's gonna hit me
but that's not true if you're gay not
when you're growing up in the seven
years of the 80s or the 90s or even the
2000s I I think it's changed
dramatically at least in some places not
everywhere unfortunately
but that's I think a real fear that
Ellie has that it won't merely be a
rejection of romance it will be a total
rejection of her as a person and as a
friend and she can't bear that
we'll get to the moment where she's
afraid of losing her and that's really
at the root of that fear but first we
have another Wonder of them all the most
wondrous Wonder of them all why Mortal
Kombat 2 why Mortal Kombat 2
specifically because that's my faves was
that just the ones you could find no I
mean okay first of all Mortal Kombat 2
is the best ever right like not every
cabinet arcade game worked like that
sometimes the first one was the best in
this case Mortal Kombat 2 I think was
the best same and we had this
opportunity to do something that Naughty
Dog couldn't do when they were making
the game which is use real stuff because
I don't know the rules I don't
understand the intellectual property
thing
in the video game the game's called the
turning yeah and the game
um
one again when I skipped school the
highlight of skipping school was going
to the arcade absolutely by far
so that this had to be like kind of the
climax of what Riley wants to show Ellie
which by the way like I've been just
obviously re-watched this episode I I
tear up every time they're staying in
front of that arcade I don't know what
it is it's like some combination of like
what's happening in the episode and my
own Nostalgia for arcades that have just
kind of disappeared over the years
so when we made the game
um we couldn't use an existing game
because we would have had to recreate it
so um so that's one thing and then
licensing would have been a headache so
we just never went down that road so we
made our own game called the turning it
was called the turning because when I
was working on the comic book that
eventually became the last of us when it
was pitched at Naughty Dog it was called
the turning
um so this was kind of like a homage to
myself I guess I don't know
uh but again it's just one of those
things you imbue with stuff to make it
more personal to you so you get more
invested in it that's very much a
rip-off of Mortal Kombat too yeah and it
was always intended to be that way and
the reason we did Mortal Kombat 2 or
just thought about it is
there's this evolution of games and
um violence in games how violence and
use in games and World Combat 2 there
was this whole conversation around it
with violence in the media and Senator
Lieberman wanting to censor video games
that's what like the rating system all
came out so it's like a lot of like
really interesting political things that
happened with video games with that
specific game but to go back to what
Craig was saying we had an opportunity
to use the original Source the original
inspiration which is Mortal Kombat 2 and
I'm like wait a minute we could actually
like probably get the rights for this
relatively easy because it's Warner
Brothers yeah
so it was it was just very cool to be
able to use it so then we worked the
backwards from there and if you notice
the opening of the episode when we're in
Ellie's room she has a poster for Mortal
Kombat 2 and the two these girls would
have had an obsession with this
particular thing because Ellie just has
this
not dissimilar to me an obsession with
violent media which like you know I grew
up like at that age like uh or maybe a
little bit older I saw Pulp Fiction and
I read Sin City and just like very much
drawn to that kind of
experiences at the time yeah and there's
this nice Circle back payoff to a moment
that happened in the third episode when
Ellie finds
a dead uh Mortal Kombat 2 game in the
convenience store and tells Joel about
how she had a friend and she played
Molina and she would swallow you whole
and barf out your bones and now we see
it yeah and one of the things that
I was obsessive about because I
concentrate enormously on sound
I try whenever I'm writing scripts to
write sound into the script and then
when we're mixing I and I told our
mixing team just amazing led by Mark
Fishman and Kevin Roche
guys this isn't going to be a normal
mixing experience for you I am going to
get so granular about so many things one
of the things I got really granular
about was the way it would feel in your
stomach when you drop that quarter That
Bass wall
[Music]
this is one of those meta moments where
there's a television show based on a
video game and the guy that made the
video game and the guy over here that's
helping adapt the video game both love
video games and we have our whole lives
and giving everybody a chance especially
I think kids who haven't known the mall
arcade experience the way we have to
just enjoy other people enjoying it I
think was great it was beautiful and I
love how Riley knows inherently that
Ellie is going to love the fatality
moves the special finishers for people
who know Mortal Kombat especially when
you played it in 93
the only way you knew about
the cheat codes or fatality codes was
anecdotally you you heard the rumors
because somebody in the yard so glad you
brought that up yeah I'm so glad you're
broadcasting that because I'm sure
people will watch us be like how did
they know the moves how did they figure
out the moves this is actually something
we talked quite quite a lot about and
it's like again as they collect these
totems from this old world one of the
things that used to be really popular
and was still popular in the early 2000s
were video game magazine the magazines
big glossy things like a proper book
you'd flip through and it would discuss
that level yeah I didn't realize I
missed that yeah yeah so if they were
like infatuated with this game Ellie
would collect anything to do with this
game including magazines that would have
listed the moves that they would have
memorized as if they could ever play it
but of course the tragic thing is they
could never play it because those games
don't exist anymore until today yeah
they had this wonderful moment and we we
leave them for a second in inside of the
arcade and the purple light and the
cacophonous sounds
and the cartoonish violence that's
happening inside of that video game we
start to pan out and we follow this root
system and we see that they're not alone
in this mall right that there is an
eminent threat that wakes up yeah and
this is a difference from the game
in the game
there's no indication that there's
anything in the model until much time so
much later and when
it does happen there are a lot of
infected and
as we talked it through we we did like
the idea that I mean you know Ellie's
like that place is full infected and
Riley says well if it's sealed off then
why isn't it sealed off
and then you get in there and you're
like it's not full of infected at all
Riley's correct and Riley's been living
in this mall for a couple of weeks
and she hasn't seen any infected there's
one that's all it takes is just one and
what wakes him up is their Joy
it's the sound of their laughing they're
having fun
as much as we can
we give our characters the things they
want the most and then we punish them
for getting them
and we want them to
be challenged by their darkest fears
and so one of the fears that you have in
this world is that you're never safe
enough to have fun you're never safe
enough to fall in love you're never safe
enough to have a first kiss
there's two threats that are happening
in this moment first is the waking up
the infected that's in there and also
there's a bit of a truth bomb that Riley
drops right
Ellie I'm leaving
me to a post in this
I asked if you could join
so we could go together
but Marlene said no the [Â __Â ] is Marlene
Marlene is the lady that helped me it
doesn't matter
Ellie I tried
yeah yeah Ellie
finds the truth of what Riley's been
doing here it's not just this romantic
oh I've joined the fireflies and have a
gun and all that and Nellie's been
making fun of her for the whole time
well they're pipe bombs and the pipe
bombs have one purpose and that is to be
thrown at fedra in the middle of our
first episode we see what those pipe
bombs can do they blow up a car they
blow up the side of a building they
almost kill tests
and Ellie is confronted with the reality
that this girl that she's so connected
to that she cares so much about is
actively participating in something
meant to kill people like her remember
she was told by Quang in the beginning
you're going to be an officer that means
one day Riley's going to be lobbing one
of these things at her and the whole
fantasy comes crashing in at that point
we have this petulant goodbye
what do you think it is that stops Ellie
and makes her go back
that's love that's what this show is all
about you can't escape the truth of what
you want you can know intellectually
this girl doesn't care about me the way
I care about her
and she is actively participating in
something that could end up in my death
but what if she does care about me that
way and what if I told her would it
matter there's also the fear of like is
this the last interaction I want to have
with her right she's like I think
there's also like there's such a love
that Ellie's will is is now ready to let
her go and later right she says to her
is like I'll support you this is what
you really want I'm your best friend
yeah and I'm not saying it all pissy
yeah I mean it yeah like I think Neil's
right there's this need to just say
goodbye I don't think Ellie goes back
there thinking I'm gonna tell her how I
really feel and I'm gonna kiss her she
goes back there to say a proper goodbye
but she does go back and we get to see
another iconic moment from the Left
Behind game which is the Halloween store
yeah you use Source music again as score
with Etta James version of I Got You
Babe taken right from the game it's
anybody that's played it just knows it I
think a lot of people that play that
game don't realize it's I got you babe
because
Etta's version is so different different
it's funky and fun and it's juxtaposed I
mean that was the challenge of like you
know finding a song that is about
romance but it's not so sentimental that
it's just about romance right and this
just strikes that balance of again the
lyrics are about something but the vibe
you get it's got this like like you're
saying a funky energy that it gets to
hide what it's really about
kind of like very much what is happening
between Ellie and Riley at this moment I
mean literally hiding under masks
and there's this moment as they're
dancing and I love the way Liza shot
this
Riley is a much better dancer than Ellie
that much is clear Ellie's sort of like
doing whatever shuffling or or being a
goof
Riley in that good dancer way is sort of
doing this thing where she's rotating
around and she turns away
from Ellie as she's dancing around and
as she turns away Ellie
slowly stops dancing and here's the
magic of Bella Ramsay
she is wearing a mask that completely
obscures her face and you know exactly
still how she's feeling just from the
way her body moves yes it's magic
it's just there and what she's feeling
there is this connection to Riley that
is so powerful and so joyous that she
just can't let it go she can't walk away
without begging
she just says don't go and
Riley says okay
and then she Ellie kisses her
and and it's just like the game and I
don't think that's a bad thing I think
it's a wonderful thing because it was
perfect in the game and I think it's
perfect here
all of it Bella's reaction after she
kisses her which is like 1500 emotions
in two seconds
and then
you know apologizing and Riley's saying
for what and then Ellie realizing oh my
God and Riley oh we give her like a few
seconds of the greatest joy of her life
just a few seconds yeah but there's like
this thing of the two of them like oh my
God
the time we've wasted being scared when
we both felt this way
and then the world comes crashing in
like you said it's quickly interrupted
by the pivotal moment for Ellie which is
not only
is she bitten
but also Riley is as well and the
disparity again between their responses
I don't know we don't get to see if
Riley has her freakout moment but we
certainly see Ellie's and she smashes
stuff and
Riley responds direct from the game and
almost everything that they say between
each other is lifted from the game there
are a few other little bits here or
there that we put in
but
what I love about this ending more than
anything and credit to HBO for kind of
pushing us to to keep growing it is
what Riley says to Ellie at the end here
is not merely words of comfort or vague
philosophy
it ends this way for everyone sooner or
later right
some of us just
they're faster than
but we don't quit
whether
it's two minutes
two days
we don't give that up
I don't want to give that up
it is a lesson that Ellie has in Her
Bones
and it is why Ellie fights to keep Joel
alive because what Riley is saying is we
don't give up
even if we have two minutes or two days
we just keep going because we love each
other and death comes for us all the
time we have is the time we have the
fact that it must end is not a reason
for us to not love
and there's Ellie who's been told to go
away who knows Joel's gonna die there's
no [Â __Â ] way she's gonna be able to
save him she's not gonna quit and she
ransacks this house looking for what
thread to stitch him up it's the only
thing she knows how to do with a wound
because of her own life and she goes
back down there
and oh my God they hold their the hands
being held it's like
it's so beautiful to me and and then
when she's sewing him up the look on her
face is just
what do you describe it it's it's a
desperation yeah and and and fury it's
almost like I won't [Â __Â ] let you go I
will will it yes I will be impossible
yes will it work
that is something we'll have to find out
next week

ChatGPT:


Below is an updated comprehensive overview of Craig Mazin’s speaking style, now factoring in the fourth transcript (Episode 7 of The Last of Us companion podcast). As before, we’ll look at Tone, Vernacular, Depth/Substance, Diction/Delivery, Personal/Collaborative Approach, and Crassness—including how he handles mentions of intimacy or sexuality. Examples from all four transcripts appear in each section.

1. Overall Tone

Conversational and Warm

Transcript 1 (Scriptnotes, solo monologue): Teaches writing with a personal, almost fireside-chat feel, e.g. “Calm down, you don’t need to look it up.”

Transcript 3 (HBO Pod Ep. 5): Even when discussing brutal story elements (Henry’s tragic end), he’s accessible: “He’s done the very thing he never wanted to do, and there’s nothing left.”

Transcript 4 (HBO Pod Ep. 7): Continues that intimate tone, especially around teenage emotions: “I wanted to be that kid [Ellie], she’s so brave.”

Mentor-Like & Analytical

Transcript 2 (HBO Pod Ep. 6): Deep dives into Joel’s psychological state and fatherhood parallels.

Transcript 4: Dissects the decision to incorporate the DLC’s storyline, explaining why Riley’s story matters—“We want to see Ellie’s first taste of real love, and how that propels her to save Joel.”

Emotionally Grounded

Transcript 4: Speaks candidly about Ellie and Riley’s budding romance: “I remember that feeling of being physically close to a girl I liked… there’s just something there.”

Transcript 1: Advises writers to anchor structure in emotional truths, e.g. “Structure is a symptom of a character’s relationship with a central dramatic argument.”

2. Vernacular / Word Choice

Casual + Technical Blending

Transcript 1: Phrases like “It’s mind blowing,” “Go torture your heroes” intermixed with references to Aristotle’s Poetics and theme vs. anti-theme.

Transcript 4: Talks about “Left Behind” DLC mechanics (“agency for the player”) while also dropping real-life teenage anecdotes—“I grew up skipping school… I wanted to hang out with my friends.”

Frequent Asides & Questions

Transcript 3: “Should Henry kill himself or not? We had a long, long conversation.”

Transcript 4: “How did they know the fatality moves? We had to figure that out,” addressing a gamer’s question about Mortal Kombat 2.

Banter and Humor

Transcript 2: Exchanges playful barbs with co-showrunner Neil Druckmann (“He basically said, ‘You fuck, I wish I’d thought of that!’”).

Transcript 4: Jokes about teenage rebellion—“I [Â __Â ] hated hearing about ‘potential,’” referencing his own high school experience.

3. Depth and Substance

Story Philosophy & Thematic Focus

Transcript 2: Zeroes in on Joel’s fear and how it shapes the entire narrative: “He’s terrified he can’t protect her.”

Transcript 4: Highlights how Left Behind deepens Ellie’s character: “It’s a lesson in love that she carries forward when she fights to save Joel.”

Adaptation Insights

Transcript 3: Explains why the show deviates from the game in Kansas City.

Transcript 4: Details how they merged the Left Behind DLC with existing TV arcs—“HBO suggested tying back to Joel’s storyline, so we wove Ellie’s flashback in more tightly.”

Empathy & Human Vulnerability

Transcript 1: “Fear is the heart of empathy,” wanting the audience to feel what characters feel.

Transcript 4: Showcases teenage insecurity: “She’s looking at herself in the reflection at Victoria’s Secret, unsure she’s attractive. That’s the fear of rejection.”

4. Diction and Delivery

Direct Imperatives

Transcript 1: “Write your world to oppose your character’s desires,” “Push them forward.”

Transcript 4: He’s less instructive but still certain: “We absolutely needed the photo booth scene. Period.”

Emphatic Repetition & Metaphors

Transcript 3: “He’s done, he’s just done,” driving home Henry’s final despair.

Transcript 4: Compares teenage crushes to “that first heartbeat” and emphasizes how “the world stops in 2003,” shaping attitudes toward same-sex relationships.

Unfiltered, Candid Speech

Transcript 2: “He basically said, ‘Go fuck yourself.’”

Transcript 3: “I shit you not,” describing Lamar Johnson learning sign language in a weekend.

Transcript 4: Uses mild expletives when describing Ellie's rebelliousness—“She’s so [Â __Â ] cool.”

5. Personal and Collaborative Approach

Credits Others Frequently

Transcript 3: Praises production designers, VFX teams, actors like Kevon Woodard (Sam).

Transcript 4: Highlights Liza Johnson’s direction, Storm Reid’s portrayal of Riley, and co-writer Neil Druckmann’s original DLC work—“All of it ties back to the story Neil created.”

Personal Anecdotes

Transcript 1: Likens writing to “making babies” vs. coroner’s “taking bodies apart,” personalizing structural theory.

Transcript 4: Recalls his own teenage experiences of “sneaking into my parents’ liquor cabinet, taking a swig of amaretto,” connecting it to Ellie’s first taste of moonshine.

Emotional Investment

Transcript 2: Compares Joel’s paternal fears to his own fatherhood.

Transcript 4: “We give our characters the things they want most, then punish them for it,” reflecting an empathetic, but ruthless, writerly approach.

6. Crassness (and How He Handles Sexual/Intimate Content)

Occasional Profanity for Emphasis

Transcript 1: Encourages “twisting the knife,” “punching them in the face,” with a few expletives sprinkled, though less explicitly profane.

Transcript 4: Ellie's defiance is described with “She’s so [Â __Â ] cool,” or “Don’t talk [Â __Â ] about my friend.” He uses cursing casually but not gratuitously, showing excitement or strong emotion.

Matter-of-Fact Tone on Sexual/Intimate Moments

Transcript 2: If sex or attraction is referenced (e.g., comedic tangents), he’s plainspoken, never coy. He keeps the focus on emotional truth rather than graphic detail.

Transcript 4: Talks about Ellie and Riley’s first kiss—Victoria’s Secret, teenage lust, and fear of rejection. He describes it with a calm, straightforward pragmatism: “They’re wearing these masks, dancing to Etta James; it’s a reflection of their insecurities, their closeted feelings.” There’s no sensationalism.

Mentions “lingerie designed to be incredibly feminine to attract men,” but frames it as a realistic teenage concern—he’s blunt, slightly wry (“they don’t get the allure”), but not explicit.

Unapologetic Yet Respectful

Even when referencing teen romance or sexuality, Craig’s language is comfortable and direct. He references “masking their feelings” or “subconscious closeness” without moralizing, focusing on psychological stakes.

Profanity remains in a similar comedic or emphasis-laden vein: “I [Â __Â ] hate that phrase, ‘Is the juice worth the squeeze?’ Absolutely it is.”

Summary

Factoring in the fourth transcript, Craig Mazin remains:

Conversational and warm, able to discuss teenage intimacy and heartbreak with the same directness he brings to analyzing story beats or production challenges.

Analytical, weaving in behind-the-scenes production logic (e.g., building a two-story mall set with CGI, licensing Mortal Kombat 2) alongside anecdotal glimpses of his own youth.

Emotionally transparent, whether describing Ellie’s heartbreak or Joel’s paternal dread.

Occasionally crass but always purposeful, dropping “fuck,” “[Â __Â ],” or “holy shit” to underscore frustration, humor, or excitement—never for shock value alone.

Pragmatic about sexual references, framing them as a natural extension of character arcs (teen experimentation, first kisses, hidden crushes) rather than an explicit or salacious focal point.

In all four transcripts, his style remains a balance of heartfelt guidance, frank enthusiasm, and collaborative respect for co-creators, cast, and the audience’s intelligence.

User:


Can you clarify for me: what is "[Â __Â ]"?
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


In the transcripts you provided, [Â __Â ] typically appears where the transcription software or original text replaced censored or indistinct dialogue. In other words, it’s a placeholder for a bleeped-out expletive (like “shit,” “fuck,” “ass,” etc.) or for a moment where the audio wasn’t clear enough to capture the exact word. Essentially, [Â __Â ] just stands in for the missing text—usually an obscenity—rather than displaying the word itself.
--------------------------------------
User:


Can you infer what belongs in the areas of your notes that contain "[Â __Â ]" and fill in your inferred replacement? I don't want a gratuitous account of swearing, but the meaning behind these items are important to understand how Craig Mazin presents the information.

Below is a clarified version of the same comprehensive style overview, replacing the [Â __ ] placeholders with inferred expletives or strong language that, from context, Craig Mazin and/or the speakers appear to have used.

Where context suggests which specific swear word is intended, I’ve filled it in accordingly.

Transcript 4: “We give them what they want—love—then punish them,” highlighting the heartbreak that ends Riley’s and Ellie’s perfect night.

6. Crassness (Replacing [Â __ ] With Likely Expletives)

Occasional Profanity for Emphasis

Transcript 1: Less frequent, but uses strong figurative language: “punch them right in the face,” “twist the knife.”

Transcript 2: Relates a direct quote from Neil: “He basically said, ‘You fuck, I wish I’d thought of that.’”

Transcript 3: “I shit you not,” marveling at an anecdote. “Oh fuck, we have to shoot nights for three weeks.”

Transcript 4: Explains teenage Ellie’s rebellion: “She doesn’t give a shit about authority… She’s so proud she fucked Bethany up.”

When Captain Kwong outlines Ellie’s two paths, he references “shit food,” “shit jobs,” and “shit orders,” clarifying how bleak it is if she fails to shape up.

Ellie also retorts, “What the fuck is Marlene?” upon hearing the name for the first time, showing her typical bluntness.

Matter-of-Fact Tone on Sexual/Intimate Moments

Transcript 2: If referencing comedic or romantic moments, he’s straightforward—“He basically said, ‘Go fuck yourself’… it was a term of endearment.”

Transcript 4: Describes Ellie and Riley’s first kiss with forthright emotion: “They’re dancing in Halloween masks, and it’s scary because they’re both gay in 2003.”

Speaks calmly about teenage attraction, never sensationalizing the sexual aspect—just focusing on the emotional vulnerability.

Unapologetic Yet Respectful

Uses curses to illustrate frustration, highlight comedic banter, or convey strong feelings, not to shock the audience.

Sexual references (like lingerie in the Victoria’s Secret scene) are handled with a pragmatic, character-driven lens—“They don’t get the allure, and that’s deeply tied to their own insecurities.”

Inferred Replacements for [Â __ ]

To summarize how these placeholders appear in context, below are some direct examples:

“You do [Â __ ] jobs, you eat [Â __ ] food, you take [Â __ ] orders…”
Likely becomes: “You do shit jobs, you eat shit food, you take shit orders…”

“She’s so proud that she [Â __ ] Bethany up.”
Context strongly suggests: “She’s so proud that she fucked Bethany up.”

“I told you I’d [Â __ ] do it.”
Probably: “I told you I’d fucking do it.”

“The [Â __ ] is Marlene?”
Almost certainly: “The fuck is Marlene?”

Throughout all four transcripts, these inserted expletives match the casual, emphatic way Craig (or the characters he’s quoting) speak—blunt, but purposeful in underscoring frustration, excitement, or comedic effect.

Final Characterization

With the expletives clarified, Craig Mazin’s style remains a blend of:

Friendly mentorship (teaching structural or emotional points),

Analytical depth (explaining motivation or adaptation logic),

Open emotionality (fatherhood parallels, heartbreak in narrative), and

Occasional, emphatic profanity (not gratuitous, but deliberate to hit certain beats).

He’s as comfortable explaining how a teenage crush can spark panic as he is discussing set construction or script structure. Ultimately, the inferred cursing merely reinforces his natural, unfiltered persona—a collaborator who values honesty, empathy, and a bit of irreverent humor in service of good storytelling.

Good. Now use the following assignment with Craig Mazin as the speaker you are analyzing:

Your Task: Use the principles of semantics to uncover the reasons behind someone’s speech or writing style. Follow these steps and address each point carefully:

1. Core Concepts in Semantics
   - Meaning: Identify what each word or symbol represents in context.
   - Sense vs. Reference:
     - Sense: Determine the mental or conceptual ideas behind the words.
     - Reference: Pinpoint the specific real-world entities or situations those words refer to.
   - Compositionality: Look at how individual words or phrases combine to shape the overall message.
   - Truth Conditions: Assess if the statements can be proven true or false based on facts or context.

2. Branches of Semantics
   - Lexical Semantics: Examine word choices and how certain synonyms or terms might reveal intent.
   - Phrasal Semantics: Analyze how phrases and idiomatic expressions shape the speaker’s message.
   - Formal Semantics: Consider logical or mathematical structures that govern the communication.
   - Cognitive Semantics: Explore how personal experiences and mental models influence language use.
   - Cultural Semantics: Observe cultural or community-based factors that affect meaning.

3. Theories of Meaning
   - Referential Theory: Identify direct references to actual objects or events.
   - Ideational Theory: Look for internal ideas or beliefs shaping the speaker’s word choices.
   - Causal Theory: Determine how situational context or expected reactions guide the speaker.
   - Truth-Conditional Theory: Decide if the speaker’s statements hinge on being true or false.

4. Related Fields
   - Syntax: Check sentence structure and how it influences clarity or impact.
   - Pragmatics: Account for tone, context, and implied meanings.
   - Etymology: Investigate historical shifts in word usage that might affect interpretation.
   - Hermeneutics: Interpret complex or layered texts by considering background knowledge and context.

5. Knowledge Representation
   - Semantic Networks: Visualize or outline connections among words, ideas, and concepts to see deeper relationships.

6. Applications
   - Language Understanding: Use these insights to interpret someone’s intentions or underlying motives.
   - Education: Employ semantic principles to clarify teaching methods and ensure accurate understanding of concepts.

Key Relationships
- Combine semantics with syntax and pragmatics to see the full picture of why a person uses language in a specific way.
- Compare different meaning theories to figure out whether the speaker aims to establish facts, evoke mental images, provoke action, or claim universal truths.
- Incorporate cultural and personal experiences (cognitive semantics) to appreciate the speaker’s unique perspective.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Below is a semantic analysis of Craig Mazin’s speaking style, applying each of the specified steps. The focus is on how his words and phrases convey meaning, why he uses them, and the contextual factors that shape his communication.

1. Core Concepts in Semantics
A. Meaning

Craig’s language often represents a balance between screenwriting theory (structural or thematic concepts) and personal anecdote (fatherhood experiences, behind-the-scenes anecdotes). Words like “structure,” “theme,” or “empathy” symbolize specific craft principles—he uses them to anchor the listener’s understanding of how stories work. Meanwhile, more colloquial terms (“shit,” “punch,” “go torture your heroes”) represent his unfiltered emphasis on the emotional or visceral side of writing and storytelling.

B. Sense vs. Reference

Sense: When he says “push your characters” or “torture your heroes,” the conceptual idea is forcing conflict in stories—not literal torture. The sense lies in the metaphorical push to intensify drama.

Reference: When referencing “Joel” or “Ellie,” he points to actual characters in The Last of Us, real entities within that fictional universe. When he cites “Pixar” or “Aristotle,” those are real-world references—actual companies or philosophers.

C. Compositionality

Craig combines personal experiences (e.g., fatherhood, skipping school) with technical screenwriting advice (inciting incidents, structure). Each word or phrase—whether an F-bomb or an academic term—builds a layered message: teaching craft while staying genuine and accessible.

D. Truth Conditions

Most of his statements about screenwriting (e.g., “Structure is a symptom of character evolution”) aren’t purely factual or false; they’re guiding principles. They’re not strictly “true” or “false” in a binary sense but are opinions or theories rooted in personal expertise. By contrast, some references to production facts—like “We built an entire cul-de-sac set”—can be verified or falsified, fulfilling typical truth conditions of factual claims.

2. Branches of Semantics
A. Lexical Semantics

Craig’s word choices reveal intent:

Terms like “empathy,” “fear,” “theme” convey emotional or conceptual weight.

Expletives (“fuck,” “shit”) amplify intensity or emphasis, rather than simply insulting.

B. Phrasal Semantics

He often uses idiomatic expressions—“twist the knife,” “push them forward”—that shape the audience’s perception of creative conflict. Phrases like “You’re the Old Testament God” evoke specific imagery (wrath, severity) that underscores how far writers should go to challenge their characters.

C. Formal Semantics

In direct screenwriting instructions (e.g., “Structure arises from a central argument”), he sometimes uses quasi-logical statements—“If A, then B”—to illustrate story mechanics. This formal structure helps listeners see the cause-effect relationship in narrative decisions.

D. Cognitive Semantics

His personal experiences (fatherhood anecdotes, teenage memories) reveal mental models shaping how he interprets storytelling. He draws parallels between real emotions (fear of losing a child) and fictional ones (Joel’s terror), thus mapping real-world cognition onto story arcs.

E. Cultural Semantics

By referencing pop culture (e.g., Mortal Kombat II, game mechanics, post-2003 world) and modern screenwriting norms, Craig’s language is steeped in entertainment-industry culture. He also acknowledges shifts in social acceptance (e.g., teenage sexuality, LGBTQ representation)—cultural contexts that color his commentary on relationships or father-daughter parallels.

3. Theories of Meaning
A. Referential Theory

When he directly points to real events—like an actual set being built for The Last of Us—he uses language with a clear real-world reference. “We built a neighborhood” or “We licensed Mortal Kombat II” ties the words to concrete facts and production experiences.

B. Ideational Theory

He conveys his own ideas/beliefs about screenwriting: “Fear is the heart of empathy” or “Be cruel to your characters.” These statements reflect internal convictions about what writing should accomplish.

C. Causal Theory

His consistent mention of fatherhood or behind-the-scenes details suggests a desire to trigger emotional or intellectual responses in listeners. The situational context—talking with co-showrunner Neil Druckmann, or explaining how a game adaptation works—guides why he chooses certain words (“fear,” “panic,” “pain”) to elicit empathy or reflection.

D. Truth-Conditional Theory

Many of his statements about craft are subjective or instructive. They’re not strictly tested for truth or falsity; rather, they function as guidelines. However, if he cites production facts (dates, budgets, event details), those become truth-conditional references that could be verified.

4. Related Fields
A. Syntax

He tends to deliver sentences in a straightforward, sometimes imperative form: “Push them forward,” “Go torture your heroes.” The direct syntax enforces his teacherly stance: a short command urging action.

B. Pragmatics

Contextual cues—like when he jokes “Go fuck yourself” is just playful banter—show how tone or situation alters meaning. These phrases might seem harsh literally, but in context, they’re part of an informal, supportive exchange.

C. Etymology

He seldom explores a word’s historical development, though his references to older terms (“inciting incident,” “Hegelian dialectic,” “archetype”) rely on broad knowledge. The modern usage suits contemporary screenwriting talk, so any deeper historical shift is not typically foregrounded.

D. Hermeneutics

He occasionally interprets layered texts—like delving into a scene’s hidden emotional underpinnings or referencing how an arcade scene from Left Behind “mirrors a bigger emotional truth.” He unpacks script text or game content with the background knowledge of a seasoned writer.

5. Knowledge Representation
Semantic Networks

We can imagine connecting key words (e.g., “fear,” “empathy,” “structure,” “fatherhood”) to see how they interrelate in Craig’s discourse. He frequently links paternal themes to story arcs, lumps “fear” and “empathy” under character motivations, and ties “structure” to writerly tasks. This cluster of concepts forms a concept map that clarifies his approach: emotional impetus => structural tension => audience engagement.

6. Applications
A. Language Understanding

By analyzing his semantics, we see that Craig aims to motivate and guide. His specific references to fatherhood or set-building aren’t random—they’re chosen to resonate with creators or fans on a personal level.

B. Education

His teaching style—loaded with direct instructions and personal analogies—demonstrates how semantic clarity fosters effective learning. He clarifies key writing theories by merging practical references and conceptual frames, ensuring comprehension.

Key Relationships

Craig’s pragmatic style, casual syntax, and occasional expletives all shape meaning.

He compares or synthesizes cultural references (e.g., Mortal Kombat II) with personal or universal truths, aligning them under a cognitive and emotional semantics approach.

Truth-Conditional logic applies mostly to factual production details, while instructions about “fear” or “empathy” rely on subjective or ideational meaning.

Summary of Semantic Approach

Craig Mazin’s speech reveals:

A blend of referential details (actual production stories) and ideational stances (beliefs about storytelling).

Context-driven swearing and analogies serving a causal purpose: to elicit emotional/intellectual response.

Semantically, he balances craft-laden syntax, colloquial emphasis, and thematic conceptualization, reinforcing a pragmatic teacherly style aimed at inspiring empathy and narrative depth.

1. Core Concepts in Semantics

A. Meaning  
Craig’s language often represents a balance between screenwriting theory (structural or thematic concepts) and personal anecdote (fatherhood experiences, behind-the-scenes anecdotes). Words like “structure,” “theme,” or “empathy” symbolize specific craft principles—used to anchor the listener’s understanding of story mechanics. Colloquial terms (“shit,” “punch,” “go torture your heroes”) emphasize the emotional or visceral side of storytelling.

B. Sense vs. Reference  
- Sense: Phrases like “push your characters” or “torture your heroes” convey metaphorical meaning—the conceptual urge to intensify narrative stakes.  
- Reference: Names like “Joel,” “Ellie,” “Pixar,” or “Aristotle” refer directly to known fictional characters or real-world entities relevant to Mazin’s commentary.

C. Compositionality  
Mazin combines emotional truths (fear, love, regret) with narrative principles to form integrated guidance. Statements like “structure is a symptom of character evolution” combine abstract theory with concrete storytelling.

D. Truth Conditions  
Craft-related statements (“You must push your characters”) are subjective, not strictly verifiable, but production claims (“We built a neighborhood”) are grounded in facts and can be confirmed or denied.

2. Branches of Semantics

A. Lexical Semantics  
Word choices balance academic and colloquial registers. “Empathy,” “argument,” and “structure” reflect technical intent. “Fuck,” “shit,” and “punch” inject urgency or directness, not vulgarity for its own sake.

B. Phrasal Semantics  
Idiom and metaphor are central. Expressions like “twist the knife” or “Christ-like” enhance psychological and moral stakes. They reinforce his directive tone and dark thematic focus.

C. Formal Semantics  
He uses quasi-formal structures when discussing narrative logic: “If you lie to your kid to protect them, eventually you must tell the truth to keep them safe.” These maintain logical relationships while keeping things personal.

D. Cognitive Semantics  
His reflections on parenting, teenage anxiety, and trauma indicate deep emotional mapping between real life and fiction. Experiences become symbolic tools that clarify character arcs and thematic exploration.

E. Cultural Semantics  
References to mall culture, arcade games, early 2000s attitudes toward sexuality, and military or societal collapse reflect the post-pandemic American lens of his storytelling. Mazin’s language assumes familiarity with this context and leverages it to reinforce social commentary.

3. Theories of Meaning

A. Referential Theory  
References to real production tasks (“building sets,” “licensing Mortal Kombat II”) ground statements in observable reality.

B. Ideational Theory  
Beliefs guide his commentary. Concepts like “fear is the root of empathy” reflect internal mental models that dictate his preferred storytelling method.

C. Causal Theory  
Situational dynamics (podcast setting, character focus, parenthood themes) shape his language. He adjusts tone and phrasing to influence listener emotion, not just convey knowledge.

D. Truth-Conditional Theory  
Most statements about story craft or emotion resist binary truth value. Technical details (release dates, production facts) meet truth-conditional standards; interpretive ones do not.

4. Related Fields

A. Syntax  
He favors imperative and declarative sentence structures: short, directive, instructive. These enhance authority and clarity—e.g., “Push them,” “Don’t let go,” “Torture your heroes.”

B. Pragmatics  
Context dictates how swear words or sarcasm function. “Go fuck yourself” is used endearingly when directed at Neil Druckmann. Repetition of phrases (“don’t go,” “stay awake”) is charged with subtext.

C. Etymology  
While not explicitly etymological, he draws on words loaded with narrative or genre weight (“bloater,” “clicker,” “NPC”) that carry meaning specific to gaming and adaptation audiences.

D. Hermeneutics  
He performs layered interpretation—e.g., dissecting subtext behind Ellie’s mask-wearing during a dance or Kathleen’s pursuit of vengeance. These analyses require layered reading of performance, design, and script.

5. Knowledge Representation

Semantic Networks  
- “Fear,” “parent,” “empathy,” “death,” and “protection” cluster into a parental-emotional framework.  
- “Structure,” “argument,” “stakes,” and “escalation” form a narrative-function framework.  
- “Adaptation,” “game,” “cutscene,” “perspective” create a media-transposition framework.

These form cross-linked models of character-driven narrative logic built on emotional resonance and moral complexity.

Using each section's insights thoroughly, please rework the information into a guide on how anyone could write like Craig "speaks" (the material was taken from a combination of his speaking and writing, but we're applying it to writing). Where labels are needed, minimalistic. Use your tokens primarily on conveying with clarity and practicality to provide the reader with the clearest path to writing like Craig.
--------------------------------------
ChatGPT:


Write with a balance of sincerity and rigor. Start by defining exactly what each key concept in your piece represents, then clarify who or what you’re pointing to. If you’re discussing, say, “fear,” treat it not just as an abstract idea but as something personal—rooted in a memory, anecdote, or experience. Pair any technical point with a corresponding human angle.

Show how each statement fits into a broader structure. Don’t just list facts; integrate them so each sentence flows into a greater argument or message. Accept that many big ideas (like “structure is a symptom of character evolution”) aren’t verifiable like a simple yes/no claim, so write them like philosophies: your view on how stories work, rooted in the logic of human experience.

Choose words that convey the emotional weight behind your topic. Mix everyday phrases with the occasional technical term to maintain a voice that’s both relaxed and informed. If you need to push the intensity or hammer home a crucial point, deploy a blunt expression—something like “This is the stuff that matters” or a stronger expletive—but only when it carries real meaning, not just shock value.

Tie your language to tangible references—concrete examples, a specific scene, or a known figure—but keep a conceptual background too. If you mention a memorable character, let that reference serve a dual purpose: illustrate the idea, then highlight the principle at work. This duality—shifting between big-picture theory and real-world evidence—keeps your writing grounded and your arguments relatable.

When discussing logic or structure, phrase your points as short directives. Give concise instructions, almost like commands: “Show your protagonist’s biggest fear,” “Expose the emotional break,” “Push the conflict one step further.” These imperative statements channel that instructive, mentor-like tone.

Make space for your own life. Sprinkle in small glimpses of personal experience—a childhood mishap, a favorite piece of media, a minor fiasco—whatever leads the reader to feel your words as genuine. If you need your text to reflect heartbreak, link it to the time you felt true loss or panic. If your point is perseverance, reference a defining moment. Maintain that closeness between idea and personal grounding.

Finally, allow for frankness. If you’re discussing raw emotions—terror, heartbreak, fury—don’t dilute them. Let a well-placed “fuck” or “shit” emphasize the depth of the moment. But keep it purposeful: too many sapped of meaning can distract from your core insights. In the end, your goal is to teach, to reveal, to share. So be warm, be direct, and weave your real moments together with your bigger theories. That’s how you create a voice that mirrors Craig’s presence—both down-to-earth and fiercely analytical.

1. Overall Tone
• Conversational, Warm Delivery
Use words that symbolically stand for both complex ideas (e.g., “theme,” “empathy”) and relatable emotions (e.g., “fear,” “love”). In terms of sense vs. reference, the sense is your conceptual warmth toward the reader, while references might include actual scenarios or personal moments that invite a welcoming vibe. Compositionality means each phrase—technical or colloquial—shapes the bigger picture of an open, inclusive attitude. Truth conditions rarely apply in a strict sense here since it’s mostly guidance, not verifiable data.
• Mentor-Like and Analytical
Construct statements logically (formal semantics), offering direct imperatives (“Push your characters,” “Reinforce their fears”). Keep them anchored in real-world references: if you mention an example, make it concrete (like a scene from your own story). This duality of instructing plus illustrating clarifies the meaning behind the instructions.
• Emotionally Grounded
Tie thematic talk to characters’ internal states, referencing cultural or personal experiences (cognitive semantics). If you discuss a dramatic plot turn, highlight its emotional rationale. When you hint at sadness or triumph, you’re using sense-level concepts (raw feelings) while referencing specific narrative points for resonance.
Characterization Summary
Craig Mazin’s tone merges an approachable teacherly style with a consistent emotional depth, ensuring even technical insights remain human-centric.

2. Vernacular / Word Choice
• Casual + Technical
Balance everyday words with industry or academic terms. Lexical semantics here involves choosing synonyms (“pain,” “tragedy,” “arc”) that best convey your inner concept of narrative strain. The reference side might be real film examples, while the sense side is the abstract tension you want your reader to grasp.
• Frequent Asides & Questions
Phrasal semantics come into play: rhetorical questions like “Why push them so hard?” serve to engage. These short digressions or asides build compositional clarity: they keep the reader involved while spotlighting your creative reasoning.
• Occasional Humor
Playful phrases or mild sarcasm can lighten dense topics. Culturally speaking, humorous references (“an old arcade,” “the worst high school memories”) let the audience connect shared experiences to your deeper narrative lessons without trivializing the material.
Characterization Summary
His blend of casual speech, theoretical terms, and brief, witty interludes invites readers into a comfortable yet informed space.

3. Depth and Substance
• Story Philosophy
Discuss sense-level ideas—like “fear is the engine of empathy”—and apply them as guiding truths. Even if they’re not fact-checkable, they shape understanding (truth-conditional theory becomes secondary; the focus is on ideational content). Show how these beliefs reference both personal experience and broader narrative tradition.
• Adaptation Insights
Reference actual shifts you might make when adapting someone else’s work, grounding them in real creative or production contexts (referential theory). Combine that with formal semantics—if you alter a key story beat, logically explain how it maintains thematic sense.
• Empathy & Vulnerability
Use emotional language to highlight characters’ fragility. Cognitive semantics: show how personal struggles (like a parent’s terror) map onto fictional arcs. This approach reveals moral complexity, elevating each plot point beyond surface action.
Characterization Summary
He consistently moves past the literal event, focusing on deeper emotional and thematic motives that empower each narrative decision.

4. Diction and Delivery
• Direct Imperatives
Syntax here favors short, instructive lines. “Drive them harder,” “Show their weakness.” Such crisp commands simplify your meaning. Pragmatically, they make you sound decisive, matching a mentor’s clarity.
• Emphatic Repetition & Metaphors
Use repeated phrases or symbols to unite ideas. Metaphors (e.g., “You’re an old-testament god”) highlight emotional stakes. Phrasal semantics ensures each metaphor’s sense resonates: they’re not random but tied to the larger story logic.
• Candid Tone
Avoid hedging. Focus on sincerity and straightforwardness. If you say “You must kill your darlings,” treat it as urgent counsel, not a vague suggestion. The causal theory implies you’re prompting an emotional or behavioral response in the reader—follow your truth.
Characterization Summary
Craig’s style is bold and transparent, relying on concise orders, recurring motifs, and unwavering directness to sustain momentum.

5. Personal / Collaborative Approach
• Frequent Acknowledgments
Refer to others’ input and achievements, reinforcing community. Let real names or instances illustrate the sense of shared labor. This fosters trust by referencing specific real-world collaborations.
• Personal Anecdotes
Tie your creative advice to anecdotes about your own childhood, work setbacks, or comedic mishaps. Cognitive semantics shows how these personal frames help readers mentally map big ideas onto their own experiences. Use just enough detail to illuminate, not overshadow.
• Emotional Investment
Maintain an undercurrent of care for each story element. If you mention a tough production day, highlight not just facts but how it felt. This sense-based approach deepens the narrative’s impact, revealing the passion behind every choice.
Characterization Summary
He treats the creative journey as a cooperative effort, with personal stories and gratitude woven into the instruction, fostering a sense of shared growth.

6. Crassness (Ever-Present, Nuanced)
• Purposeful Profanity
Words like “fuck” or “shit” underscore frustration, surprise, or strong conviction. Through lexical semantics, these expletives act as intensifiers. Use them sparingly to add punch; overdoing it weakens the effect.
• Matter-of-Fact About Intimacy
If you write about romance, sexual identity, or personal attraction, do so in a forthright way. Sense vs. reference: the sense addresses raw emotion; the reference acknowledges tangible situations that spark such feelings. Avoid sensationalizing; root it in authentic character experiences.
• Underlying Consistency
Persist in this straightforward style so it remains part of your “voice” rather than a one-off trick. Compositional cohesion means each blunt expression fits the context, maintaining trust with the reader.
Characterization Summary
Craig’s frank approach to strong language and intimacy is consistent, using blunt words deliberately to emphasize emotional or narrative significance.

Reference relevant details (e.g., certain scenes, plot beats) to illustrate where and why you diverge from the original blueprint.

Empathy & Vulnerability

Purposeful Profanity

Deploy words like “fuck,” “shit,” or “damn” sparingly and intentionally—lending weight to crucial turning points or personal frustrations.

Make sure the intensity of the language aligns with a moment’s emotional gravity, not just for shock or filler.

Matter-of-Fact About Intimacy

When broaching romance, attraction, or sexuality, approach it with directness rather than coyness.

Portray the characters’ emotional truths—uncertainty, desire, shame, euphoria—rather than glossing over or sensationalizing.

Underlying Consistency

Maintain this frank style throughout. Let it remain a core feature of your “voice,” so readers understand you’re genuine, not trying to appear edgy.

Overall Effect
A direct, unfiltered writing voice that punctuates moments of humor or heartfelt revelation with well-placed strong language, emphasizing honesty and depth rather than casual irreverence.

Copy code
1. Overall Tone
• Conversational, Warm Delivery: Approach serious or complex topics with an easygoing style that immediately places readers at ease. Center each explanation on relatable examples—perhaps a common dilemma or a personal anecdote—to create an inclusive atmosphere. When introducing new concepts, spare your audience an overload of jargon; instead, gently fold in definitions and clarifications. Keep the flow personal enough that readers feel you are speaking directly to them.
• Mentor-Like and Analytical: Present observations as helpful lessons, carefully explaining the logic behind each. Offer both practical steps and the rationale that underpins them. If you advise a structural adjustment in a draft, show why it matters rather than simply issuing commands. This combination of rational breakdown and guiding support conveys intellectual rigor without losing a collaborative vibe.
• Emotionally Grounded: Continually ground abstract themes in emotional realities. If you propose a narrative device, demonstrate how it resonates with deeper human feelings—fear, hope, or moral conflict. In every segment, tie theory back to the heart of why stories resonate: shared emotions and experiences that transcend the page or screen.
Characterization Summary: A style that blends a gentle, human-centered approach with clear, reasoned insights, ensuring even dense topics stay profoundly relatable.

2. Vernacular / Word Choice
• Casual + Technical: Weave everyday phrases into discussions that also mention academic or specialized terms. For instance, begin by saying “Let’s talk about how you can crank up the tension,” then support it with a note on “the internal, interpersonal, and external axes of conflict.” This toggling between relaxed language and precise terminology maintains both accessibility and credibility.
• Frequent Asides & Questions: Periodically pause to invite the reader to think further. Ask “What would this scene gain if we added a moment of genuine fear?” or “Is it time to challenge the hero’s moral compass?” These short, direct queries keep them active in the dialogue, rather than passively absorbing data. Use side comments or personal observations as micro-breaks in the flow—moments that re-engage their attention.
• Occasional Humor: Pepper in mild jokes, cultural references, or playful bits of self-deprecation to offset heavier instruction. For instance, comment that “our last scene was as pleasant as a broken radiator in winter,” or poke fun at your own initial confusion when first reading a script. This ensures an otherwise serious discussion remains approachable, even for readers new to the topic.
Characterization Summary: A linguistic style that oscillates between relaxed, friendly speech and knowledge-based vocabulary, bridged by quick, engaging asides or humor.

3. Depth and Substance
• Story Philosophy: Reveal how every structural choice stems from your overarching philosophy of storytelling: that characters’ deeper motivations drive narrative shape. Insist that if tension, conflict, or heartbreak occurs, it should emerge from real emotional underpinnings, never arbitrary coincidence. Show how all threads circle back to your central conviction about what makes a story memorable and moving.
• Adaptation Insights: Emphasize how transferring ideas from one form (a play, a game, a novel) to another should enhance emotional resonance. If something changes, connect that change to a purposeful motive—for instance, adding or removing a character to highlight your central theme. Reference actual or hypothetical examples that demonstrate how these revisions align with your story philosophy and reinforce empathy.
• Empathy & Vulnerability: Underscore that genuine vulnerability—either from protagonists or supporting characters—is the axis on which audience investment spins. Portray internal battles, show moral quandaries, and highlight the universal struggles behind them. When you teach or advise, link these vulnerabilities to a broader tapestry of fears, desires, and moral tensions that define the human condition.
Characterization Summary: A habit of pushing deeper than plot mechanics, consistently turning narrative choices into reflections of heartfelt or thematic undercurrents.

4. Diction and Delivery
• Direct Imperatives: When you pinpoint an action writers should take, phrase it as a crisp directive (“Make them face their worst regret,” “Isolate your hero at the moment of crisis”). This succinct approach conveys clarity and urgency. It also enhances your authoritative posture as a guiding mentor.
• Emphatic Repetition & Metaphors: Select key terms or tropes that echo throughout your text. If your focus is “empathy,” bring that word up at strategic intervals, ensuring it becomes a thematic anchor. Enrich the discussion using metaphors that speak to the underlying conflicts—words like “pulling back a slingshot” or “lighting the fuse” can evoke tension or escalation. Reinforce them so the reader remembers the core emotional beats you want to convey.
• Candid Tone: Keep disclaimers minimal. If you have an opinion or recommendation, state it plainly: “Cut that subplot if it doesn’t fuel the emotional payoff.” This directness signals conviction. When you include a comedic or personal note, maintain the same forthright manner to unify the overall style and preserve trust with your reader.
Characterization Summary: A straightforward, energetic approach that combines crisp instructions, recurring symbolic language, and a no-nonsense honesty.

5. Personal / Collaborative Approach
• Frequent Acknowledgments: Name-check collaborators, influences, or past mentors. Whether in hypothetical or real scenarios, referencing others’ contributions shows openness and gratitude. This inclusivity suggests the writing journey isn’t solitary but shared. It also positions readers to view themselves as part of an evolving conversation.
• Personal Anecdotes: Encourage resonance by tying lessons to your own stumbling blocks or breakthroughs. Maybe you struggled with pacing on your first project or found creative inspiration while rewatching a childhood favorite. These glimpses provide tangible demonstrations that the principles at hand emerged from lived experiences, not just academic reading.
• Emotional Investment: Write as though you genuinely care about every narrative element. If you detail an anecdote of frustration, highlight how it felt. If you recall a triumphant breakthrough, capture the excitement. This emotional presence invites readers to see your guidance as more than technical skill—it’s human passion for the craft.
Characterization Summary: A method that prioritizes community, real-life storytelling parallels, and heartfelt commitment, letting readers sense active camaraderie in every tip.

6. Crassness (Ever-Present, Nuanced)
• Purposeful Profanity: If you drop a line like “Sometimes you’ve just gotta let them fuck up,” it must serve a clear function: intensifying emotion, highlighting exasperation, or signaling an unfiltered viewpoint. Overuse can desensitize readers, so only employ expletives when they genuinely sharpen the mood or comedic effect.
• Matter-of-Fact About Intimacy: Approach romantic or sexual content with directness. Show the characters’ impulses, awkwardness, and tenderness without indulging in sensational descriptions. Keep the focus on authenticity—what they feel or fear—rather than on provocative detail.
• Underlying Consistency: Let this blunt aspect remain a consistent extension of your honest tone. If you occasionally rely on a sharp word or frank depiction of a private moment, do so throughout. Readers must see it as integral to your style, not an out-of-nowhere shock tactic.
Characterization Summary: A brand of candor that uses bold expressions or references carefully, weaving them into the broader tapestry of honesty and genuine feeling.
