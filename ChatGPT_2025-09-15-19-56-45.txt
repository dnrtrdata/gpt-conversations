I'm going to provide a list of story cliches that I'll then need you to compare overly-specified list of cliches from specific properties. You will compare each specific-property-cliche-list to the original list and either decide the specific cliches are close enough to the original, approved list of cliches -- if they are, you'll change them to the approved cliche; or you'll decide the specific-cliches are not close enough to the original cliches and you'll remove them from the specific list.

The goal is to apply the same list of cliches to a diverse range of story-properties I love to see which cliches I'm comfortable with -- so we need a shared list to compare cliches across these story-properties with the ability to make apples-to-apples comparisons.

Understood?

Understood. I will:

I. Take your master list of approved story clichés as the reference list.
II. Compare each item from any specific-property cliché list against that reference.
III. For each specific cliché:
     1. If it matches or is a close variant of a reference cliché, I will standardize it to the approved version.
     2. If it does not reasonably match any approved cliché, I will remove it from the specific-property list.
IV. This process ensures consistency across all properties so we can meaningfully compare which clichés you tolerate across diverse stories.

Ready when you are. Send the approved cliché list first.

Confirmed. I will apply strict scrutiny to ensure:

I. Only strong semantic and narrative equivalencies result in a match.
II. Superficial resemblance or partial overlap will not qualify—those items will be excluded.
III. Reworded clichés must preserve both narrative function and character dynamics of the original cliché to remain.

Picky lens engaged. Ready for the approved cliché list.
